#### DEDICATION



To all, of whatsoever church or nation, who with love for the Lord Jesus Christ are trying to give His Gospel to Japan, I dedicate this book.

Differing as we do upon so many points, it is easy for us to see what we deem defeats in one another's belief and practice; but if He to whose pure eyes all men must seem so imperfect" is not ashamed to call them brethren" whom He is sanctifying, let us not withhold the name from any that love and follow Him.

May He prosper our work so far as it is in accord with His truth.

May He overrule our mistakes. May His Kingdom come to Japan. May He grant that we, whose notes have now too much of discord, may all at last find ourselves in harmony as we join with the ten thousand times ten thousand and the thousands of thousands in singing:

> "Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honour, and glory, and blessing."





#### FOREWORD



THE definitive history of Christianity in Japan may never be written. Despite the relatively small number of formal believers—less than one per cent of the total population—Christianity has become and is likely to continue to be an important strand in modern Japanese culture. The eager response to Christianity by young intellectuals of samurai background in the second half of the nineteenth century has worked itself deep into the continuing intellectual life of the nation. The Christian social message of the early decades of the twentieth century has become a lasting part of social welfare attitudes and a still perceptible influence in the Socialist political movement. The strong emphasis on education of the Christian missionary movement has left a visible legacy throughout Japanese education, particularly in higher education for women. The international contacts of Christianity and the supranationalism and pacifism of its fundamental teachings are ongoing forces in contemporary Japan.

Otis Cary lived and wrote at a time when such aspects of the history of Christianity in Japan would have seemed somewhat secondary. His two volumes, entitled *A History of Christianity in Japan,* were concerned basically with the missionary movement itself, the churches it founded, and the converts these gathered in. All this, of course, is a very essential part of the story. In Japan, the history of Christianity inevitably begins with the history of Christian missions.

The missionary movement still continues in Japan, though in different form from the days of Otis Cary. From the present perspective, the history of Christian missions in Japan might be divided into four major epochs. The first was the introduction of Catholic Christianity in the sixteenth century, its remarkably rapid spread, and its almost complete extirpation during the first half of the seventeenth century—a fascinating story of great meaning for the time but of little continuing influence on later ages. Next came the period of the reintroduction and early success of Christianity, Protestant and Orthodox as well as Catholic, in the second half of the nineteenth century. This was the golden age of the missionary movement in terms of lasting significance. The third period, from the 1890's up to World War II, saw continued but less dramatic success for the missionary movement under increasingly complex and adverse conditions, while the main story of Christianity in Japan moved away from the missionary effort to the Japanese churches and individual believers. The last period is the postwar phase, in which the missionary movement, though still relatively large in numbers, is only a small peripheral element in Japanese Christianity.

The career of Otis Cary started in the key second period and continued into the third. Writing in 1909, he covered the first phase of the missionary movement in the first half of the volume "Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Missions" and dealt with the second phase in the remainder of that volume and in the second volume, "Protestant Missions," but he made only a tentative start on an analysis of the third phase.

The first period, which lay far back in history, Cary could treat with much of the same historical perspective possible today. The second and most significant period of the history of Christian missions in Japan, he knew as an eyewitness and participant himself. While more recent scholarship has dealt with much of his subject matter in greater detail, with new materials, and from differing angles of vision, it is a tribute to his thoroughness, careful scholarship, and sense of balance that his two volumes should still be in strong demand more than six decades after their first publication. In fact, since he himself was a major participant during the latter part of the nineteenth century, his judgments and evaluations on this phase of the story are not merely secondary materials but in a sense a primary source on this significant period in the history of Christian missions in Japan.

Otis Cary was succeeded in the missionary movement in Japan by his son Frank during the decades before World War II, and Frank's son, the present Otis Cary, who is largely responsible for this republication of his grandfather's famous work, is on the Amherst College faculty on leave as a professor at Doshisha University in Kyoto, where he directs Amberst House, and is a part-time lecturer about Japan in the United States. The focus has shifted and broadened with time, but the family tradition of intercultural work between the United States and Japan continues.

#### PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION



IT may seem odd to republish a work in two volumes long since in the public domain. However, if the requests, and even supplications, from individuals and from libraries are any indication, there is a void that this original work fills in the spiritual history of the inroads of the Christian faith in the older religious fabric of the East. My grandfather was invited to give the Hyde Lectures at Andover Seminary soon after it united with Harvard in 1908. As he notes, these lectures formed the basis of the present work. His was a modest and meticulous approach, bred in the small towns of Congregational New England. Inbred in him was a faith in and concern for records and the written word. Although he would have been glad to use as many other sources as he could, he labored under the "disadvantages" of being a member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which kept unusually complete records for each station and combined them for full reports to headquarters. These volumes have been criticized for this imbalance. He knew, as he put it together, that he would be faulted, and he would have welcomed more material from other denominations.

Fifty years after the introduction of Protestantism to Japan was a most fortunate time, indeed, to make an accounting of the record. With the advent of the Taisho era and after World War I, the Christian spectrum expanded and fragmented astonishingly. The first volume, dealing with the older branches of Christianity of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Churches, has been received by them over the years with considerable respect and appreciation. It is difficult to find anywhere else as many direct quotations from the actual participants. References in recent scholarly literature testify to this.

It was my father, Frank Cary, who had the ambition to write the third volume, bringing the work "up to date." This was not merely an expression of filial piety as exemplified in crates of collected periodicals, tracts, reports, and communications around the house. Instead he was dispatched to spend his final active years on the mission field after World War II recouping, reconstructing, and reconstituting American Board affairs and properties for the new United Church of Christ of Japan. On the one-hundredth anniversary of the introduction of Protestantism in 1959, he consented to remain an extra year to make available some of the record of former years with which he had such a fond familiarity dating from boyhood years.

It was my grandfather's firm conviction that retired missionaries should leave the field, for if the seed was to take root, this could finally be accomplished only by indigenous believers. "Devolution" \(a somewhat un-Darwinian if spiritual phrase\) was an original and constant concern of the American Board, its headquarters in Boston, and its missionaries, It went much against Frank Gary's grain to stay an extra year after his seventieth birthday to put these materials together, for it was his father who chaired the mission committee on retirement policy and procedures, which clearly established that "old wood" could be "dead wood" and should not continue on the field to get in the way of the ongoing work.

Otis Cary returned to active work with Japanese communities in California and Utah and helped establish a church in Ogden. He finally retired in the mid-1920's but vigorously continued his historical and theological research.

It is hardly in the range of my ability or intent as Otis Cary's namesake to undertake the task of "completion" of the original work. Not only has scholarship rushed on, but also the very temper of the religious scene is so different, multidenominatioal, and evolving that it defies any attempt of a junior and imperceiving latecomer.

Revell originally published 2,000 sets of the volumes. After several years, the author was asked what he would like done with the more than one thousand sets still unsold. Missionary salaries being what they were, he bought up only a few sets, and the remainder were turned back into pulp. The demand since then from libraries, which tend to lose the second volume, has been forcible on the descendants\! It is hoped that this reprinting will not only fill library holes but will also provide a solid basis for new scholarship in a world at sea in its search for values in a fragmented and turbulent time. Certainly this is in the spirit of the author and of the manner in which he treated these often exciting historical materials. He would have claimed little for his part in the work. The significance of the indefinite article at the beginning of the title was intentional.

#### PREFACE



IN this volume and one dealing with Protestant Missions in Japan the attempt has been made to write impartially concerning the three great divisions of the Christian Church. Probably, however, complete success has not been attained, for a writer is unconsciously affected by his own prejudices. I will not deny that certain doctrines and practices of the Roman and Greek Churches seem to me gravely erroneous. Members of those churches have the same opinion of what I believe and do. It will be well, however, for all of us to remember that Christ rebuked His disciples for unworthy feelings against those who, though not walking with them, yet cast out demons in His name. If we belong to the Church Universal, we must recognise some degree of fellowship with all followers of Christ and must acknowledge their work for Him as a part of that in which we are engaged. The great missionary to the Gentiles wrote to those that by emphasising differences were in clanger of cutting themselves off from joy in the labours of persons not belonging to their own party: "All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas. . . all are yours and ye are Christ's." While writing of Xavier, Fernandez, Takayama Ukon, Petitjean, and Dominic Senemon; of Archbishop Nicolai and those of his converts who were so earnest in giving the Gospel to their countrymen; I have said: "Yes, if I am Christ's, these men too are mine. I ought to rejoice in what they have accomplished in His name." I am sorry for any person claiming to be a Christian who can read of Verbeck, and Sawayama, and Neesima without a desire to claim them as his brethren. We see defects in others. Alas\! is our own work so perfect that we can point the finger of scorn at theirs? Even the best workers upon God's temple have sometimes intermingled grass, hay, stubble with the gold, silver, and precious stones; but we may well take heed lest we become so occupied with criticising the former that we cannot rejoice in the strength and beauty of the latter.

Notwithstanding what has just been said, the honest historian cannot conceal the faults of those concerning whom he writes. Cromwell's face must be painted with the wart The artist need not, however, write beneath the picture: "Please notice especially the wart," and so I have not specifically drawn attention to what seem unfortunate features in the methods of any Christian workers, but have simply told the facts, usually in the words of the workers themselves or in those used by writers belonging to the same communion.

It will, after all, be evident to the reader that this book has been written by a Protestant. This will explain why some matters that occupy considerable space in such writers as Charlevoix receive but slight notice here; why, for instance, little is said of the miracles ascribed to Xavier and his successors. Even the diction will be found to have something of a Protestant tinge, I am aware that the term *Roman* Catholic is displeasing to some members of the Church to which it is applied. As a rule, it is desirable to speak of a religious body by the name of its own preference; but I trust that in this case the failure to do so will not be regarded as a discourtesy, Some that do not acknowledge the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome make or desire to make the word "Catholic" the title of their own division of Christianity, and the recognised name of one of the leading denominations in Japan is Seikokwai or Holy Catholic Church. Such facts seem to make necessary the use in this book of the term Roman Catholic, The name Greek Orthodox has been chosen as conveying to many readers a clearer idea than would that of Holy Orthodox Church.

Those acquainted with the Japanese language may criticise my way of writing some words. I have omitted the marks that designate long vowels, because they are misleading to the general reader and because it is difficult to secure such accurate proof-reading as would ensure against mistakes. Again, though Japanese nouns have usually no distinction of number, it has seemed best for the sake of clearness to use such plurals as *daimyos,* etc.

As many bibliographical lists have been published there is no necessity for mentioning all of the books consulted in the preparation of this volume. For the early missions, chief reliance has been placed on Charlevoix Crasset, Steichen's "The Christian Daimyo," Cros's "St. François de Xavier," Murdoch and Yamagata's "History of Japan," and papers in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan. Special obligation is acknowledged to Murdoch and Yamagata's work for its help in connecting events narrated by European writers with those found in Japanese records. In several cases its translations have been adopted in this book. The intensely interesting work of Abbé Marnas, "La Religion de Jésus Ressuscité? au Japon," and the letters of Mgr. Forcade published under the title," Le Premier Missionnaire du Japon an XIXe Siècle," have been the chief sources of information concerning the earlier years of the modern Roman Catholic missions. For more recent years I have depended on the "Annals of the Propagation of the Faith," the reports of the *Société des Missions Etrangères,* and various periodicals.

The first part of a history of the Greek Orthodox Mission has been published in the Japanese language under the title *"Nippon Seikyo Dendo Shi."* In English, there is nothing available except a few articles in magazines; and I am informed by Archbishop Nicolai that, even in the Russian language, little has been published concerning the mission of which he is the head.

A considerable portion of what is found in this book was used in the Hyde Lectures on Foreign Missions, given at Andover Theological Seminary in December, 1908.

ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSIONS







### THE CALL TO JAPAN



THE first attempt to carry the Gospel to Japan was made by Christopher Columbus.

Nearly two centuries before the discoverer of America set out upon his memorable voyage, a Venetian merchant, who had recently been taken captive in a naval battle, was confined in a prison of Genoa, the city that afterwards became the birthplace of Columbus. The prisoner, who had spent many years in travelling through distant lands, was wont to relieve the tedium of confinement by telling his companions about the many strange things he had seen and heard. Among those that listened to his stories was a prisoner from Pisa, a man who had already written a few books and who saw that these tales furnished excellent material for another. It was at his request that Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant, dictated the narrative that gave to Europeans much more knowledge of the Far East than they had before possessed. One day he spoke as follows of a country which he himself had not visited, but of which he had often heard during his sojourn at the court of Kublai Khan:

"Zipangu is an island towards the cast in the high seas, fifteen hundred miles distant from the Continent, and a very great island it is. The people are white, civilised, and well-favoured. They are idolaters and are dependent on nobody. And I can tell yon, the quantity of gold they have is endless; for they find it in their own island, and the king does not allow it to be exported. Moreover, few merchants visit the country, because it is so far from the mainland, and thus it comes to pass that their gold is abundant beyond all measure.

"I will tell you a wonderful thing about the palace of the lord of that island. You must know that he hath a great palace which is entirely roofed with fine gold, just as our churches are roofed with lead, insomuch that it would scarcely be possible to estimate its value. Moreover, all the pavement of the palace and the floors of its chambers are entirely of gold, in plates like slabs of stone a good two fingers thick; and the windows also are of gold so that altogether the richness of this palace is past all bounds and all belief. They have also pearls in abundance, which are of a rose colour, but fine, big, and round, and quite as valuable as the white ones.

.              .              .              .              .              .              .

"Now you must know that the idols of Cathay and of Manzi and of this island are all of the same class. And of this island as well as elsewhere, there be some of the idols that have the head of an ox, some have the head of a pig, some of a dog, some of a sheep, and some of divers other kinds. And some of them have four heads, whilst some have three, one growing out of either shoulder. There are also some that have four hands, some ten, some a thousand. And they do put more faith in those idols that have a thousand hands than in any of the others. And when any Christian asks them why they make their idols in so many different guises and not all alike, they reply that just so their forefathers were wont to have them made, and just so they will leave them to their children, and these to after generations, and so they will be handed down for ever. And you must understand that the deeds ascribed to these idols are such a parcel of deviltries as it is best not to tell." \(*Yule's Translation.\)*

It has been doubted whether Columbus had read Marco Polo's book before he started upon his voyage of discovery. One reason for supposing he had done so is that in the Biblioteca Colombina at Seville is a copy of the first Latin printed edition \(1485\) with notes in what is thought to be his handwriting. At all events, it was only through Polo that information concerning Japan had reached Europe; and thus, either directly or indirectly, he had an important part in exciting the zeal of Columbus for his great undertaking. Since Zipangu was the most eastern of all the lands described by the Venetian, Columbus believed that it would be the first one reached in sailing westward from Europe. The gold with which it was said to abound did not furnish the sole incentive for seeking the island: Columbus hoped to extend the blessings of Christianity to this and other lands that he might discover. When he came to write an account of his expedition, he said in the prologue addressed to his royal patrons:

"The Grand Khan of the Mongols and his predecessors had many times sent to Rome asking that doctors of our holy faith be sent to instruct them. The Holy Father had never provided these teachers; and thus many people perished while believing in their idols and imbibing the doctrines of perdition. Therefore Your Highnesses, as Catholic Christians and princes, lovers and promoters of the holy Catholic faith, and enemies of the sect of Mahomet as of all idolatries and heresies, determined to send me, Christopher Columbus, the said parts of India that I might see the said princes with their people and lands, might discover the nature and disposition of all, and might devise means to be taken for their conversion to our holy faith."

Thus we see that, whatever other considerations may have had weight with Columbus, the missionary motive was professedly, and we may believe actually, the most prominent in his mind and in that of his patrons.

The people if the regions reached on the first voyage showed so man signs of poverty that Columbus could not consider them the inhabitants of Zipangu. They possessed, however, some gold ornaments, and the signs made by them when asked the place from which these were obtained nourished the hope that the land of golden palaces was not far away.

Six of the natives whom Columbus brought back, and whom he supposed to be Asiatics, were baptised with great ceremony at Barcelona; King Ferdinand, Queen Isabella, and Prince John acting as sponsors. The Pope appointed a Benedictine monk to be vicar apostolic in the newly discovered lands, and eleven members of the same order accompanied Columbus on his second voyage. The queen gave into their care some sacred vessels and vestments taken from her own chapel. Although the opinion of Columbus that Cuba was Cathay gained acceptance, Zipangu was believed to be near that land and so was doubtless included in the thought of those who made these provisions for the extension of their religion to the regions beyond the western ocean.

It was half a century later when Europeans really reached Japan. Though it is not certainly known who were the first to do this, the honour is usually ascribed to some Portuguese mariners, who in 1542 were driven thither from the Chinese coast by a storm. Mendez Pinto, in an account of his travels, that he prepared near the close of his life, claimed the discovery for himself and his companions; but there are many reasons for doubting the truth of his statements.

To Francis Xavier\* was given the privilege of leading the first company of missionaries to Japan. The place that this remarkable man holds in ecclesiastical history as the" Apostle to Japan" justifies a somewhat extended notice of his life. He was born at the castle of Xavier in Navarre, April 7, 1506. At the age of eighteen he entered the University of Paris, where he became acquainted with Ignatius Loyola. He was one of the six who united in forming the Society of Jesus. War and other obstacles having interfered with the original plans of these associates, who had hoped to go to the Holy Land in order to attempt the conversion of the Mohammedans, they spent some time in Italy, teaching, preaching, working in hospitals, and completing the organisation of their society. In addition to their former vows of chastity and poverty, they now took that of obedience, binding themselves to perform whatsoever the reigning pontiff might command. They held themselves ready to go forth among Turks, heathen, or heretics, as he should direct, and this they were to do without hesitation or delay, as also without question, condition, or reward.

The King of Portugal applied to the Jesuits for missionaries who should seek the conversion of the nations that had lately been conquered in India. At first Rodriguez and Bobadilla were selected for this service; but the sudden illness of the latter made it impossible for him to go at once. Loyola, who was also ill, called Xavier to his bedside, and in the name of the Pope commanded him to set out the next day for Portugal in order to make arrangements for the mission. Rodriguez had already started, and Xavier was to follow in the company of the Portuguese ambassador. The few hours at his disposal gave him barely time to repair his worn garments, say farewell to his friends, and receive the Pope's blessing.\*

Rodriguez \(who is not to be confounded with others of the same name who afterwards went to Japan\) finally remained in Portugal; but Xavier with two other Jesuits proceeded to Goa, which was reached May 6, 1542, In this city, the capital of the Portuguese possessions, he began those missionary labours that have made his name famous. Two classes of people claimed his attention—the Europeans and the natives. It would be hard to say which had sunk lower in the scale of morals. He visited patients in the hospital, preached to the Portuguese, distributed alms, and gave much time to the instruction of children. It was hard for him to remain quiet long in one place, and he visited various parts of India, besides many of the Spice Islands. One of his letters describes his methods of preaching to those natives who were nominally Christians. He says:

"Their native language is the Malabar; mine, the Basque, They do not understand mine nor I theirs. Accordingly I brought together the wisest among them and sought out some men who knew both tongues. After that, in numerous sessions and with great labour, we wrote out the forms of prayer; first, that of the Sign of the Cross accompanied with the Confession of the Three Persons of the Trinity; then the Creed, the Commandments, the Pater Noster, Ave Maria, Salve Regina, and the Confiteor; translating all from Latin into the Malabar language. I learned these formulas by heart, and then, a bell in my hand, I went out collecting all whom I could, children and adults, in the place where I was staying. Two times a day for a month I taught them the prayers. What the children learned they were to teach \(it soon became a regular institution\) to their lathers and mothers, to all the people in their houses, and to their neighbours. Sundays I assembled all the inhabitants of the place, men and women, old and young, to say the prayers in their own language. They manifested great pleasure in this exercise. They came very gladly and forthwith recited aloud the Creed in their own tongue, commencing with the confession of one only God in three Persons First I uttered the words, and all followed. At the close of this recitation of the Creed, I repeated it myself alone, article by article, stopping after each one. I made them observe that to be a Christian meant nothing else than firmly and without hesitation to believe the twelve articles. Then, since they declared themselves to be Christians, I demanded concerning each article if they firmly believed it, at which the men and women, old and young, with their hands crossed upon their breasts, would always answer, 'Yes,'"

After describing how he taught the prayers and Commandments, Xavier continued:

"In the country where I now am the multitude of those who become converts to the faith of Jesus Christ is so great that my arms often grow weary with baptising, and I am unable to speak any longer. . . I have baptised a whole village in a day."

So much has been written about the success of Xavier's work in India that a reader of his letters is surprised to find that he was greatly disappointed over the results. In 1548 he wrote to a fellow-worker urging him to baptise as many children as possible, for, asked he, "Do you not see that few Indians, white or black, will go to paradise, if one excepts the children of fourteen years and under who die in ignorance of evil?" The next year he wrote to Loyola:

"The experience that I have of these countries shows me clearly that there is no possible hope of perpetuating the Society here by means of the native Indians. Christianity itself will survive only so long as we remain and live here—we who have already come or those whom you shall send."

In a letter to Rodriguez he said:

"From the experience I have had I see only one way and means by which the service of our Lord can be greatly promoted in India. It is this. Whoever may be governor of India, let the King give him a letter of introduction saying, 'In India there are none of the ministers of religion \(here the King should mention the Society of Jesus first of all\) on whom I so much depend as I do upon you for the extension in those countries of the faith of Jesus Christ, and therefore I command you to make the Island of Ceylon Christian and to cause the Christian community of Cape Comorin to increase. . . . Let him say to the governors, 'I swear that unless you clear my conscience by making many Christians in India, I will cause you on your return to Lisbon to be arrested and put in irons. You will remain long years in prison and I will confiscate all your property. ' Let the King talk thus to the governors. Let him then give his orders, and let all disobedience and neglect be severely punished. Then there will be many Christians gained in this country; but there will not be in any other way."

These and many similar expressions showing how much Xavier depended upon political power for the promotion of religious ends, help us to see why he and his successors, on going to Japan, sought with so much earnestness the conversion of the Shogun and the feudal lords.

It was while Xavier was feeling so discouraged over the condition of affairs in India and considering whether he should go elsewhere, that his thoughts were turned toward Japan. He was in Malacca when there came to him a young Japanese who in Xavier's letters is called Anjiro.\* The main features of this man's story may best be told by giving the letter which he wrote November 29, 1548, to the Society of Jesus:

"Paul of Japan sends to Father Ignatius and to other Fathers and Brothers of the Society of Jesus the peace, grace, and love of Jesus Christ that He may be glorified and the holy faith extended.

"It had pleased Him who chose me from my mother's womb \(coming, as He did, to seek wandering and lost sheep\) not to forget me who was so far separate from Himself, but to bring me out from the darkness, leading me into the light and to a place of safety through the faith of Jesus Christ, the Restorer of our souls. . . How this favour of the Lord came to me I wish to relate in order that He may be blessed and praised.

"While yet in my native country of Japan and still an infidel, it came to pass that for certain reasons I slew a man. To escape arrest, I fled by night to a Buddhist monastery. While I was there, a Portuguese vessel came to the city. One Alonzo Vaz, whom I had formerly known, happened to be on board. As soon as he learned what had happened to me, he invited me to sail with him from Japan. His departure was delayed, and fearing lest I should incur further risk, he gave me a letter of recommendation to a friend who was staying in the same port. In the darkness of the night I mistook the vessel and gave the letter to George Alvarez instead of Ferdinand Alvarez, to whom it was addressed. The former, however, received me in the kindest manner and offered to take me to Father Francis, with whom he was intimately acquainted. From what was told me about Father Francis and his works I conceived a strong desire to be with him.

"Setting sail we came to Malacca. On the voyage George Alvarez had taught me what it is to be a Christian so that I was already somewhat inclined to receive baptism. My desire for this kept increasing day by day, and I should quickly have become a Christian on this first visit to Malacca if the vicar in that city would have baptised me. He asked me who I was and in what condition I lived. I informed him that I was married and expected to go back to my home. Thereupon he refused baptism, saying that if I received it I could not return to be the husband of a pagan woman. Therefore, when the monsoon favourable for sailing to Japan commenced to blow, I embarked on a vessel bound for China where I could avail myself at the proper time of a ship going to Japan.

"Setting sail from China to Japan \(a seven or eight days journey, or two hundred leagues\) we came within about twenty leagues of the coast of my country. While in sight of it we were overtaken by a violent tempest; the wind blowing from the land and so against us. The weather was so thick that we did not know where we were. This lasted four days and nights. Every one was in terrible distress and cried for mercy. It was finally necessary to return to the Chinese port from which we had set out.

"That storm, which thus brought me back to China, gave me cause for reflection. Moreover my desire to be a Christian and to be instructed in the faith had never left me. I was in doubt what I ought to do. Then I met the Portuguese, Alonzo Vaz, who in my own country had first encouraged me to go to Malacca, He was much surprised when he heard how I had left Malacca and had been driven back to China by the tempest. As he was then about sailing to Malacca, he asked me to accompany him. An honourable man named Lorenzo Botelho united with him in urging me to go. 'Return to Malacca.' said he, 'I believe that you will find Father Francis there. From Malacca you will go to the College of St. Paul at Goa in India. There you will be instructed in the faith and afterwards some one of the Fathers will go with you to Japan.'

"This advice seemed good and I set forth with joy. On coming to Malacca, I at once met George Alvarez, who hastened to bring me to Father Francis. We found him in a church where he was conducting a marriage service. George Alvarez introduced me and told him my history. The great joy with which Father Francis looked on me and welcomed me was sufficient to show that all things had been brought about by God's providence. The further I go, the more fully do I understand this. Already the mere sight of Father Francis had given me satisfaction and comfort. I was able to talk with him, for I could understand a little of what was said in Portuguese and could also speak some words.

"The Father at once told me to go to the College of St. Paul in company with George Alvarez, who was setting out for Goa. Father Francis was going to visit the Christians of Cape Com or in and proceed from there to Goa. He did not delay on the way, for hardly had I arrived in the beginning of March, 1548, at the College of St. Paul when he came, only four or five days after me. Great was my joy at seeing him. Indeed, from the first moment that I had seen him, I was conscious of a holy emotion which inspired in my heart the desire to be in his service and never to leave him.

"While in the college I gained such a knowledge of the faith that I was baptised in May of that year on the Day of Pentecost. On the same day was also baptised my servant, whom I had brought from Japan and who is now here with me.

"I hope that God, the Creator of all things, and Jesus Christ who was crucified for our redemption will cause all that has happened to redound to their glory and to the propagation of the faith. The special mercies that I have received from the Lord convince me of the truth of Christianity; while further witness is given by many proofs and by the quiet and peace which filled my soul. May God in His mercy grant that I may not be ungrateful for such benefits nor for the intelligence, memory, and persistency with which the Fathers of the College say He has endowed me. They are astonished at the impression the things of God make upon me, that in so short a time I have learned to read and write so well and that I have been able to understand such exalted doctrines, and that I have learned by heart the Gospel of Matthew, which I have written in Japanese characters and divided into sections so as to remember it the better. Your Reverences will find specimens of the Japanese characters and writing enclosed with this letter.

"For the love of our Lord, obtain for me by your prayers that He who has given me so much will not allow the gifts to remain without fruit, but that all may redound to His praise and glory.

"Pray too that our Lord will aid Father Francis, who is preparing for the voyage to Japan; also that I may have the courage to give my life a thousand times, if necessary, for the love of God. For this I greatly need the powerful aid of Father Ignatius, Father Antonio Gomez, and other members of the Society of Jesus. Let them constantly recommend me to God's favour, for I hope in our Lord that He will gain for Himself much fruit in Japan, and that before I die I shall see a college of the Society established there for the glory of Jesus Christ and the propagation of the faith. Amen.

"Goa, Nov. 29, 1548.
> > > "Your servant in Jesus Christ,> > > > > > "Paul of the Holy Faith \(a Japanese\)."\*
The name "Paul of the Holy Faith" was received by him at baptism, this being the designation of the College at Goa. His servant took the name Anthony. A third Japanese, who had likewise been sent by Xavier from Malacca to Goa, was baptised as John.

It was in reply to Xavier's question, "If I went to Japan, would the people become Christians?" that Anjiro made his famous reply, "My people would not immediately become Christians; but they would first ask you a multitude of questions, weighing carefully your answers and your claims. Above all, they would observe whether your conduct agreed with your words. If you should satisfy them on these points—by suitable replies to their inquiries and by a life above reproach—then, as soon as the matter was known and fully examined, the king \[daimyo\], the nobles, and the educated people would become Christians. Six months would suffice; for the nation is one that always follows the guidance of reason."

In January, 1549, Xavier wrote to Paul; "In the space of eight months he has learned to read, write, and speak Portuguese," At one time he was heard sighing and exclaiming: "Oh, unhappy people of Japan, who adore the creatures that God made to be your servants\!" When Xavier asked, "Paul, why do you talk thus?" the answer was, "I was thinking of my countrymen who adore the sun and moon, whereas those luminaries are servants to the men who know the Lord Jesus, They were made to illumine the day and night in order that by their light we might serve God upon the earth and glorify His Son, Jesus Christ"

The fervent, restless spirit of Xavier was moved with an earnest desire to carry Christianity to Japan. No sooner did he broach the subject to his friends than he was assailed by a multitude of objections. He was told that there was so much work to be done in the Portuguese colonies that he could not he spared. In reply, he pointed to other Jesuits who had already come to India, and to the fact that more were expected. When the dangers of the undertaking were portrayed, he asked if the servants of God ought to be less willing than the merchants to run risks. In one of his letters he says, after writing of the dangers from tempests, shoals, and pirates: "It is doing well if two out of four vessels make the journey in safety; but were I certain of finding myself in greater perils than those already experienced, I would not give up going to Japan, so strong is the impression on my mind and so great hope do I have in God that I shall see our holy religion propagated there."

Xavier chose Father Cosmo Torres and Brother Juan Fernandez to accompany him in his new undertaking. The former was a Spanish priest who had been on board a ship that touched at the Moluccas while Xavier was sojourning in those islands. Being greatly impressed by what he saw of Xavier and his work, he would gladly have remained with him; but for some reason it was necessary for him to go to Goa, where for a time he served as a parish priest before being admitted into the Society of Jesus. Juan Fernandez had been a rich silk merchant of Cordova. His business led him to Lisbon, and there he was one day invited by a friend to attend a service of the Jesuits, where it was said he could hear the sweetest music to which he had ever listened. On going to the church, Juan found a gathering of over two hundred men belonging to a fraternity that met every week for devotion and penance. After a sermon the lights were extinguished, while the men with tears and groans for their sins began to scourge their bared backs and to beg divine pardon. The young merchant was so much moved by these proceedings that lie at once sought out Father Rodriguez and asked to be received into the Society as a lay-brother. Rodriguez, in doubt whether the young man had sufficient of the spirit of self-renunciation, asked whether, as a proof of sincerity, he was willing, richly dressed as he was, to ride on a donkey through the chief street of Lisbon with his face toward the animal's tail. As Fernandez gladly met the test, he was soon afterwards received into the Society. Xavier wished to have him enter the priesthood before sailing to Japan; but Fernandez begged permission to remain in his humbler position as a lay brother.

Xavier's fame has unduly eclipsed that of his companions. If to him belongs the honour of planning the mission and inspiring them with zeal to enter upon it, they were the ones who did the more solid work. They remained in Japan the rest of their lives, learned the language of its people, and laid the foundations of the Roman Catholic Church in that land, Fernandez proved the most apt of the company in acquiring the Japanese language and in reaching the hearts of the people. Father Torres once said concerning him: "Very little would be accomplished in Japan if we should lose Brother Juan Fernandez."

In addition to the three Jesuits and the three Japanese, there were two servants who accompanied them from Goa. One was a native of Malabar, by the name of Amador, and the other was a Chinese named Manuel. The little company went first to Malacca, where they hoped to find some vessel that would take them to their destination. There they received intelligence that gave them much encouragement to believe that God was preparing the Japanese people to welcome them. A letter written from Malacca by Xavier says:

"On our arrival we were given many items of news from Japan. There had come letters from Portuguese merchants who were in that country. They informed me that a great lord in those islands desired to be a Christian and had despatched an ambassador to the Governor of India asking that some Fathers be sent to teach him our religion. They also wrote that in one place visited by the Portuguese traders the lord of the land had given them an abandoned house for *their* lodging. It was one that the people of the country did not wish to occupy, because, as they said, it was haunted by an evil spirit. The Portuguese established themselves there, but soon they felt something pulling at their clothes. When they looked around to find who was doing this, they could see nothing. This caused them much alarm. Among them was a boy, who one night commenced to cry out aloud. The Portuguese all arose and ran to him with their weapons, thinking that they were being attacked. When they asked the boy the reason of his cries, he replied that a vision had frightened him and made him call out. After this the boy set up many crosses about the house, and nothing more occurred to alarm the Portuguese. The men of the town had heard the boy's cries and they asked an explanation. It was given to them, and it was then that the lord of the place told the merchants that the house was haunted. He asked them if they knew any way of driving out the evil spirit; whereupon they replied that there was nothing better than the sign of the holy cross. As the Portuguese had placed crosses inside and outside their house, the Japanese began to do the same thing to theirs."\*

No Portuguese ship was ready for the voyage to Japan, a circumstance that Paul attributed to God's special providence, since, as he said: "If my countrymen should see on the one hand Master Francis preaching the holy law of God, and at the same time should also see the Christian merchants doing contrary to the same law, they would form their judgment of it rather from the deeds of the merchants than from the words of the preacher, and would ask Master Francis how could it be that the Christians look forward to the good things of heaven after death if they live now as if there were no goods but those of this world. I thank God that no European enters Japan along with Francis."

The implication in this last statement is not exact, for, in addition to the two other missionaries, Xavier was accompanied on this voyage by a Portuguese named Domingo Diaz, of whom we know almost nothing, except that Xavier describes him as a very great. friend of mine."

Being unwilling to delay, the party embarked on a junk belonging to a Chinese corsair. The Commandant of Malacca tried to make their journey less disagreeable by providing a variety of supplies. To these he added many valuable articles that could be used as gifts for gaining the good will of the Japanese rulers.

The following extract is from an account that Xavier wrote of the voyage:

"A hundred leagues from Malacca on our way towards China, we touched at an island where our people provided themselves with tillers and other pieces of timber that were needed in preparation for the great storms of those Chinese waters. After this, they made many sacrifices to their idol, held a feast in its honour, worshipped many times, and then by casting lots inquired from it whether or not we should have a good wind. The reply was that the weather would be favourable and that it was not necessary to wait longer. The anchors were weighed and we set sail. All were in good spirits; the pagans putting trust in their idol, which with much ceremony they had installed in the stern of the ship, where they surrounded it with lighted candles and burned incense before it; while our trust was in God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His Sou, for whose love and in whose service we had come to preach our holy faith.

"After a while the heathen again cast lots, asking the idol if our ship would return from Japan to Malacca. The reply was that the ship would reach Japan, but would not come back to Malacca. This had the effect of deterring them from going to Japan. They decided to winter in China and wait there until the next year. Judge by this how annoying it was for us to be on a voyage where the question of proceeding or not was left to the decision of a demon and his followers; for, in fact, those that commanded the ship did only what the demon through these lots ordered them to do.

"Going on our way, we came off the coast of a country called Cochin-China, a little before reaching China but not far from it, when two disasters befell us on the same day. It was the eve of the feast of St. Mary Magdalene. The sea was high and very boisterous. The ship's sink had carelessly been left open. As the Chinese Manuel, our companion, was passing near it, the violent rolling of the ship caused him to stumble and fall in. We thought he would be dead from such a fall and because the sink was full of water; but God did not permit him to die. For a long time he was head downward with more than half of his body submerged. With much trouble we drew him out insensible, and he suffered many d. ays from a severe wound on the head, but it pleased our Lord to restore him to health.

"We had just finished dressing Manuel's wounds when the storm made the vessel give a great pitch, thus throwing the pilot's daughter into the sea. The violence of the tempest was such that we were unable to rescue the girl, who was drowned close by the ship in sight of her father and of us all. It was pitiable to hear the groaning and wailing of the poor pagans during the day and night that followed; pitiable too to see the misery of their souls. They passed the time in making constant sacrifices or feasts to their idol, slaying many birds and offering food and drink. The lots that they cast were to find out the reason for the girl's death. The answer was that, if our Manuel had died when he tumbled into the sink of the ship, the girl would not have fallen into the sea."

After the storm had subsided the boat proceeded to Canton. It was only with great difficulty that the captain was dissuaded from remaining in that port. Finally he consented to go to another city, but just as they reached its harbour, where they expected to spend the winter, since the assertion was made that the season for sailing to Japan was nearly past, a boat came out to warn them that the port was infested with pirates. This so frightened the captain that he would have turned back to Canton had it not been that the wind was adverse, while it was favourable for going to Japan, whither they therefore directed their course. It thus came to pass that on August 15, 1549, they reached Kagoshima, the largest city in Paul's native province of Satsuma. The journey from Malacca had occupied only seven weeks.

\* The best life of Xavier in English is that of H. J. Coleridge \(London. 1886\). It is largely made up of Xavier's letters. It will be seen, however, that the extracts from the letters contained in the present book sometimes differ very much from Coleridge's translation. This is because much use has been made of Cros's "Saint François de Xavier, Sa Vie et Ses Lettres" \(Paris and Toulouse, 1900\). Cros has made a careful study of existing manuscripts and has thus freed the letters from the amplifications and changes introduced by editors and translators.

### FRANCIS XAVIER IN JAPAN 1549-1551



IN order that the events to be described in the following chapters may be better understood, it will be well to pause at this point in order to consider some of the political, social, and religious conditions of Japan at the time when Xavier and his companions reached its shores.

From ancient times the country had been divided into sixty-six provinces. Though the names by which these were designated have continued in use until the present day, the territories of the feudal lords were seldom coterminous with these divisions. In some cases a daimyo possessed several provinces, while in others a single province was divided between two or more of these barons, Xavier and his associates applied the name of "king" to these feudal lords; and there was much to justify the nomenclature, for many of them were practically sovereigns within their own estates, having little occasion to concern themselves about any person who might claim superiority over them.

The nominal ruler of the whole country was the Mikado, to whom alone the name of Emperor could properly be applied. Since a. d. 793, the Imperial residence had been in Kyoto. As the Japanese designation for a capital is "*miyako, "* we find this word under various forms of spelling \(most commonly "Meaco"\) used in older European books as though it were the name of the city. The Emperor possessed but little real authority at the time when Xavier came to Japan. Since the twelfth century the power had been in the hands of military rulers who obtained for themselves the title Sei-i Tai-' Shogun, or Barbarian-Expel ling Great-General. The name Shogun, originally applied to all generals, came in time to he restricted in common use to the holder of the longer title. He nominally held his commission from the Emperor; but, as different families gained military ascendency, they were able to assert their claims to the office, which in practice became hereditary except as one family succeeded in supplanting another, thus setting up a new dynasty of rulers. The distinction between nominal and real power did not stop at this point. It often happened that a vassal of the Shogun would hold such a position towards him as the Shogun held towards the Emperor. These regents took care that their nominal superiors were kept as mere puppets, unable to assert themselves or to take any active part in public affairs. Children, only four or five years old, were made emperors or shoguns, were surrounded in their palaces with everything that tended to make them effeminate, and then, as they neared the age when there was any possibility of their becoming dangerous, were set aside for other children.

The Imperial power was at its lowest ebb under the shoguns of the Ashikaga family, whose rule began in 1338. As the revenues were chiefly absorbed during this period by the shogunate, the Emperor and the court nobles were ill provided with means for supporting their dignity. In one case the coronation ceremony was for lack of money postponed twenty-two years, and was finally made possible only by a contribution from the head of one of the Buddhist temples. The body of one Emperor lay unburied for forty days because a sum of money equal to about two thousand dollars could not be collected for the expenses of the funeral.

This period was marked by a succession of civil conflicts. Ashikaga Takauji, the first of his line, after failing to gain possession of the occupant of the throne, set up another person as Emperor and obtained from him the appointment as Shogun. For half a century there were two lines of rival claimants to the Imperial power; one supported by Ashikaga remaining in Kyoto, while the other dwelt in the mountains of Yamato. Dissensions afterwards arose in the Ashikaga family itself; or rather, those among its vassals who desired to gain the office of Prime Minister upheld different members of the house as claimants of the shogunate. At one time there were five of these rival shoguns.

As a result of the wars between the factions, Kyoto and the neighbouring provinces were greatly impoverished. Japanese historians say that the capital was filled with mountains of the slain, while the rivers ran with blood. Great conflagrations left behind them heaps of blackened ruins. Many of the people fled to the mountains for safety. Gardens and fields were left without cultivation. Famine and pestilence added their horrors to those of war; while an unusual number of typhoons and earthquakes seemed to show that nature was ready by the use of its most stupendous forces to help men in their work of destruction. Kyoto was still disturbed by civil strife at the time the missionaries began their labours in japan; and twenty-four years later the Ashikaga family was brushed aside by a militant daimyo named Nobunaga.

The lack of a strong central government had left the feudal lords in the provinces free to fight among themselves as they might please. Those that were strong added the lands of weaker lords to their own. On the other hand, a retainer left in charge of some outlying castle might shake off allegiance to his former daimyo, becoming an independent lord or perhaps inducing others to help him in an attempt to supplant his former master. There was not the great separation, between classes that afterwards made the soldiers so distinct from the farmers and artisans. Men were needed for attack and defence; whoever was able and willing to fight could easily find military employment. Some of the most powerful lords cherished ambitions for extending their influence over the whole country. To accomplish this, each schemed how he might gradually make his way towards Kyoto, where, by obtaining possession of Shogun and Emperor, he could become the real ruler of the land. It was finally from one of the small daimiates that there arose a warrior who was able to accomplish more than others had done. This was Oda Nobunaga, who in 1549—the year Xavier reached Japan—succeeded to his father's estates in the province of Owari. The history of the early missions in Japan synchronises with that of the process by which the government became centralised; a movement begun by Nobunaga, greatly advanced by Hideyoshi, and brought to completion by the early Tokugawa rulers.

The early religion of the Japanese was Shinto. The name signifies the Way of the Superior Beings. It combined nature-worship with reverence for ancestors. Buddhism entered the country from Korea about the middle of the sixth century. At first its progress was but slow. Gradually, however, it became the leading religion of the land, its success being in large part due to the promulgation of the theory that the beings hitherto worshipped by the Japanese were incarnations of Buddhist saints. Though the two religions became combined in such a way that the mass of the people made little distinction between them, the Buddhist elements in the admixture exerted the greater influence upon the religious thought and life of the nation. Some of the temples became very wealthy and powerful. The priests often took an active part in political and even in military movements. The monasteries were in many cases strong fortresses whose inmates were better trained in the use of the sword than in the ceremonies of worship. Often the monks of two opposing sects engaged in active warfare, attacking and burning each other's temples. They also took sides with rival claimants to the shogunate and other offices. Those that had their headquarters on Mt. Hiei, an eminence overlooking Kyoto, were specially-noted for their turbulence. Sometimes, when displeased at action taken in the name of the Emperor, they would march down from the mountain, those in the front ranks carrying the sacred cars on their shoulders, while others clad in full armour followed after them. On arriving at the gates of the palace, they would demand in the name of religion that their protests be heard. Petitions backed by such a display of force were not to be lightly dismissed. In the eleventh century the Emperor Shirakawa, who after a nominal abdication of imperial power still wielded it with a vigour shown by few of those who have ruled Japan, once said to a flatterer who praised his achievements: "There are three things that I have never succeeded in controlling—the throw of the dice, the flooded waters of the Kamo River, and the monks of Mt. Hiei. "Kyoto was often burned, pillaged, and filled with bloodshed through the contests that these turbulent priests waged with other sects or with their political enemies.

Buddhism was at the height of its influence at the period with which we have to do. Murdoch writes: "It is no exaggeration to say that at the date of the first arrival of Europeans in Japan the greatest political power in the empire was that of the Buddhist priesthood. "As a natural consequence, those that desired power for themselves were ready to welcome whatever seemed likely to weaken that of Buddhism. This is doubtless the chief reason why Nobunaga showed such favour to the missionaries; and it had much to do with the readiness of many feudal lords to receive into their territories the men whom they hoped to utilise as instruments for diminishing the arrogance of the Buddhist priests. Yet it must be remembered that some daimyos were devoted Buddhists and that the custom of having their younger sons enter the priesthood greatly increased the political power of the monasteries.

Kagoshima, the port at which Xavier landed, was in the territories of the Daimyo Shimazu Takahisa. He and Otomo Yoshishige of Bungo, from whose port Xavier was to sail when he returned to India, were the most powerful lords in the island of Kyushu.

A letter written by Xavier shows that his reception in Japan was such as greatly encouraged him. In it he says:

"We have been received by the Governor \(*Capitan*\) of the city and by the Commandant \(*Alcayde*\)\* with much kindness and friendship, as we have also been by all the people. They are much surprised to see priests from the land of the Portuguese. Far from thinking It strange that Paul has become a Christian, they greatly approve what he has done. All of them, whether relatives or strangers, have congratulated him on having gone to India and there beholding things which have never been seen in Japan. The Duke of the country has himself congratulated Paul, receiving him with honour and asking many questions upon the manners and the power of the Portuguese. To the great satisfaction of the Duke, Paul has given a full account of all these things. This Duke lives five leagues from Kagoshima. When Paul went to speak with him, he carried a very sacred picture that we had brought from India. It represented Our Lady holding in her arms the Child Jesus. The Duke was so delighted at seeing it that he knelt before the picture of Our Lord and Our Lady, reverencing them with great respect and ordering all his attendants to do the same.\* Then the painting was shown to his mother, who looked upon it with the greatest pleasure. Paul returned to Kagoshima, where we reside, and a few days later there came a gentleman whom the Duke's mother had sent with orders to have the picture copied. More than one thing was lacking for doing this, and so the plan was abandoned. The same lady also asked that she might be given in writing an account of the Christian faith. Paul devoted several days to the task, and wrote to some length upon the subject in his own language.

"Believe me and give thanks to God; the way is open for carrying out your desires. If we knew how to speak, we should ere this have reaped much fruit. Paul has been so active preaching day and night to a great number of his kinsmen and friends that through his efforts his mother, his daughter, many other relatives, both men and women, and also many friends have already become Christians.

"No one is surprised in this country if a person becomes a Christian, Since most people can read and write, they quickly learn the prayers. May our Lord be pleased to give us the tongue with which to speak of divine things, for then by His grace and favour we shall produce much fruit. At present we are like statues in the midst of the people. They talk and have much to say concerning us, while we, being ignorant of the language, remain silent. We are reduced to the necessity of making ourselves little children and learning to talk."

Xavier with the help of Paul prepared an account of the principal Christian doctrines. This he wrote out in Roman characters for his own use in order that he might read it before the people. In the processes connected with Xavier's canonisation the claim was made that he was endowed, sometimes at least, with miraculous power to use languages that he had never learned. Fourteen witnesses were found who testified that he spoke the languages of the countries visited by him, as freely and elegantly as though he had been born in those lands; that not infrequently men of different nations hearing him at the same time could all understand his meaning; and that when he first came to Japan "he preached without an interpreter, partly in Spanish, partly in Latin, partly in Portuguese, with a few Japanese words intermingled, and was understood by all as if he had spoken in the native language of each."

It hardly needs to be said that Xavier's letters contain no references to such marvels. On the contrary, there are several passages that show his inability to speak readily to the people. Besides using Paul and afterwards Fernandez as interpreters, much of his work was done by reading or repeating from memory the words of what he calls his "semi-Japanese volume."

It had been Xavier's desire to go directly to Kyoto; but in the letter from which quotations have already been made he says that the winds made this impossible and that it would be necessary for him to wait five months before they would be favourable. Meanwhile the Lord of Satsuma gave permission for the teaching of Christianity in his domains and for its acceptance by any of his subjects. The first converts, as we have seen, were in Paul's family, and after them came a young fisherman to whom the name Bernard was given. He afterwards accompanied Xavier in his travels through Japan and went with him to India.

Xavier hoped that many of the Japanese might be induced to go to Goa and that the college in that city would fit them to return as evangelists to their own people. He wrote to some of the Jesuits:

"Do your best at the college to instruct and train the Chinese and Japanese boys, above all watching over their souls. Let them learn to read, write, and speak Portuguese so that they may be interpreters for the Fathers who, if it so pleases God, shall before many years come to Japan and China. It does not seem to me that there can be any other land yet discovered where so much fruit will be garnered as in this, nor that the Society can be elsewhere so perpetuated as in China and Japan......

Should there come to Goa two bonzes who go this year to Malacca, do all you can to have them welcomed into the houses of the Portuguese. Show them much attention. Manifest to them as much love as I did to Paul when I was in Goa, This is a people which wishes to be led only by love; therefore put away all severity in dealing with the Japanese."

Another letter stated that the bonzes would be accompanied by several other persons. Xavier also informed the Commandant of Malacca that many Japanese were on the way thither, being influenced by Paul's praise of the Europeans, and he added: "Take care that they be received in the houses of rich Portuguese where there shall be nothing lacking in what makes up honourable hospitality, so that the Japanese may return to confirm concerning the Portuguese all the good that Paul has been able to report."

A letter written June 24, 1550, by Father Perez, who was then in Malacca, tells us that the ship bearing the first news from Xavier had arrived in April. It further says:

"In the ship came four Japanese. They were well received in the house of a Chinese Christian; and many of the Portuguese of the city frequently invited them to their houses. They often came to see us also, and we instructed them in the doctrines of our holy faith, so that they gladly received baptism on Ascension Day. . . . Three of the new Christians have returned to Japan; the fourth remains here."

When Xavier had been two months in Kagoshima, he learned that a Portuguese ship had come from China to Hirado, a port in the northwestern part of Kyushu. Although he was suffering from a fever, he set out at once for that city, accompanied by a young Japanese who served as an interpreter. After about a month's absence he returned to Kagoshima.\* Here he resumed his former method of teaching. One of the first Japanese believers admitted to the priesthood afterwards wrote that he had been informed by the Christians of Kagoshima that when Xavier was there he "went twice a day to the terrace in front of a Buddhist monastery and there taught the people by reading to them from a book he had prepared."

Xavier frequently visited the monasteries themselves. The abbot of one belonging to the Zen sect was, according to Xavier, named Ninjit. He became very friendly with the missionary and often discussed religious questions with him. This bonze did not have a very high opinion of his associates, for when Xavier once found the monks engaged in the ceremony of meditation as practised by the Zen sect and asked what they were doing, Ninjit replied: "Some are reckoning up how much money they have gained from their parishioners, others are trying to think how they can manage to dress well and have good food, while the rest are thinking of the pleasures in which they wish to engage. Not one thinks upon any matter of importance."

Though Xavier writes that Ninjit was then eighty years old, he was still alive twelve or thirteen years later when Kagoshima was visited by Brother Almeida, to whom he said: "I wished to know all that Father Francis came to preach in Japan; but, for lack of an interpreter, I was not able to understand. Though I should like to be baptised before I die, my position, my dignity, and the veneration in which I am held prevent me. "Afterwards he and the abbot of another temple, who had also known Xavier, asked to be baptised in secret; but Almeida refused to grant their request.

In September, 1550, the three missionaries, accompanied by Amador, Manuel, and Bernard, left Kagoshima and went to Hirado, The reason, as given by Xavier, was the opposition to their work shown by the Buddhist priests, who urged the Daimyo to put a stop to the teaching of doctrines that would turn the people from their former beliefs. The "History of the Japanese Church"\* written at Macao in 1634, says the bonzes saw that the progress of the Gospel would cause the ruin of their monasteries, and so they decided to drive away the missionaries. They told the people not to listen to the foreigners, and circulated various rumours concerning them, such as that they ate human flesh. To increase suspicion, they threw blood-stained rags about the house occupied by the missionaries. The bonzes succeeded in getting the Daimyo to issue an edict forbidding under penalty of death that any one should in future become a Christian. He did not, however, persecute those that had already received baptism. Father Valegnani and the author of the history just mentioned say that the Daimyo became less favourable to the missionaries when he found that he could not make them his instruments for inducing the Portuguese ships to come to Kagoshima instead of to Hirado.

Anjiro was left to care for the little company of about one hundred and fifty baptised persons in Kagoshima. Five months after the departure of the missionaries, he was so persecuted by the bonzes that he fled to China. Sad to relate, this first Japanese convert and evangelist proved to be like many after him whose course has been a disappointment to their teachers. "Driven by misfortune," says Froez, "he became a *bafan* along the coasts of China. A *bafan* is nothing more nor less than a pirate who joins to deeds of violence at sea similar deeds on shore, thus inflicting loss upon fishermen and other people that live there. He was slain while engaged in one of these piratical expeditions."\*

On the way to Hirado Xavier stopped twelve days at the castle of Ichiku. Very likely it was not the first time he had been there. A retainer of its commandant had already been baptised under the name of Michael; and it was probably on the present visit that the commandant's wife, his eldest son, who was then about five years old, and several of his vassals were baptised. Froez tells us that before Xavier continued on his journey Michael asked that something efficacious for the healing of disease be given him, as the country was without physicians and medicines, Xavier therefore presented him with an image of Mary and a scourge. In giving him the image Xavier said: "My son Michael, here is a medicine for souls. Adore the image of the Holy Virgin, and when you wish to obtain forgiveness for your sins, kneel before it and ask Our Lady to obtain pardon through her Divine Son. "In presenting the scourge, he said: "This, my son Michael, is for the health of your body. If any one, Christian or pagan, suffers from fever, you must give him or he must give himself three light blows with this scourge, while he invokes the very sacred names of Jesus and Mary. In this way the sick will be healed. "During the remaining fourteen or fifteen years of Michael's life invalids were constantly coming to him from different parts of the country, being drawn by reports of the benefits that others had received from the remedy. Michael was so careful to observe Xavier's directions that he would never allow more than the prescribed number of blows to be given, asserting that otherwise the disease would be augmented.

Xavier taught Michael how to baptise infants and adults. He also gave him manuscripts in Japanese which contained a life of Christ, the Seven Penitential Psalms, some prayers, and a calendar. He told the Christians to meet on Sundays and feast-days that they might read the life of Christ and engage in worship; while on Fridays they were to repeat the Penitential Psalms. For amulets he gave them some little silk bags, each of which contained either the Creed or the names of Jesus and Mary.

Twelve years later, when Almeida visited Ichiku, he found that Michael was the leader of a company of Christians numbering about seventy. He still kept the scourge and told how by its use the wife of the commandant had been healed of a severe ailment. Every week the Christians of the castle held a meeting in which each gave himself three blows with the scourge. The commandant had not been baptised. He said to Almeida: "Had I not been convinced that your religion is true, I should not have allowed my wife and children to accept it, I adore no God but the One worshipped by you and in all my needs I look to Him for help. Out of regard for the Daimyo I do not yet announce my faith; but I hope that hereafter God wilt make it possible for me to do so and that I shall have my lord's permission to declare myself a Christian."

On reaching Hirado the missionaries were saluted with a salvo of artillery from the Portuguese ships that were lying in the harbour. They were also furnished with an escort of honour when they went to meet the Daimyo. In one of Xavier's letters he wrote concerning Hirado: "The lord of that country received us with much affection and kindness. In a few days about a hundred persons became Christians, thanks to what was preached to them by Brother Juan Fernandez, who already knew how to speak passably well, and to the book translated into the Japanese language, which we read to them."

Xavier remained in Hirado only ten days. He desired to push on towards Kyoto, where he hoped to effect the conversion of the Emperor. Leaving Cosmo Torres and the two servants in Hirado, he with Fernandez and Bernard continued their journey. They went most *of* the way on foot, their shoulders laden with the few things they needed to take with them. Many were the difficulties that they met. Sometimes they were refused shelter at the inns. In many places they were rudely treated by the people. The children hooted at them and pelted them with stones.

Fernandez says that while in Kagoshima the missionaries had been reproved by the bonzes for eating meat and fish; therefore on this journey, when these articles of diet were served at the inns, Xavier would explain to those who might be about him that it was perfectly proper to use such things, which God had supplied for the needs of men; but after taking a very small piece in order to enforce his words by his example, he made his meal entirely of rice and vegetables.\*

At Hakata the missionaries visited a large temple of the Zen sect, whose priests received them with great pleasure as persons who had come from India, the cradle of Buddhism. Before leaving them, Xavier, as we are told by Fernandez, reproved the abbot and priests in the severest terms for the abominable vice of sodomy which prevailed among them. He also reproached them because on the one hand they told the people that there was no future life and on the other exhorted them to bring in behalf of their dead friends offerings which the bonzes used for their own benefit. His hearers were astonished that a stranger should reprimand them so vigorously, though some of them only laughed at his words.

In a few days the travellers reached Yamaguchi, a city in the southwestern part of the largest of the Japanese islands. Here they met the Daimyo, who, after asking many questions about India and Europe, expressed a desire to know the nature of the religion they had come to teach. Accordingly Fernandez read from their book the account of the Creation and an explanation of the Commandments. When the Daimyo heard the condemnation of sodomy, a vice to which he himself was addicted, his countenance showed that he was much excited, and the officer who had arranged for the interview made a sign to the missionaries that they should withdraw: "As for me," wrote Fernandez, "I was afraid that the King would have our heads cut off."

"The next day," continues Fernandez, "without waiting for any order or permission of the King, Father Francis decided that we should preach in the streets of Yamaguchi. This we did in the following manner. We stood at the crossings where the people were abundant. I first read from the book an account of the creation of the world. Then in a loud voice I spoke of the great sins committed by the Japanese, dwelling principally on three things: First they forgot God, the Creator and the all-powerful One, who made and preserves them. Instead of Him they adored wood, stone, and inanimate things, through them worshipping the devil, who is the enemy of God and men. In the second place, they give themselves up to the abominations of Sodom; and at this point I exposed the shame and baseness of sin, speaking of the chastisements with which the world has been afflicted because of it. The third sin was that of the women, who, to spare themselves the trouble of bringing up children, slay their offspring at birth or even before, an act that proves them guilty of horrible cruelty and inhumanity. While I was thus preaching, Father Francis at my side engaged in prayer, asking God to bless my words to those that listened.

"Thus we continued preaching every day until there did not remain in that great city a street-crossing where we had not made public addresses. We also spoke in the house of gentlemen *\[fidalgos\]* who invited us, some of them for the sake of killing time, some because they wished to hear something new, and others that they might make fun of us. Some showed us either affection or pity, while others gave evident signs of despising us. Among these gentlemen was one who had, as I think, brought us to his house only for his amusement or pastime. While I was reading to him the story of the fall of the angels, how Lucifer for his pride was cast down from heaven to hell, and how those that are haughty will meet a like fate, since they will be delivered up to the demons with whom they must suffer eternal punishment, he began to show his contempt for what I was reading. Father Francis at once chided him, saying: 'However powerful you may be, if you do not humble yourself and weep for your sins, God will know how to subdue you by the torments of hell.' As the man drew nearer to us expressing his scorn for the Father and his words, Father Francis was inflamed with zeal and his face was all aglow as he said: 'Beware\! unless you humble yourself, you will suffer these torments.' Thereupon we left him. As we were going from his house the Father said to me: ' I am sorry for that gentleman. The more powerful these persons are, the less they profit from God's mercies.'"

It is evident that no fear of consequences held Xavier back from speaking plainly to his hearers. Moreover, when he was aware that men of high rank were using impolite forms of speech towards him, he told Fernandez: "Thee-and-thou them just as they do me."\* Fernandez says that in obeying this direction he always trembled lest his head would be struck off, but Xavier reproved him, saying that, in order to gain the respect of the Japanese, they must show that they had no fear of death.

Xavier wrote as follows of the way they were ridiculed by the rabble:

"Whenever we went through the streets of the city, we were followed by a company of boys drawn from the lowest dregs of the populace who laughed at us and mocked us with such words as: 'There go the men who tell us that we must embrace the law of God in order to be saved, because we cannot be rescued from destruction except by the Maker of all things and by His Son\! There go the men who declare that it is wicked to have more than one wife."

The missionaries remained about two months in Yamaguchi and then finding, as Xavier writes, that the results of their labour were small, they started the last of December on their way towards Kyoto. The weather seemed very severe to persons that had lived in India and had spent the previous winter in the comparatively mild climate of Kagoshima. Sometimes they had to ford rivers where the icy water was waist-deep. They were ignorant of the roads, and the country was in a confused state owing to the civil wars. In one place through which they passed, an influential man who became interested in the travellers gave them a letter to a friend in the city of Sakai asking him to help them on their way. When they presented this letter, the person to whom it was addressed entertained them hospitably and made arrangements by which they joined the train of a nobleman who was on his way to the capital, now only about forty miles distant. It was a great advantage to be in such a company, since it afforded them protection from evil-disposed persons along the road.

Xavier and his companions reached Kyoto in January, a month when the winds, sweeping down from snow-covered mountains north of the city, are cold and piercing. Five years previously, war and conflagrations had made a large part of the city almost a desert. There had been a succession of civil strifes, in which the warlike monks of Mt. Hiei had taken an active part. The court-nobles and many other inhabitants had moved elsewhere. The missionaries had a letter to a gentleman who sent them to the residence of his son-in-law, eighteen or twenty leagues distant.\* From there they soon returned to Kyoto where Xavier tried to obtain an audience with the Mikado. Those to whom he applied asked whether he had brought any presents. He answered that these had been left in Hirado, whence they could quickly be procured if permission was given him to present them in person to the Mikado. This reply was not deemed satisfactory, and it may be doubted whether in any case an audience could have been procured. Xavier became convinced that the most powerful person in Japan at that time was the Lord of Yamaguchi. Since there seemed to be little hope of accomplishing anything in the capital, he departed after having spent only eleven days in the city.

Such is the account given by Fernandez. Xavier himself wrote:

"Arriving in Meaco, we passed some days making an attempt to have an interview with the King in order to demand permission to publish the Divine Law in his kingdom; but in this we failed, and since we did not find among the people any disposition to listen to the proclamation of the Gospel, wars or other obstacles standing in the way, we returned to Yamaguchi."

Retracing their way to Sakai, Xavier and his companions went from there to Hirado by sea. They found that in the four months of their absence a number of persons had been baptised by Torres, who was now left to continue his work while the others soon set out again for Yamaguchi. Increased acquaintance with the Japanese had shown Xavier that both the rich and the poor were inclined to despise a person that was not well dressed. He therefore abandoned the garb of poverty and procured from the Portuguese merchants richer garments than he had hitherto worn. He took with him the letters and presents that had been furnished by the Viceroy of India and the Bishop of Goa. These would have gone to either the Mikado or the Shogun if circumstances had been more favourable in Kyoto. As it was, they were given to the Lord of Yamaguchi, who in return sent a large sum of silver to Xavier. The latter at once returned this, saying that a more acceptable gift would be permission to preach the Gospel.

Xavier also gave the Daimyo a large and beautifully bound copy of the Bible, telling him that in this book was written the whole of the Sacred Law that the missionaries had come to proclaim. Verbal permission for teaching was at once granted, and four months later public notices were posted throughout the city proclaiming that the missionaries were at liberty to preach Christianity and the people to believe it. Moreover, the Daimyo presented the missionaries with a piece of land that had belonged to a Buddhist monastery.

At the Daimyo's residence Xavier met several Buddhist priests belonging to the Shingon sect. As they listened to his explanation of the attributes of God, they professed to find a great resemblance between his views and what they themselves taught concerning Dainichi, that one of the so-called Buddhist Trinity who is the personification of wisdom and purity. They said to him: "We differ in language and customs, but in reality the law taught by you and by us is one and the same. "They invited him to their temples and in other ways showed themselves very friendly, apparently hoping to profit by the favour which he enjoyed with the Daimyo. Xavier set himself to learn what he could about this Dainichi. Froez says:

"In frequent conversations with the bonzes he sounded their beliefs so far as his slight acquaintance with the language enabled him to do so. He especially asked them about the three divine Persons and the relations that existed between them, about the incarnation of the Second Person, and about the mystery of redemption through the Cross. The bonzes had no knowledge at all of such doctrines and ridiculed them as fables. On discovering this and also learning their abominable practices, Xavier recognized that their specious doctrines and the words in which these were disguised were the work of the devil. He ordered Juan Fernandez to preach through the streets that men ought not to adore Dainichi nor to consider him as a god; that, on the contrary, they should recognise that the teaching of the Shingon sect, like that of the others, was only an invention of devils and a tissue of falsehoods."

It is not strange that Xavier soon ceased to be a welcome guest at the temples nor that the bonzes did their best to counteract his influence.

In accordance with the permission that had been granted for the public proclamation of Christianity, Xavier was accustomed to go out twice a day for this purpose. Standing at a street-corner or sitting on the curb of the public well, he would read from his book and endeavour to explain its meaning to the people that gathered about him. Most of the preaching, however, was done by Fernandez. Though many persons were ready to praise the new doctrine, none were willing to become its adherents until after the occurrence of an incident that brought about the first conversion. As Fernandez was speaking to a large company of people, a man edged his way through the crowd and, pretending that he was about to whisper something in the preacher's ear, bent forward and spat upon his cheek. The crowd laughed at this exploit and looked to see how the foreigner would treat such an insult. With admirable self-control Fernandez, without pausing in his address or even turning to look at his assailant, quietly wiped his face with a handkerchief and went on as calmly as though nothing unusual had occurred. The spectators were greatly impressed. One prominent man who had been an avowed enemy of Christianity reasoned thus to himself: "A religion that enables its followers to practise such virtue must surely be divine. "At the close of the sermon he followed Fernandez home and declared that the words and the behaviour of the preacher had convinced him of the truth of Christianity. He was the first in the city to be baptised, and his example had a great influence upon others.

It was in Yamaguchi that Xavier is said by his biographers to have made a remarkable exhibition of miraculous powers:

"As he was often surrounded by many who hoped to puzzle him by their incessant and contradictory questions—such as the essence of the deity, the creation of the world, the secrets of nature, the malice of the devils, the immortality of the soul, the eternity of rewards and punishments; others again were questions of mere curiosity as to the motion of the heavenly bodies, the causes of eclipses, thunder, lightning, the rainbow, and other equally dissimilar subjects—he with one and the same answer solved these multifarious doubts, God so transforming the words, either in his mouth or in the ears of his auditors, that each one seemed to hear the answer required by his own special question."\*

Those that credit such marvels will not be surprised to learn that "in after years, when other missionaries succeeded him in Japan, the people complained that they did not answer questions as immediately as the first teacher of Christianity they had seen."†

Though Xavier's letters narrate no such wonders, they do speak of the many questions that were addressed to him. In asking for new missionaries he says:

"They will be annoyed more than can well be imagined. At all hours of the day and into the night they will be beset with visits and questions. They will be invited to prominent houses where no excuse can be found for staying away. They will have no time for prayer or thought or meditation. In the beginning especially, they will not be able to say daily mass. The answering of questions will occupy so much of their time that they will hardly find leisure for reciting the office, for eating, or for sleeping,"

The missionaries were much encouraged by their success in Yamaguchi. Xavier wrote: "In two months, at least five hundred persons have become Christians and the number is daily increasing. "Among the early converts was a young man, totally blind in one eye and having but little use of the other, who made a living as a story-teller and musician. He is said to have had a keen mind, as was shown by the kind of questions he addressed to the missionaries. Convinced by their answers, he was baptised and received the name of Lawrence. This man was afterwards admitted into the Society of Jesus as a lay brother. He became a very effective worker and in the remaining thirty years of his life was the means of procuring many conversions.

A report having reached Xavier that a Portuguese vessel had come to the province of Bungo on the east coast of Kyushu, he sent on the first of September, 1551, to get information concerning it. The messenger brought back letters from the Portuguese merchants and also one from Otomo Yoshishige, the Lord of Bungo, asking him to come to Funai, his capital. This daimyo, then only twenty-three years old, was to have an important place in the history of the Japanese Church, One of the first, perhaps the very first foreign ship to visit Japan had come to Bungo nine or ten years before, and it is said that his entreaties were what prevented its confiscation by his father. This made the youth very popular with the Portuguese. One of those who came on that ship remained three years in Bungo and taught him many things about Europe. When the young man became Daimyo, he did his best to attract merchants to his ports, recognising the great advantages that would come from foreign trade. It seems probable that the letter which had come to Malacca two years before asking for missionaries was from Yoshishige.

Xavier summoned Torres to come to Yamaguchi, while he himself set out for Bungo accompanied by Bernard and three other Christians. They were enthusiastically welcomed by the Daimyo and the Portuguese. Among the latter was the famous Mendez Pinto, who describes the ceremonies connected with Xavier's introduction to the Daimyo, besides recounting many other incidents alleged to have occurred during the stay in Bungo. Among other things he gives a full report of a discussion that Xavier is said to have had with a famous Buddhist priest. Unfortunately it is impossible to put much reliance on this and other improbable stories narrated by Pinto in connection with this visit.

Xavier accepted the invitation of the Portuguese captain to take passage with him to India. Affairs connected with the Society's work in that country are said to have made his presence desirable; but in his own letter the only reasons given for the decision to return are that he desired to meet the associates from whom he had been so long separated, to find new workers for Japan, and to provide many things that were needed by the labourers there. In the same letter he speaks of his decision to attempt work in China. He had met many Chinese in Japan and considered them as belonging to a superior race. Moreover, the relations of the two countries were such that he thought the acceptance of Christianity by the Chinese would ensure its victory in Japan.

The ship sailed from Bungo November 20, 1551. Xavier therefore had spent twenty-seven months in Japan. He was accompanied on the return voyage by Bernard and another convert named Matthew. The latter died the next year in Goa. Bernard proceeded to Europe, was admitted as a lay brother to the Society of Jesus, and died a few years later in its college at Coimbra, Portugal.

The Lord of Bungo sent by the same ship an envoy to the Viceroy of India asking for an alliance with the Portuguese. He also requested that more missionaries be sent to teach his people and said: "They will reside at Funai near me, and I will show them greater favour than the other kings of Japan possibly can. "The envoy became a Christian while on the voyage. The next year he returned to Japan.

After reaching India, Xavier busied himself over matters connected with the conduct of the Society, selected missionaries to be sent to Japan, and made arrangements for his own journey to China. Setting out at last for the latter country, he in due time reached Chang-chuang \(Sanchian\), an island which was at that time the place for trade between the Chinese and the Portuguese. It was his hope that some of the native merchants might be induced to convey him secretly to the mainland. The Portuguese, who feared that such an attempt might lead the Chinese to withdraw permission for trade, tried to dissuade him from his purpose. While trying to surmount the obstacles they put in his way, he was struck down with fever and died November 27, 1552.\*

The accounts given by the Jesuits assert that Xavier's coffin was filled with quicklime in order that the flesh might be quickly consumed, leaving the bones to be taken to India; but in February, when the coffin was opened, it was found that the body and even the clothes remained intact. When a slight cut was made in the flesh, the blood flowed freely. The body was taken to Malacca and ultimately to Goa. It is affirmed that many miracles have been wrought in connection with it. At Goa, every twelfth year, there is a great festival at which the faithful are allowed to gaze on the hands and feet of the saint. Those who saw the body in 1890 said that it no longer retained the fresh appearance it formerly had, but that the skin had become dry like that of a mummy. One Roman Catholic missionary in India, in endeavouring to account for the change, wrote: "It is my humble opinion that the desiccation of the holy relic began at the moment when the Jesuits were expelled from Goa."†

Whatever we may think of these stories and of the reverence shown for the body, we must recognise that Xavier yet lives through the influence that he has exerted upon his own church and to some extent upon others. He did more perhaps than any other man of modern times to arouse the missionary zeal of Roman Catholics. He was indeed far from being a model missionary. He did not exhibit that persistence in one line of effort that is needed to secure the best results. In India, lie relied too much on the power of the government for advancing the interests of religion. He even desired to have a military expedition sent to aid a person who promised to be a Christian if he were set up as a native ruler. Having obtained authority over the pearl fisheries at Tutocorin, Xavier ordered that certain persons should not be allowed to share in them because they had been so disobedient to him that they deserved the name of renegades. He urged the King of Portugal to set up the Inquisition in India.\* Such facts show that had he remained in Japan he would doubtless have approved the methods by which afterwards some of the converted daimyos forced their subjects to accept Christianity. All of this, however, is little more than to say that in such matters Xavier was a man of his own age. We must not judge even the progressive men of the past by the standards of to-day. We cannot expect them to surpass their contemporaries in every particular. If some of Xavier's methods, such as the speedy baptism of multitudes who knew hardly anything of the real meaning of Christianity, seem to us unwise, we must remember that he was treading unbeaten paths. They that undertake a new work must frequently make mistakes. They cannot profit by the experiences of others. In missionary methods men of the present day ought to he wiser than those that have gone before them.

Whatever may have been Xavier's faults, he was fitted to be a leader of men. He was a pioneer who, like Livingstone, opened the way for others. An enthusiast himself, he was able to inspire his followers with enthusiasm. There was in him something that to a wonderful degree called out the love of those who came under his influence, making them willing to work or to suffer with him and for him. Many whose religious views differ greatly from his can sympathise with his earnest devotion to Christ; Romanists, Protestants, and Eastern Christians alike finding in the hymn which is ascribed to Xavier an expression of their own deepest thoughts:
> "O God Thou art the object of my love,  
Not for the hopes of endless joys above.  
Not for the fear of endless pains below  
Which those who love Thee not must undergo.  
For me and such as me Thou once didst bear  
The ignominious cross, the nails, the spear;  
A thorny crown transpierced Thy sacred brow;  
What bloody sweats from every member flow\!  
For me in torture Thou resign'dst Thy breath,  
Nailed to the cross, and sav'dst me by Thy death.  
Say, can those sufferings fail my heart to move?  
What but Thyself can now deserve my love?  
Such as then was and is Thy love to me,  
Such is, and shall be still, my love to Thee.  
Thy love, O Jesus, may I ever sing,  
O God of love, kind Parent, dearest King."> \(Translated by Dryden.\)\*

It seems strange that Xavier himself does not speak of it in the long letter dated November 5, 1549, which contains the account of the voyage to Japan and the early experiences in Kagoshima. However, there are other omissions that are equally inexplicable. Xavier does not tell us how he found opportunity to forward this and other letters of the same date. Father Cros, extending somewhat the "two months" at Kagoshima, supposes that the letter, which was evidently written by piecemeal was finished and dated just before Xavier set out for Hirado and that the four Japanese who were to go in the Portuguese ship to Malacca followed him more slowly. Another question to which we find no answer is why Xavier delayed so long in carrying out his desire to go to Kyoto. To say nothing of the possibility of going by land, as he finally did, the more than a year spent in Kagoshima must have brought a favourable season for navigation.

### WORK OF THE EARLY MISSIONARIES 1551-1570



WHILE Xavier was in Bungo he received letters from Torres and Fernandez telling him of events in Yamaguchi. Immediately after his departure from that city the bonzes forced their way into the house where the missionaries dwelt, and began to make sport of them and their teachings. There also came for several successive days a number of the gentlemen and scholars of the city to propound various questions concerning the Christian religion. Fernandez sent to Xavier a list of these queries and of the answers that Torres made through him as interpreter. The questions were as follows:—

Of what material did God create human souls?

What is the shape of the soul, and what is its colour?

If the soul is without colour, is it then nothing at all?

What is God and where is He?

Has God a body?

When the soul leaves the body, does it see God?

Why cannot a man see God?

If the soul is not corporeal, is it God?

What are devils?

Why do devils cause so much evil to men?

It is not true that all which God created is good; for did He not create that proud and rebellious spirit, Lucifer?

If God desires the salvation of men, why does He permit the devil to do them so much evil?

If God wishes to save men, why has He made them so that they seem to be set upon doing or desiring evil?

If God wishes that all men should attain to glory, why has He made the road to its attainment so difficult?

As hell is in the center of the earth, then, when the devils come to tempt us, do they escape from their torments?

If, as you say, the devils are in torment wherever they are, why was a special place created for punishing them?

By what road can devils come to us from the center of the earth?

If God wishes to save men, why has He been so slow in giving us a knowledge of His Law?

There are some men so devoid of intelligence that they cannot attain to a knowledge of their Creator. What will become of such persons?

The Buddhist priests did their best to excite the people against the missionaries. Many were the stories that they invented for this purpose. Among other things they declared that they had seen a demon causing lightning to fall upon the Daimyo's mansion because of his relations with foreigners.

A civil strife that broke out at the end of September, 1551, though it had no direct connection with religious matters, increased the danger of the missionaries' position. A revolt was raised against the Daimyo, who, after an attempt at flight, committed suicide. For eight days the city was a scene of confusion and bloodshed. At the beginning of the trouble an influential gentleman of the city invited the foreigners to take shelter in his house. On the way thither they met several armed bands and heard people shouting: "Let us slay those men from India, since they are the cause of the evils that have come upon us. "Their protector decided that they would be safer in a Buddhist monastery to whose funds he was a leading contributor. He accordingly sent them thither, and though the bonzes were at first inclined to refuse them admittance, saying: "You are devils and it is you who have brought all these calamities upon the land," they finally yielded and gave them shelter for two days. After this, the missionaries returned to the house of their protector, who concealed them until danger was over.

Those who had brought about the revolution now persuaded the brother of Otomo Yoshishige to take the place of the daimyo against whom they had rebelled. The new ruler, like his brother, was friendly to foreigners. Xavier in one of his letters says:

"Before I left Japan, the King of Bungo promised the Portuguese and myself that he would omit nothing which would induce his brother, the King of Yamaguchi, to treat Father Torres and Brother Fernandez with all favour; and the King of Yamaguchi, who had hardly entered into possession of his estates, promised for himself that he would do this."

As one result of this latter promise, a Buddhist monastery in Yamaguchi was soon afterwards given to the missionaries. The deed, of which a facsimile has been preserved, was to the following effect:

"With respect to Daijoji in Yamaguchi, Agata, Yoshiki Department, Province of Suwo. This deed witnesses that I have given permission to the priests that have come to this country from the western regions, in accordance with their request and desire that they may found a monastery and house in order to develop the law of Buddha."\*

After his return to India, Xavier sent Father Balthazar Gago, together with Brothers Edward de Sylva and Peter d'Alcaceva to reinforce the mission in Japan. They reached Kagoshima in August, 1552, and proceeded to Funai, where they delivered the letters and presents that had been sent to Yoshishige by the Viceroy of India, On learning of their arrival, Torres sent Fernandez to act as their interpreter and to accompany them to Yamaguchi. The next Christmas was celebrated in that city with great pomp, and several persons who had become converts were invited to meet with the missionaries for a conference. Among other results of their deliberations was a decision that the Christians should engage in works of charity. One reason for doing this was to disprove the charge made by the Buddhist priests, who said that those who became Christians were influenced by the desire to escape from the necessity of making contributions to the temples. It was therefore ordered that a box for the reception of alms be placed at the entrance of the building that was used for worship. The administration of the contributions was assigned to men whose rank and probity made them honoured by the people of the city.

Soon after this meeting, Gago and Fernandez went to reside in Funai; Sylva and Lawrence remained in Yamaguchi to assist Torres; while Alcaceva, bearing letters and presents from the Daimyo of Bungo to the Viceroy of India, soon returned to Goa in order to report the state of affairs in Japan and to ask for more missionaries.

For some time Funai and Yamaguchi remained the centres of Christian work. Naito, the Governor of Yamaguchi, was among those that early received baptism. His example was followed by many other prominent persons. Two Buddhist priests of Kyoto, moved by curiosity to see the foreigners and by a desire to enter into a discussion with them, came to Yamaguchi, One day, while Father Torres was addressing the people, these priests began to ask questions. The missionary replied and then continued his discourse, in which he had occasion to refer to the Apostle Paul. "Who is this Paul of whom you speak?" asked one of the priests. Thereupon Torres gave an extended account of the Apostle's life. Hardly had he finished when the questioner called out: "I, too, will be a Christian. As I have hitherto imitated Saul the persecutor, I desire henceforth to be like Paul the Apostle. "His companion also declared his decision to be a Christian. The two men were soon baptised and received the names Paul and Barnabas. Both became earnest evangelists, going about the neighbouring towns and villages in order to proclaim their new faith.

In Funai the Buddhist priests, after vain attempts to make the people believe their calumnies against the missionaries, began to claim that Christianity differed from Buddhism only in certain external matters that were of little importance. The missionaries set themselves earnestly to the task of disproving such assertions by showing the radical differences between the two religions. A revolt that arose against Otomo Yoshishige was thought to have been instigated by the Buddhists, and it threatened to interfere seriously with the progress of Christianity. The Daimyo was besieged in one of his strongholds. lie did not know whom he could trust or what was the real strength of the opposition against him. Fernandez at considerable risk made his way to the castle, where he was able to report the real state of affairs. This act, together with the loyalty of the Christians, increased the favour with which Yoshishige regarded the missionaries.

Another revolt at Yamaguchi proved disastrous to Yoshishige's brother and to the church in that city. The number of converts there had reached about two thousand in the year 1556, when the opponents of the new Daimyo attacked the city and set it on fire. Three weeks later, it was reported that the enemy was approaching for another attack. The converts persuaded Torres, the only missionary then in Yamaguchi, to take refuge in Bungo. Soon after this, the Daimyo was slain, Many of the Christians lost their lives. For the next eighteen years the church of Yamaguchi was left without any resident priest, and it never again attained that degree of prosperity that its early history seemed to promise.

Alcaceva's efforts in India to obtain more missionaries for Japan were successful. Even the Provincial of the Jesuits, Melchior Nugnez, decided to be one of the number. He was helped to this decision by a conversation with Mendez Pinto, who, in telling him about Xavier's work in Japan, exclaimed: "Father Nugnez, you are the man who ought to go to that country. Gladly would I accompany you thither. How happy should I be if God graciously permitted me to give my life for the glory of His holy name\!" The Provincial, who doubted whether Pinto was in earnest, began to speak of some objections. Pinto declared that his desire to go was so great that no difficulties could hold him back. Moreover, he announced that, after sending some gifts to relatives in Portugal, he would devote the rest of his fortune to the expenses of the proposed expedition to Japan and to the establishment of a seminary in Yamaguchi, This enthusiasm was so contagious that Nugnez, after consulting his associates and the Viceroy, decided that it was his duty to go to Japan with Pinto, who was now appointed the Viceroy's ambassador to the Daimyo—or King, as the Portuguese considered him—of Bungo.\* With them went Father Gaspar Vilela and some seminarists. They set sail early in 1554, but were obliged to winter in Malacca, The next year, unfavourable winds detained them in China, where Nugnez received a letter from Loyola saying that a provincial ought not to go to regions so distant that he could not quickly return to his appointed place. Letters also came from Goa urging him to come back, lie was about to follow these injunctions when a Portuguese merchant came from Japan with reports that again inflamed his zeal. Moreover, he received a letter from the Daimyo of Hirado, who had heard that Nugnez was on his way to Japan and therefore urged him to come to that city. The Daimyo doubtless thought that the residence there of the Provincial would help to draw the Portuguese merchants. In asking Nugnez to come to him, he referred to the previous visits of Xavier and other missionaries, saying that many of his leading retainers, as well as some members of his own family, had been baptised, and he declared that he himself was almost ready to become a Christian.

Nugnez decided to go forward. The winds were such that, instead of proceeding to Hirado, the captain found it advisable to land on the coast of Bungo, which they reached in July, 1556. The missionaries were received with great honour by Yoshishige. Using Fernandez as interpreter, Nugnez had a long interview with this lord, who declared that he was convinced of the truth of Christianity. When he was urged to receive baptism and thus make a public declaration of his faith, he said that this was for the time being impossible, as there were in his domains many rebellious spirits who would take advantage of such action on his part and would join the Buddhist priests in seeking his overthrow.

Illness prevented Nugnez from going to Hirado and necessitated his speedy return to India. Before his departure he admitted to the Society of Jesuits two of the seminarists that had accompanied him to Japan, and also Louis Almeida, a Portuguese gentleman about thirty years of age, who had come to India and afterwards to Japan, hoping that by trade or by the practice of medicine, which he had studied, he might be able to repair his damaged fortunes. Just as he was about to return to Portugal, Father Gago had persuaded him to undertake the Spiritual Exercises of Loyola, and as a result of this he decided to give himself wholly to the service of God. Before his admission to the Society, he devoted five thousand crowns, which he had brought with him for trade, to the establishment at Funai of a hospital for lepers and of an asylum for children whose parents were too poor to provide for their support. He was led to found this asylum because he learned that the Japanese women often killed their new-born babes in order to avoid the expense of rearing them. The Daimyo, to whom Almeida appealed for help against this iniquitous custom, promised to provide nurses to care for the children\* Almeida was the first of the noble line of medical missionaries in Japan. The reputation that he gained for his skill in healing disease, the charity that he manifested for those in poverty or distress, and his indefatigable efforts for the spread of the Gospel, made him one of the most successful of the Jesuit labourers.

The persistency with which the Daimyo of Hirado continued to ask for missionaries inspired the hope that he might be more ready than Yoshishige to become an open adherent of Christianity. Early in 1557, Gago, Fernandez, and Paul, the converted Buddhist priest, were sent to Hirado by Torres, whom Nugnez had made Superior. Although they did not find the Daimyo in so teachable a state of mind as they had hoped, the favourable reception that he gave them opened the way by which they were able to attain much success among his subjects. One of the early converts was Koteda Saemonnojo, a brother of the Daimyo, and acting under him as ruler of two neighbouring islands named Takashima and Ikutsukishima. At baptism he took the name Anthony. Under the designation "Prince Anthony" he occupies a prominent place in the letters and reports of the Jesuits, From the first he was very zealous in seeking the conversion of his own subjects. At his invitation the missionaries visited the islands. "The Prince's example drew abundance after it, and his zeal more; for he changed from a prince into an apostle by exhorting his people himself to leave their superstition, and standing godfather to all that would receive holy baptism. He had no greater pleasure in the world than to see them pull down idols out of the temples and houses, and burn, and throw them into the sea."\*

With such encouragement it is not strange that adherents to the new religion increased so rapidly that in less than two months there were said to be fourteen hundred Christians in Anthony's estates. For their use he built several churches. In the absence of priests, the meetings held were chiefly for mutual encouragement and for the instruction of children. In the city of Hirado also there were many baptisms, and two churches were erected.

Ere long the number of workers was reduced by the illness of Paul. Feeling that he had not much longer to live, he begged to be taken back to Father Torres in order that he might receive the last sacrament from the same hand that had baptised him. This request was granted, and he died soon after reaching Funai.

Father Vilela was sent to take the place of Paul and of Gago, who had gone in 1557 to Hakata in Chikuzen, a province that had lately come into the possession of Otomo Yoshishige. Vilela was delighted with what he found in his new field of labour. It seemed to him that he had never seen so much religious fervour. All the neophytes, he said, were like catechists, trying to teach others what they themselves had learned. Vilela's own energy had much to do with this exhibition of zeal. He sent out one of the Brothers through the streets to ring a bell, chant prayers, and attract the children to church. The boys were organised in bands that paraded the streets singing Christian hymns, and they were told to repeat to their parents what was taught them in the church.

One morning the Christians were much excited to find that in the night a cross at whose foot they had been accustomed to pray had been removed. This was asserted to be the work of Buddhist priests, who had chosen three of their number to uproot the hated symbol of Christianity. As the story was afterwards told, speedy punishment fell upon those that had committed the sacrilege; for two of them at once fell into a quarrel that ended in their slaying each other, while the third mysteriously disappeared, nothing being heard of him until a demon that had taken possession of a young man confessed to being the spirit of the person who had thrown down the cross and who was now suffering punishment for the evil deed.

On seeing what had been done, the more impetuous of the believers set fire to a Buddhist monastery. They also dragged out the idols from a neighbouring temple, burning some of them and casting others into the sea. The priests hastened to the Daimyo, demanding not only that the Christians be punished, but that Vilela, the foreigner that was causing this trouble, should be driven out of the country. On the other hand, Anthony came to the defence of the missionary, asking if it was right to send away so summarily a religious teacher who had come at the Daimyo's own invitation, to whom protection had been promised, and who had committed no wrong. He declared that though the Daimyo's subjects had been forbidden to annoy the foreigners, the bonzes had circulated calumnies concerning them and had been the first movers in the present acts of violence.

The Daimyo replied by speaking of the difficult position in which he was placed. As the Daimyo of Bungo was about to make war upon him, it was imperative that there should be no division among his subjects; but the Buddhist priests were now threatening to stir up an insurrection. He urged that in view of the coming conflict it would be better for the missionary to withdraw, as he would be suspected of being an emissary of the Lord of Bungo. Moreover, a temporary withdrawal would be for the best interests of Christianity, since it would give an opportunity for the present excitement to cool down.

Convinced by these arguments, Anthony advised Vilela to leave the province for a while. At the same time a letter from Yoshishige urged the missionary to return to him. He accordingly set out at once for Funai, It is said that in his short stop at Hirado he had baptised thirteen hundred persons and converted three temples into Christian churches.

The believers in Hirado were now exposed to great trials, and it was from their number that the first Japanese martyr came. Another cross had been erected in the suburbs of the city. Thither processions of the Christians went every morning and evening, while at other times guards were stationed to preserve it from insult. Among the Christians was the maid-servant of an unbelieving master who said that he would kill her if she persisted in going to the cross for worship. Unhindered by his threats, she continued her devotions until one morning, as she was returning from the cross, she was met by her master, who drew his sword and cut off her head. The Christians took up the body and buried it with great solemnity, exhorting one another to imitate the woman's example by remaining faithful unto death.

It has been mentioned that shortly before Vilela went to Hirado, Gago had removed to Hakata, the chief city of Chikuzen. He was accompanied by Brother Perreyra, one of the young Portuguese whom Nugnez had recently admitted to the Society of Jesus. They had not been there very long when the city was besieged by its former possessors, who were striving to recover the territories that had been seized by Otomo Yoshishige. At first a vigorous defence was made, but it is said that the Buddhist priests, who were very averse to being under a lord favourable to Christianity, opened the gates to the enemy. Fernandez, who happened to be in Hakata at the beginning of the siege, had been sent away by Gago in charge of some Christian children that served as acolytes. The other two Jesuits and Sylvester, a Christian who had accompanied them from Hirado, escaped by night to a ship that was anchored about two leagues from the city. When the captain learned that Hakata had been taken and that the refugees were the preachers who had been sent by Yoshishige, he took from them the church ornaments and other things they had brought with them, at the same time threatening them with death. Sylvester was told that he was free to depart, but he refused to leave the missionaries. After four days the captain reported to the Governor of Hakata that he had the foreigners in his charge. A force of soldiers that was sent to take them over quarrelled with the captain concerning the plunder and stripped from the missionaries the few clothes that had been left them. On arriving at Hakata, the captives were kept for several days in a dungeon beneath the ramparts. A Christian of high rank finally obtained permission to take them under his care. He also paid money for the ransom of Gago and the children, as their attempt to escape had been unsuccessful. For three months the missionaries lived in daily expectation that orders would be given for their execution; but at the end of that time they were led outside of the city and told that they might depart. They reached Funai only a short time before the arrival of Vilela.

It was not long before the missionaries thus assembled at Funai began to scatter once more. Mention has already been made of Mt. Hiei, a stronghold of Buddhism in the vicinity of Kyoto. The head priest of one of its temples had sent a letter to Father Torres expressing an earnest desire to see him. The writer said that only his own great age kept him from making the journey to Bungo, and he hoped that Torres, who had travelled from the ends of the earth to preach his religion to the Japanese, would be willing to come to Mt. Hiei in order to instruct a person earnestly desirous to know the truth. Xavier in his letters had written much about what he called the three great universities of Japan— Mt. Hiei, Koya, and Ashikaga,—urging that missionaries should be sent who had the ability to cope with their learned men, secure their conversion, and thus gain their help in Christianising Japan. The priest's letter seemed to open the way for entrance to the first of these schools.

Torres, who was unable to go at that time, forwarded to the priest a written statement of the principal Christian doctrines, and soon after he sent Vilela to give further instruction. In company with Brother Lawrence and another Japanese Christian, Vilela went by sea to Sakai and thence by land to Sakamoto, a village on the shores of Lake Biwa and at the foot of Mt. Hiei. There he learned that the priest who had sent the letter to Torres was no longer living. His successor professed considerable interest in what he heard from Vilela and advised him to ascend the mountain in order to visit the chief prelate. The missionary found, however, that it was impossible to get access to this dignitary. He therefore went to Kyoto. There with his companions he at first spent ten days in fasting, prayer, and penance, as a preparation for the work upon which they were entering. Then, with his head shaved after the manner of the bonzes and wearing robes like theirs, but carrying a crucifix in his hand, he went into the streets and began to preach. The capital was at that time enjoying a period of tranquillity, and the people flocked about the stranger to hear what he bad to say. His peculiar manners and inaccurate use of the language made him an object of ridicule. Ere long, however, "through Otomo's favours and letters," and, strangely enough, "under the conduct of a Buddhist priest, one of the most respected men in the city," he obtained an interview with the Shogun, who received him with great favour and as a mark of honour drank out of the same cup with him. Moreover, the Shogun assigned him a house, favourably situated, where he was visited by many prominent citizens, some of whom invited him to their own mansions. It was not long before a person who is described as "one of the chief men" of the neighbouring city of Yamashina was baptised together with ten of his friends.

The enmity of the Buddhist priests was quickly aroused. In addition to denouncing the teaching of the preachers, they circulated all sorts of evil reports concerning them, saying among other things that they ate human flesh and that the bones of children bad been found in their dwelling. Their landlord was induced to turn them out, so that they were forced to take shelter in a dilapidated building, where they were the object of insults from crowds of ill-disposed men and children who came to annoy them.\* In some way, however, Vilela had gained the favour of Miyoshi, one of the Shogun's ministers. Thus it came about that proclamations permitting the missionaries to preach were posted throughout the city. This for a time put a stop to the opposition of the priests. Some of them even became believers. A great sensation was caused by the conversion of one of their number who had a great reputation for scholarship. It is said that among the writings adorning the walls of his room were sentences that seemed to show that by the light of nature he had attained to a knowledge of some of the truths held by Christians. One writing spoke of a God without beginning or end; another showed the dependence of the human heart on a Supreme Being who rules its movements. With an air of self-sufficiency this priest had come for an interview with Vilela; but after listening for some time to the latter's words, he suddenly called out: "I am a Christian. Baptise me." The news of his conversion spread abroad and fifteen other priests soon followed his example, Among them was one of upright life and austere manners who had vowed to devote his whole life to gratuitously teaching the Buddhist scripture known as Hokke-kyo. He told Vilela that a few years previously he had dreamed that priests came from India to teach the true way of salvation, and the very next day he learned of Xavier's arrival in Yamaguchi.

These conversions led to a new outbreak of hostility. It is charged against the Buddhist priests that they used bribes to induce the Governor of Kyoto to drive the preachers from the city. While he was seeking some pretext for doing what they desired, Miyoshi, who had learned of the plot, induced Vilela to withdraw for the time being to one of the minister's castles a few miles distant. Vilela consented, but afterwards, fearing that his act might be interpreted as a cowardly flight from danger, he returned to Kyoto, where he preached with as much boldness as ever. Miyoshi then caused a new edict to be issued which forbade any interference with the Christian teachers.

It is interesting to know that Vilela's rebukes of the immorality that prevailed in the Buddhist priesthood so stirred the followers of the Nichiren sect that they demanded a reform, deposing the abbot of one of their monasteries because he kept concubines, showed a mercenary spirit, and disregarded the Buddhist prohibition of animal food.

The number of missionaries at Funai was further reduced by the departure of Father Gago. He had at first been a very zealous worker and the instrument for many conversions. Not long after his return from Hakata it was noticed that he seemed greatly changed. He had lost his interest in evangelistic labours. He who had once thought nothing too difficult was now abashed by slight obstacles. He finally declared that his physical infirmities made it impossible for him to remain in Japan. Torres, who judged that one in this state of mind would be of no help to the work, consented to his departure, and he sailed from Bungo in October, 1561.

At this time the churches of Japan were reckoned as five in number—those of Funai, Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Hakata, and Hirado. These were in correspondence with one another, sending letters by which each gave intelligence concerning itself and exhorted the others to faithfulness. Father Torres, who had oversight of all, was in Funai, while Father Vilela was in Kyoto; but the departure of Father Gago left no ordained priests who could be put in charge of the churches in the other cities. Brother Almeida, however, set out in June to visit Hakata and Hirado. In the former city he baptised seventy persons, among whom was a Buddhist priest from Yamaguchi. Continuing his journey to the islands that belonged to the estates of Anthony Koteda, he found that all the inhabitants of Takashima were Christians with the exception of eight, and these were being taught by a converted bonze. They were soon baptised by Almeida. In Ikutsukishima there were said to be eight hundred Christians.

About the close of the year 1561, the captain of a Portuguese ship which had anchored at Kagoshima came to Bungo with some of his crew in order that they might make their confessions to Father Torres. They brought a letter from the Lord of Satsuma, who asked that some missionary might come to carry on the work that had been begun by Xavier. In this as in some other cases, the suspicion naturally arises that the desire to attract commerce to his port was the underlying motive in the mind of the writer of this letter. However that may be, Almeida was directed to go at once to Satsuma. He was gladly welcomed by the Christians of that province who had been left so long without instruction. Mention has already been made of his visit to the castle of Ichiku and of his interview in Kagoshima with the priests who had known Xavier. The Daimyo prepared a letter to be carried by the Portuguese captain to the Provincial of the Jesuits in India. Besides speaking of his admiration for the Christian religion and his desire to have it taught to his people, he was careful to call attention to the fact that the excellent harbour of Kagoshima afforded fine opportunities for European merchants.

While Almeida was in Kagoshima, Father Torres received letters from Sumitada, the Lord of the small principality of Omura in the western part of the island of Kyushu. The former Daimyo of Omura, who died in 1550, had left as his heir a son born of a concubine. For some reason the leading vassals were disinclined to receive this person as their lord and thus it came about that Sumitada, son of the Daimyo of the neighbouring fief of Arima, was adopted by the house of Omura as its head. Fie now desired to further the interests of his people by inducing foreign merchants to visit his ports. Following the advice of one of his retainers, he sought to make use of the missionaries for accomplishing his purpose. Charlevoix states that a book composed by Vilela had come into the hands of Sumitada and proved so convincing that he desired to meet one of the missionaries in order to confer with him about becoming a Christian; though, in order to conceal this purpose from his counsellors, he spoke to them only about the advantages of attracting foreign commerce. In his letter to Torres he asked that the latter would use his influence for bringing the Portuguese merchants to Omura. Among other inducements he promised that the foreigners might have for ten years, free from all taxes and duties, the use of the port of Yokoseura and the surrounding land within a radius of two leagues. No persons would be permitted to reside there without previously obtaining the consent of the Jesuits, for whom a residence would be built and a sufficient subsidy given to provide for its maintenance.

Torres at once recalled Almeida from Kagoshima and sent him to complete the arrangements at Omura, while he himself went to consult the Portuguese merchants at Hirado. As a result of his representations, a ship that was lying in the harbour hoisted anchor and prepared to sail to Yokoseura, the captain announcing that he did not care to trade any longer in a place where Christians were subjected to persecution. The Daimyo attempted to prevent by force the departure of the vessel, but his attack was repulsed by the Portuguese, who proceeded to the new port. Torres and Fernandez also hastened to Omura, where they met Sumitada, who assured them that it was his desire not to fall at all behind Otomo Yoshishige in his treatment of the missionaries and their converts. Yokoseura, which had been only a little village, quickly grew to be a flourishing town. The Portuguese merchants made it their chief port, and the favour shown to Christianity caused many Japanese believers from other places to remove thither. Sumitada himself had a residence there. In 1563 he was baptised and took the name of Bartholomew. He thus became the first of the Christian daimyos. Twenty-five of his leading retainers were baptised at the same time.

The morning after his baptism, Sumitada set forth to aid his elder brother Yoshisada, now the Daimyo of Arima, in a war that had broken out between the latter and the Daimyo of Saga. Hitherto it had been the custom for a daimyo before entering upon a campaign to worship at the shrine of the Goddess of War. Sumitada therefore marched with his troops to the temple, entered it with his body-guards, and then to the surprise of all beholders ordered that the image of the goddess be overthrown and dragged by a rope to the courtyard, where with his sword he struck off its head. The temple was then burned and a cross erected on its site. Sumitada, who had been much impressed by the story of Constantine as related to him by Torres, had figures of the cross inscribed on his armour and on the standards of his army. The successful outcome of the campaign he regarded as due to the special favour of God.

Sumitada advised his brother to open the port of Kochinotsu to the Portuguese on the same terms that had been granted in the case of Yokoseura. Almeida went to visit the city and in less than a month baptised two hundred and sixty persons, including the Governor and his family. He also visited the city of Shimabara, where he found that a company of believers had been gathered by one of the Japanese evangelists.

The religious zeal manifested by Sumitada aroused the opposition of the bonzes and gave occasion for several of his leading retainers to plot for his destruction. Not only had he caused some of the temples to be transformed into churches, but instead of burning incense before the ancestral tablets of the family into which he had been adopted, he threw them all, including that of his predecessor, into the fire. His enemies made the most of what they regarded as an insult to their former lord, whose bastard son, Takaaki, they now recalled. They had already obtained promises of assistance from the Daimyos of Hirado and Saga. The former made a sudden attack upon Omura, while the latter invaded Arima in order to prevent its Daimyo from going to his brother's aid. This was in August, 1564. The two cities of Yokoseura and Omura fell into the hands of the enemy and were set on fire. Sumitada with a small band of faithful retainers had taken refuge in the castle of Omura, where he was besieged by his former subjects, while the fleet sent from Hirado prevented any help from reaching him by sea. The rebels sent him word that they would return to their allegiance if he would renounce Christianity and banish it from his domains, a proposition to which he refused to listen. At the same time his brother was being hard pressed by his foes; but when the ex-Daimyo of Arima learned that his two sons were in such great danger, he took the field, drove the enemy from Arima, and then advanced to the help of Omura. He succeeded in establishing communication with Sumitada, who on October 4, 1564, made a sally just as his father's troops advanced from the other side upon the besiegers, who were utterly routed. At the same time a severe storm destroyed most of the boats that had come from Hirado.

Sumitada, triumphant over his foes, became more zealous than ever for the promotion of the religion that had excited their opposition. He put to death two of his retainers who in going over to the enemy had renounced Christianity, for he said that he could never trust persons who had thus broken promises made to God. Other revolts kept his territories in a confused state for several years, but more and more his enemies and those of his faith were subdued until Omura became outwardly almost entirely a Christian state.

Though the ex-Daimyo of Arima had hastened to the relief of his sons when they were in danger, he was very much opposed to Christianity, which he regarded as the chief cause of the misfortunes that had come upon them. His ill-will greatly increased the difficulties under which the missionaries laboured. Yokoseura was in ruins and its inhabitants scattered. When Torres visited Shimabara he found that its governor, though personally inclined to be friendly, had been forbidden to have anything to do with him. He therefore withdrew to Takase in the province of Higo, which was then in the possession of Otomo Yoshishige. While he was there Almeida also came, accompanying De Sylva, whose health was so broken that he died soon after his arrival.

The number of missionaries was however increased about this time by the coming of Father Louis Froez, Father Jean Baptiste Monts, and Brother Jacques Gonzalez. Froez was sent to assist Fernandez in the islands belonging to Anthony. A letter written by a Portuguese merchant and quoted by Crasset gives the following account of the earnestness of the Christians in those islands:

"I am confident that the Holy Ghost must live in the two islands of Takashima and Itsukishima belonging to Don Anthony, for none but those who see it with their eyes can imagine the innocency and fervour of these persons after living so many years in idolatry. I never saw any Christians like those at Takashima; they will not suffer a heathen to stay even one night amongst them. Every Friday throughout the year, whilst the Father says litanies, both great and little, old and young, fathers and children, torment themselves so cruelly with smart disciplines that it would even force tears from the very rocks to see them. Most of the men and women creep on their knees to a cross on a little hill where Christians are interred. To see them at their prayers you would take them for the most perfect European religious, and very few surpass them in austerities and fasts."

While Froez was in Takashima two Portuguese ships, soon to be followed by a third, approached Hirado. Froez sent a letter to their captains asking them not to enter the harbour without first getting from the Daimyo a promise that he would cease oppressing the Christians. Accordingly, when the Japanese officials went on board urging that the ships put into Hirado, they were told that this could not be done until the assent of Father Froez had been gained. The Daimyo, in his anxiety to secure the profitable trade, sent to the missionary making excuses for his former misdeeds and promising amendment. In accordance with a second letter from Froez, the ships now entered the port; but the captains refused to land any goods until authorisation had been given for the missionaries to live in Hirado and for a church to be erected at the expense of the Portuguese merchants, The Daimyo, while ready to make promises, was so slow in keeping them that Froez went out in a shallop to intercept the third vessel, whose commander agreed to remain outside the harbour until all was satisfactorily settled. The Daimyo finally yielded to the demands made upon him, and the third ship anchored beside the others.

As this last vessel had brought three new workers to the mission, Torres now redistributed the forces at his disposal. Two of the new arrivals, Fathers Jean Cabral and Melchior de Figueredo, were assigned respectively to Takashima and Kochinotsu, the latter port being chosen by Torres for his own residence. A third Father, named Balthazar d'Acosta, remained at Hirado with Fernandez. De Monts went to Bungo, while Froez and Almeida were sent to aid Vilela in Kyoto; but on the way thither Almeida was attacked by illness which led him to return to Kyushu. There were two other European Brothers \(Gonzalez and Sanchez\), besides four Japanese Brothers \(Lawrence, Damien, Austin, and Melchior\), and these were to be used in different places as necessity might arise.

While the events related were taking place in Kyushu, remarkable progress was made in Kyoto and its vicinity. Vilela had been directed by Torres to begin work in Sakai, whither he went in August, 1561. Though he found the character of its people such that after two years he declared that there was no hope of a speedy harvest, he had considered it advisable to remain there because of the civil strife that during most of that time convulsed Kyoto and the neighbouring country. After peace had been restored, he returned to the capital \(1563\). Following the plan previously adopted in Hirado, he set the young people to work proclaiming Christian doctrines and denouncing the Buddhist priests. For the same purpose he had some of the brightest boys from the orphanage in Bungo sent to his aid.

The bonzes presented to Matsunaga, who was Minister of Justice and a vassal of Miyoshi, a document in which they urged that an edict be issued against the foreign religion. Matsunaga replied that before consenting to any such action it would be necessary to make a careful examination of the new doctrines to see if they were as bad as the bonzes asserted. He therefore appointed two persons of high rank to take this matter in charge. Vilela and the Japanese evangelists found it advisable to withdraw once more to Sakai; but a Christian of Kyoto named Jacques, who had business with the Minister of Justice, was met by one of the commissioners and questioned about his faith. Though not possessed of much education, Jacques was able to explain his belief so well that the commissioner soon declared himself convinced that Christianity was true and asked him to send for Vilela to come and give fuller instruction. The missionary wished to set out at once in response to this summons; but his friends, fearing some plot, had Lawrence go in his place. Soon word came from the evangelist that it was even better than Jacques had reported, for the other commissioner was also ready to declare his belief in Christianity, Vilela therefore went to Kyoto, where he at once baptised the two new converts and also a relative of Miyoshi by the name of Shirai, who commanded the castle of Sangajima in the province of Kawachi. Not long after this, Vilela visited the estates of Shirai, whose son and sixty retainers, besides five hundred of the common people, were baptised.

Another important conversion was that of Takayama, the commander of the castle of Takatsuki about halfway between Kyoto and Osaka. It is said that he was a man of considerable erudition and that he had expressed confidence in his ability to refute the doctrines of the Christians so as to make even the foreign priest acknowledge that his religion was false. He therefore went to hear Vilela preach and at the end of the sermon entered into a discussion that resulted in his own confession that all his arguments had been overthrown. Soon after this he was baptised \(taking the name Dario\) together with his wife and his son, then fourteen years old, who afterwards became the most famous of the Japanese Christians, Takayama Ukon, or as he is called in the accounts of the Jesuits, Justo Ucondono.

From the first, the elder Takayama showed a great zeal in urging others to become Christians. It was largely through his influence that many men of high rank were baptised, among them being Naito, the Daimyo of Kameoka in the province of Tamba.

It was while Christianity was making such rapid progress that Father Froez reached Kyoto about the close of January, 1565. In February came the day which by the Japanese calendar was the beginning of the new year. On that day officials and men of high rank were expected to pay their respects to the Shogun. Vilela took this occasion for having his new associates presented at court. They took with them several gifts such as had been found adapted to the tastes of the Japanese. The Shogun showed such marked signs of favour to his foreign guests as to increase their reputation among the gentlemen of the court, leading these to press more eagerly than before to hear Vilela's sermons. Many of them expressed a desire for baptism.

Suddenly, just when it seemed as though the capital and surrounding regions were on the point of being completely won to Christianity, the work was interrupted by political disturbances. In the summer of 1565 the Shogun was murdered. The members of his family, with the exception of one younger brother who had become a priest, were also put to death, and all persons that had been closely attached to the Shogun were driven from Kyoto. Among those expelled were the missionaries, who thus had to suffer for the favours they had received from the murdered prince and his adherents. The Buddhist priests were quick to improve the opportunity. After failing in an endeavour to have the missionaries slain, they procured from the Emperor an edict prohibiting Christianity as an abominable religion. For three years the Jesuits were unable to reside in Kyoto.

It is not necessary here to give an account of the succession of conflicts that during the next few years were carried on between the different parties that were contending for political power. The Christians were divided in their allegiance. In following their feudal lords they often found themselves fighting against their brethren in the faith. At the close of the year 1565, two contending armies were encamped near Sakai. Father Froez sent invitations to the Christians on each side, asking them to come into the city for the celebration of Christmas, Accordingly large numbers of them came on the preceding evening, spent the hours until twelve o'clock in preparation for the sacrament, and then attended the midnight mass. They next went to the house of the missionaries, where they ate together, and at daybreak, after asking one another's pardon for what might come from the necessities of the coming conflict, they returned to their respective camps.

The outcome of the civil wars was such as to bring the real power into the hands of the noted General Nobunaga, although Yoshiaki, the younger brother of the murdered Shogun, was made the nominal successor to the office. Nobunaga had no great respect for Buddhism, nor love for its priests. In erecting a new palace for the Shogun he did not hesitate to tear down a monastery that was on the land he wished to use, and it is said that he went so far as to demolish idols in order to obtain the stone of which they were made. The priests soon saw that they could expect no help from him in shutting out their new rivals.

Takayama's brother and overlord, Wada Koremasa, had taken an important part in Nobunaga's campaign for making Yoshiaki shogun. He therefore had considerable influence with both the nominal and the real possessor of power. Though he had not been baptised, he was considered a catechumen and he became the protector of the Christians. He soon secured permission for the missionaries to return to Kyoto. Vilela had gone to Bungo, but Wada sent his brother Takayama to escort Froez from Sakai to Kyoto. Here the missionary was led into the presence of Nobunaga, who received him with marked distinction. At a second interview that Froez had with Nobunaga, a noted priest named Nichijo was present and Nobunaga took the opportunity to draw the representatives of the two religions into a discussion. When the debate turned upon the question of immortality, the champion of Buddhism, who had become very much excited, seized a sword and rushed upon Brother Lawrence, shouting that he would cut off his head so that it might be seen whether any soul remained after the death of the body. Wada and Hideyoshi, who were also present, were obliged to seize and disarm Nichijo.

Nobunaga gave written permission for Froez to reside in the city and to re-occupy the church building. This church was to have the same exemption from taxation that was granted to Buddhist temples, while it was to be free from the requirement by which under certain circumstances the temples were obliged to lodge soldiers. All persons were forbidden to molest the missionary or to prevent other people from attending his services.

The bonzes now had recourse to the Emperor, who was easily induced to aid them. He sent one of his nobles to remonstrate with Nobunaga for failing to consult with the source of all authority in the land before giving such great privileges to the teachers of doctrines that were subversive of everything that had hitherto been held sacred. According to Japanese writers, Nobunaga then entreated the Emperor to approve what had been done, and finally succeeded in having his request granted. This is probably a mere euphemism for saying that Nobunaga paid no heed to the Imperial messenger, and that the Emperor was unable to prevent whatever the powerful general had made up his mind to do.

Nobunaga returned to his own estates in Mino, leaving Wada as his representative in Kyoto. The priest Nichijo caused a rumour to be spread abroad that he had obtained the Emperor's permission to have Father Froez put to death. Wada at once sent out notice that, if any attempt were made upon the foreigner's life, the whole section of the city in which the latter lived would be held responsible and would be destroyed.

The next year, however, Nichijo had gained so much favour with Nobunaga that he was made a councillor of the Shogun. He took advantage of a temporary absence of Wada to renew his efforts against Christianity. Wada wrote to Father Froez advising him to go to Mino and have an interview with Nobunaga. In order that this might be secured, he gave the missionary a letter to Shibata, one of Nobunaga's generals. In accordance with this advice, Froez set out with Lawrence. Their reception was so favourable that they returned bearing documents which made it certain that neither Emperor nor Shogun would venture to issue orders for their banishment.

It was now Nichijo's turn to visit Nobunaga that he might bring accusations against Wada. The particular incident on which he chiefly relied for supporting his charges had arisen from Wada's great zeal in protecting the Christians. Two young men of the military class had snatched a religious medal from a Christian woman while she was at prayer in Wada's own mansion. He at once caused the chief offender to be beheaded and the other to be banished. Such a severe punishment for what was perhaps done only in sport very much excited Wada's enemies, and Nichijo made the most of it as a proof that the interests of the country were being made secondary to those of the Christian religion. Nobunaga, yielding to the words of the crafty priest, dismissed Wada from his office and confiscated a part of his lands. Great was the joy of the enemies of Christianity at Wada's downfall, since this opened the way for attacking those whom he had protected. Their triumph was shortlived. Nobunaga, on returning to Kyoto, expressed a desire to see Wada. The latter came before him with shaven head and mean clothes, as was appropriate for a person in disgrace. Nobunaga, regretting his dismissal of one who had been so good a warrior and officer, appointed him governor once more and made the restoration to favour more conspicuous by walking with him through the principal streets of the city. Nichijo, on the other hand, was deposed, and it was only the Emperor's intercession that saved the priest from death.

It was not long after this that Wada had an opportunity to requite the renewed confidence shown by his lord. In 1570, Nobunaga, while accompanied by a small escort, fell into an ambuscade of his enemies. It was Wada's bravery that prevented utter defeat and capture. Wada himself was severely wounded, so that he had to withdraw for a time from active duties. Much of this enforced leisure he used for receiving Christian instruction, He had already asked Froez to come and baptise him, when an attack upon his territories made him hasten to their defence, although his wounds were not yet healed. In the battle that followed he was slain. His brother Takayama then became master of the estates in Takatsuki and five years later gave them over to his son, who was then twenty-two years old.

It is time to turn back and see what had been happening in Kyushu. Although the desire to secure trade with the Portuguese had led the Daimyo of Mirado to grant the missionaries and their converts some privileges, he had no love for their religion. His eldest son and some of his principal retainers knew that they were in no danger of displeasing him by their open hostility to Christianity. Anthony Koteda was the object of much suspicion, which was increased by an intercepted letter in which Sumitada congratulated him on the success with which he was working to extend the Kingdom of Christ in his territories. Four men who brought this letter were put to death.\*

Some religious objects that had been brought from India for the adornment of the church in Hirado, had been seized by the unbelievers, and so came into the hands of one of the officials. He exposed a picture of the Virgin Mary to the mockery of the people after he had plucked out the eyes and otherwise disfigured it. The missionaries complained of this insult to their religion. As the Daimyo seemed disinclined to take up the matter, D'Acosta made use of means such as had formerly proved effective. By his request the Portuguese vessels held aloof from Hirado. After a while the Daimyo sent out a number of his warboats towards a ship that was seen on its way to a rival port, ordering them to make it come to Hirado or else to sink it. The attack was repulsed, many of the men from Hirado being slain.

In June, 1567, Juan Fernandez, who had come to Japan with Xavier, died at the age of forty-two. As he was not a priest, but only a lay brother, he occupies a less prominent place in the accounts of the Jesuits than does Xavier's other companion, Father Torres; but what is told of him encourages the opinion that no one deserves so much as he to be called the founder of the early Japanese Church. He was more successful than Xavier and Torres in learning the language. It is said, indeed, that Japanese became the only language that he commonly used, so that even in his death agony his prayers were in that tongue. He composed several books for the use of the Christians.

A few miles southwest from Hirado are the Goto Islands.\* In 1564 their ruler invited the missionaries to visit him, but it was not until 1568 that Brothers Almeida and Lawrence were able to respond to the call. They were lodged in the mansion of the Daimyo, whose family and chief retainers came to receive instruction. Just at that time the Daimyo became dangerously ill, whereupon the bonzes declared that this was a punishment sent upon him for introducing the foreign religion into his territories. Their arguments were considered to he sufficiently answered when the remedies prescribed by Almeida effected a remarkable cure. This was asserted to be a sign that heaven approved of what had been done. Shortly after this, however, a disastrous conflagration destroyed a large part of the city and at the same time the Daimyo began to suffer from a tumour on his hand. Almeida's medical skill relieved the latter trouble, but the loss resulting from the fire left the balance of accounts so unfavourable for the Jesuits that the people joined with the bonzes in demanding their expulsion. The Daimyo held out for a time, and there were some baptisms. Finally, however, Almeida and Lawrence withdrew. Two years later, the son of the Daimyo was secretly baptised with his wife and some of his vassals. The father, who at first seemed to approve this action, was afterwards led by the enemies of Christianity to make vain efforts for inducing the son to give up his faith, or at least to pretend that he had done so. He issued edicts against the Christians and was preparing to take active measures against them, when the son demanded that, if martyrs were to be made, he should be the first to suffer. The Daimyo finally assured the Christians that they would he left in peace. He died a few years later, while the enemies of Christianity were still' seeking a favourable opportunity to move against it. The son, on succeeding to the estates, showed great earnestness in trying to secure the conversion of ail his subjects. It is said that in the churches he would never tolerate any distinctions of rank, he himself sitting among the common people.\*

In 1566 the Lord of Shiki, on the island of Amakusa, was baptised with some of his vassals. When, however, he saw that his profession of Christianity did not help him to attract Portuguese traders to his ports, he lost interest in his new religion and began a persecution that led many of those who had followed him in receiving baptism to imitate him also in his apostasy.

Amakusa was divided among five petty lords under the suzerainty of Otomo Yoshishige. In 1568 one of these, the Daimyo of Hondo, asked that missionaries visit him. Warned by what had happened in Shiki, Almeida consented to go only on the conditions that there should be given written authorisation for him to preach; that for the first few days the Daimyo should by his own attendance on the services set a good example to his people; that, if the Christian doctrine was found good, one of the Daimyo's children should receive baptism as a guarantee that others could safely do so; and that the Daimyo should build a church.

These conditions were accepted. Hardly had the work of evangelisation begun when a revolt excited by the bonzes assumed such dimensions that Yoshishige had to send troops for the restoration of order. When the rebels had submitted, the Daimyo of Hondo was baptised \(1570\). Soon afterwards the rebellion broke out anew, and at length he issued an edict by which he banished the bonzes. He also warned the merchants who had assisted them by their contributions that they must either be converted or leave his territories.

In Omura Christianity was constantly gaming a stronger foothold. In place of Yokoseura, which had been destroyed at the time of the rebellion, another place was chosen as the port for foreign commerce, and soon what had been a little fishing village grew into the important city of Nagasaki. The Daimyo furnished funds for the erection of a church, which was dedicated in 1568.

Father Torres, the last of the little company of missionaries who first brought Christianity to Japan, died October 12, 1570, at the age of seventy-four. Shortly before this, Father Cabral had come to take his place as Vice-Provincial. A congregation of the Jesuits in Japan was summoned, all of them being present except Father Froez. As a result of the conference a re-arrangement of the Fathers was made as follows: the new names here appearing being those of persons that had lately arrived in the country:

De Monts in Bungo,       Lopes in Kochinotsu.

Acosta in Hirado,           Figueredo in Omura.

Valegnani in Goto,         Froez and Organtin in Kyoto.

Father Vilela's health was so impaired that he needed a change. He was therefore sent to India that he might report on the state of the mission and urge that more workers be sent. He died that same year shortly after reaching Malacca.

Pinto was also present, and the Jesuits were surprised to hear his voice joining with theirs as they pledged themselves to chastity, obedience, and poverty. When some one would have stopped him, Nugnez made a sign that he should be allowed to proceed. This he did and also added another vow by which he consecrated himself and all his wealth to the use of the mission. At the close, the Provincial signified his acceptance of the profession; but, as Pinto was the envoy of the Viceroy, it was decided that he should make no change in his dress until he had finished his official business. Though Pinto gave large sums for the work in Japan, his zeal for a religious life soon grew cool. It was found advisable to release him from his vows and he returned to India with Nugnez.

\* A letter written in 1576 by Father Cabral shows that, though these works of charity may have recommended Christianity to some persons, yet with others they became stumbling-blocks because for a long time the ranks of believers were chiefly recruited from the poor and from those who had been healed of loathsome diseases.

Others were unwilling to profess a religion whose acceptance seemed to classify them with such persons. The Annual Letter of the Jesuits for 1579, written soon after the baptism of Yoshishige, says that hitherto the converts had been almost entirely confined to the poor and those that had come to the hospital, one result being that non-believers despised Christianity as being the religion of the indigent and diseased.

### RAPID GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 1571-1582



IT has already been noted that Nobunaga had no love for the Buddhist priests. His anger had been especially excited against those of Mt. Hiei because on several occasions they had rendered aid to his enemies. He therefore determined upon their destruction. When he disclosed the plan to his generals, they were inclined to remonstrate against an attack upon temples which since the building of Kyoto had been considered a protection against demons and had been held in such honour by Emperor and people. Nobunaga insisted that the priests were little better than a band of traitors who were bringing evil upon their country. Their religious professions, he said, ought not to protect them; for they lived in constant violation of the precepts of Buddha, eating fish and keeping concubines. He declared that it was time these hypocrites and rebels were destroyed. In pursuance of this policy, Nobunaga's soldiers forced their way up the steep sides of the mountain, set fire to the buildings, and put to death every person they could find —priests, servants, concubines, and children. This event occurred September 29, 1571.

The temples of Mt. Hiei belonged to the Tendai sect. Three years later Nobunaga attacked the great monastery in Osaka, belonging to the Shin sect, which had also assisted his enemies. The so-called monastery was in fact one of the strongest fortresses in the land. Nobunaga failed in this attempt to take it, as he also did in subsequent sieges. It was not until 1580 that, by making use of the Emperor's intercession, he persuaded the abbot to surrender the castle and receive in exchange for it land and revenues in other places.

The Nichiren sect also suffered at Nobunaga's hands. It had consented to Set him decide a long-standing quarrel between itself and the Jodo sect. He would do this only upon condition that the leaders of the losing side should be decapitated. Representatives of the two sects came to his castle at Azuchi and there held a famous discussion which resulted in the defeat of the Nichiren advocates. Not only did they pay the prescribed penalty, but other prominent priests were banished, while the temples were crippled by large financial demands that were made upon them.

Nobunaga's dislike of the Buddhist priests made him the more ready to favour a religion whose success would help to undermine their power. In one of the letters that were sent by the missionaries as reports of their work it was said of him:

"This man seems to have been chosen by God to open and prepare the way for our Holy Faith, without understanding what he is doing, because he not only has little respect for the *Kami* and the *Hotoke,**\** whom the Japanese worship with such devotion, but he is furthermore the capita\! enemy and persecutor of the bonzes, inasmuch as among the various sects many are rich and powerful, and lords of great fortresses and rich territories, and by their opposition they have put him into great straits. . . . On the other hand, in proportion to the intensity of his enmity to the bonzes and their sects is his good will towards our Fathers who preach the law of God, whence he has shown them so many favours that his subjects are amazed and unable to divine what he is aiming at in this."

During Nobunaga's life the Christian religion made rapid progress in the central provinces of Japan. It was somewhat impeded, however, by difficulties arising from the civil conflicts of that period. The Shogun Yoshiaki, who grew tired of the constraint under which he was kept, joined with several daimyos in a plot for overthrowing Nobunaga. Among those siding with the Shogun was Naito, the Christian Daimyo of Kameoka in the province of Tamba. He marched to Kyoto with two thousand warriors whose banners bore the figure of the Cross, while on his own helmet the name "Jesus" was inscribed in golden letters. This uprising, which occurred in 1573, was unsuccessful. Yoshiaki was driven from Kyoto, though the title of Shogun was never formally taken from him. Nobunaga did not choose to allow the appointment of any one else and preferred to hold the real power himself under the title of Naidaijin, Minister of the Interior. Naito was replaced by a non-Christian daimyo.

In 1577 a large church edifice was completed in Kyoto. Money for its erection had been contributed by Christians of different provinces and some had come from non-believers, The Buddhist priests so exerted themselves in the attempt to prevent its completion that the Governor of the city was at last forced to threaten them with punishment if they persisted in their efforts. He himself contributed both money and materials.

A revolt that arose against Nobunaga in 1579, had among its leaders Araki, the suzerain of Takayama Ukon. The latter had now become the Lord of Takatsuki. Nobunaga besieged the castle of Takatsuki and sent word to Ukon that unless it were surrendered, all of the Christians in the vicinity of Kyoto, including the missionaries, would be put to death, "Ukon, who knew that Nobunaga would not hesitate to carry out his threat, sent a messenger to seek advice from Father Organtin, who was then in Kyoto. Nobunaga had been urging Organtin to use his influence in procuring Ukon's submission; and doubtless, as is stated in Japanese accounts of the affair, he used both threats and promises to make the missionary serve him, Organtin was permitted to enter the besieged castle, where he urged the wisdom of yielding. It was not easy for Ukon to accept this advice. His sister and his eldest son had been put as pledges of fealty in the hands of Araki; his mother and wife, in alarm at the thought of the probable fate of the hostages, begged him not to yield; and his father was opposed to surrender. Ukon finally decided that he would give himself up to Nobunaga, but would not surrender the castle. Having shaved his head and put on the dress of a religious recluse, he went with Organtin into the presence of Nobunaga, who received him back into favour. Meanwhile his father secured the safety of the hostages by promising Araki that he would defend the castle. He was soon obliged to yield to the superior force of the besiegers. Through his son's intercession the sentence of death, at first pronounced against him, was commuted into banishment to the province of Echizen. This proved not wholly disadvantageous to the Christian cause, for he and his wife, on reaching the place of their exile, were such zealous teachers of Christianity that they prepared the way for the missionaries to visit the province. Takayama Ukon was left in possession of Takatsuki.

It was the custom of the Christians to have great reunions in Kyoto and other places. One is mentioned as having been held in 1581, at Takatsuki, which was attended by fifteen thousand believers. In addition to religious exercises, which included an imposing procession, there were feasts and various kinds of games for the amusement of the people. One great attraction was a negro, whom the missionaries had brought from Africa. A report of this strange being reached Nobunaga, and at his request Father Organtin brought the negro to his palace. Nobunaga suspected some trickery, tried to see if the black colour could be washed off, and had the man stripped to see if it extended over the whole body. The missionaries permitted him to keep the negro as his own slave.

As Nobunaga wished to be near the capital and at the same time not too far from his ancestral estates, he began in 1568 to build a new city at Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa. In 1576 he made this his chief residence. The Jesuits describe in glowing terms the magnificence of his palace and the splendid entertainments that were given in it. They say that at one time a hundred thousand persons came as invited guests. Nobunaga had declared his unwillingness to have any other temple in the city than the one where his own image was to he installed in the place of chief honour. He, however, presented Organtin with land for the erection of a residence and a church. The Christians were quick to take advantage of this gift. Takayama Ukon furnished much of the necessary timber and also a large number of workmen to assist in the erection of the buildings. A school was also built that the children of the leading families might be taught the sciences and European languages. When this was opened, Nobunaga visited it and manifested much interest in its work. He also frequently invited the missionaries to come to his palace, where he questioned them about their religion and about affairs in Europe. His father-in-law was baptised, while his eldest son showed much interest in Christianity, and even told Organtin that he would gladly become its follower if it were not that it was beyond his power to keep the commandment against adultery. It was felt by the missionaries that many others were held back by the same difficulty. The Annual Letter for 1852, said:

"If sensuality did riot pervert their intellect, most of these lords would already be Christians; but the observance of this precept seems so hard to them that it makes their conversion difficult, so that many of them confidently allege that if the Fathers were a little broader with them in this commandment, they would at once become Christians. Among these lords the eldest son and successor of Nobunaga has discussed this three or four times with a Brother, wishing to persuade him that the Fathers should not proceed with such rigour in this matter, maintaining that if they did relax their rigour a great number of lords would forthwith be reduced to our Faith, and that so much was frequently said in the Court. Wherefore the said prince asserted that it would be doing greater service to God to dispense with this sixth \[seventh by the usual Protestant reckoning\] commandment, and thus make so many converts than to ruin all hopes of their conversion by our rigour in this precept, affirming that if it were dispensed with he himself would be the first to receive baptism."

Many Japanese have thought that Nobunaga became a Christian; but the letters of the Jesuits make it plain that, notwithstanding all the favours he showed to Christianity and the interest he sometimes manifested in its doctrines, their hopes for his conversion were not realised. June 22, 1582, he was slain at Kyoto by the treachery of Akechi, one of his own generals. Retainers and servants who ran to his assistance were also put to death, the only one to escape being the negro slave, who found refuge with the missionaries. When Hideyoshi, who had been Nobunaga's leading general, learned what had been done, he at once marched against the traitor, who, after his army had been defeated, took refuge in flight, but was beaten to death by some peasants whom he had asked to help him escape. Hideyoshi, though not without opposition, soon succeeded to the power that had been wielded by Nobunaga.

In Kyushu the Daimyo of Isahaya, a brother-in-law of Sumitada, having failed in his attempts to induce the latter to return to the Buddhist faith, became, in 1573, the head of a coalition against him. The Daimyo of Hirado was easily won to the plan. The Daimyo of Arima, who had failed to attract the Portuguese to his port of Kochinotsu, suspected that Sumitada had been secretly working against him, and so he became a third member of the league. Some of the castles in Sumitada's territory were commanded by persons so little in sympathy with their master that they treacherously delivered these into the hands of the enemy. The city of Omura was easily taken by the Daimyo of Ishahaya, who then attempted to surprise a neighbouring castle in which Sumitada was living. The latter, who had only fifteen retainers with him, knew nothing of what was happening until he saw the enemy approach. To conceal his desperate condition by giving the appearance of having more soldiers, he caused all the women in the castle to be dressed in armour. In a short time thirty Christian knights managed to force their way through the besiegers and came to his assistance. Others followed until the increase in numbers enabled him to overcome his enemies.

Sumitada now resolved to make his domains wholly Christian. When his knights and priests came to do him homage at the beginning of a new year, he spoke of the great blessing he had received from God and pleaded so earnestly that all of them, whether from interest or from policy, promised to study Christianity. Cabral, the Vice-Provincial, tells us that a Jesuit Father and a Brother "accompanied by a strong guard, but yet not without danger of their lives, went about causing the churches of the Gentiles with their idols to be thrown to the ground, while three Japanese Christians went preaching the law of God everywhere. Those of us who were in the neighbouring kingdoms all withdrew therefrom to work in this abundant harvest, and in the space of seven months twenty thousand persons were baptised, as were the bonzes of about sixty monasteries with the exception of a few who left this State."

The Daimyo of Arima had been led, after his defeat, to think more favourably of Christianity. He was baptised in 1576. So earnest was he in propagating his new religion, and so ready were his subjects to follow the example and exhortations of their lord, that, although he died the next year, there were said to have been at that time twenty thousand Christians in his domains. His son on succeeding to power issued an edict in which he ordered the missionaries to depart and all of his Christian subjects to recant. Many of his people were as quick to obey the commands of the new ruler as they had been to follow the wishes of his predecessor. Others threatened to emigrate rather than give up their faith. Fears that they might do this, and hopes fostered by Father Valegnani that the foreign merchants would frequent his port, probably had much influence in leading the young Daimyo to change his policy. Valegnani also acted as mediator in persuading the Daimyo of Saga to desist from military movements against Arima. One of his arguments may be surmised by Charlevoix's statement that the Portuguese "had promised at the instigation of Valegnani to serve Arima with their munitions and even with their persons. "After some delay the Daimyo of Arima was baptised in 1580, he being at that time twenty years old. He took the name of Protasius. He built churches, established a college for young men of high rank, and also built schools where instruction was given not only in Christian doctrine, but also in Portuguese, Latin, and such European arts as painting, clock-making, the carving of images, and the construction of organs.

Though Otomo Yoshishige, the Daimyo of Bungo, had gladly listened to the teaching of Xavier and other missionaries, had erected at Funai a splendid building that included a church, a residence, and a hospital, and in other ways had favoured the work of the Jesuits, he for many years was unwilling to declare himself a Christian. He professed a great desire to arrive at certitude in religious matters. While ever ready to listen to the Christian doctrine, he sent to Kyoto for Buddhist priests of the Zen sect, which was considered the most philosophical in Japan. After a while he dismissed them, saying that their teaching was inferior to that of the Christians. The missionaries believed that unwillingness to put away immoral practices was what kept him from conversion. He had many concubines and frequently added to their number. His legitimate wife was a strong Buddhist. The Jesuits describe her as a monster of wickedness, and in their letters often refer to her under the nickname of Jezebel. Her second son was being educated for the priesthood. A splendid and richly endowed monastery had been prepared for him, but when the time came for his removal thither, the boy, who was only fourteen years old, declared that he would not go, but wished to be a Christian. Notwithstanding the mother's opposition, Yoshishige gave his assent, and the boy, taking the name Sebastian, was baptised in December, 1575. The young convert soon showed his zeal by going with some of his companions into the city and breaking off the heads of a number of idols. When the bonzes complained of this conduct, the Daimyo upheld his son's act.

Among those that were led by the boy's example to declare themselves Christians was Chikatora, the adopted son of Sebastian's maternal uncle. The Daimyo's wife, who had failed to hold back her own son from accepting the religion she hated, seemed likely to be more successful in the case of her nephew, for she had the assistance of the father, who shut up the young man in a castle, so as to keep him away from the Christians. The relatives even begged Father Cabral to warn Chikatora that he ought not to oppose his father. The missionary did write a letter advising him not to seek baptism for a while, but to be obedient to his father so far as he could do this without offending his own conscience.

Chikatora's conduct was so pleasing to his father and to Jezebel that he was given more liberty; but at last the means by which they sought to alienate him from Christianity were such—some say recourse was had to magic, others that he was surrounded by temptations to licentiousness—that he ran away to the house of Cabral, begging to receive baptism, and the rite was administered April 24, 1577.

Yoshishige's wife tried to stir up the people to attack the missionaries, whereupon the Daimyo declared that any one molesting them would be severely punished. In other matters Jezebel's conduct was so displeasing that he finally divorced her. He then married another woman who was a catechumen, put away his concubines, and at last \(August 28, 1578\) was baptised together with his new wife. He was then forty-eight years old. In memory of Xavier, his first teacher of Christianity, he took the name Francis. At this time he was one of the most powerful lords in Japan, five of the nine provinces in Kyushu being subject to him. He decided to abdicate in favour of his eldest son, Yoshimune, a man of weak character, who, though numbered among the catechumens, long wavered between allegiance to Christianity and opposition to it.

The divorced wife of Yoshishige exerted all her influence to induce Yoshimune to favour the Buddhists. Her brother at one time seemed likely to succeed in securing the adoption of his proposal that the foreigners be slain, the churches destroyed, and Christianity proscribed. Yoshishige, however, still retained enough influence to prevent such action. At times, when military affairs or the exigencies of State required a stronger leader than the son, he resumed the actual administration of the government. He showed as much zeal against Buddhism as Jezebel against Christianity, In the Annual Letters of the Jesuits there are several passages describing his acts, of which the following are specimens:

"He captured a very strong place where was one of the chief temples and the most frequented in these parts, which had around it three thousand houses of the bonzes; and he at once gave orders to burn all the houses. The venerable temple was turned into ashes."

"The destruction of the monasteries in this kingdom proceeds. Their revenues are given to the soldiers. The bonzes are quitting their robes. Some marry, some go to the wars or to seek elsewhere their fortunes."

Doubtless the division of sentiment among the people, fostered in part by religious dissensions, had much to do with the misfortunes that came upon the Otomo family. Four of the five provinces that Yoshimune had received from his father were soon lost. Nothing was left but Bungo, and that was in a rebellious condition.

The Daimyo of Satsuma, son of the one that had been in power when Xavier came to Japan, was among those who had been asking for missionaries. The Annual Letter for 1582 is doubtless right in its surmise of his motives when it says: "The King of Satsuma, desiring that the Portuguese ships should go to his ports, and judging that if there were churches and Christians in his hands the Portuguese would be more readily induced to go there, treated of this matter with the Father Visitor and the Vice-Provincial. "In this as in other cases the Jesuits were not so dull that they could not see how the attempt was being made to utilise them; but at the same time they were too wise to neglect the opportunities that were thus afforded. Almeida made a second visit to Kagoshima to arrange for complying with the invitation. The Buddhist priests were once more aroused. It is said that they persuaded the Daimyo to order all his chief retainers to make a solemn promise never to become Christians, or allow their subordinates to do so. One prominent person who argued against this proposition was murdered, and the opposition to the foreigners was so strong that the Daimyo was obliged to tell Almeida that it was inadvisable to proceed with the negotiations.

In the Annual Letter of 1582 the condition of Christianity in Japan at the close of the preceding year was thus described:

"The number of all the Christians in Japan according to the Father Visitor's information amounts to 150, 000, a little more or less, of whom many are nobles, since besides the Kings of Bungo, Arima, and Omura, there are also many lords of different lands who, together with their relatives and vassals, are Christians, The majority of these live in Kyushu on the lands of Arima, Omura, Hirado, and Amakusa, where, with the others in the lands of Goto, there are 115, 000 Christians. In the kingdom of Bungo there are 10, 000; in the Kyoto district, with those scattered in the home provinces and Yamaguchi, there are 25, 000. The churches we have in those kingdoms where there are Christians, between great and small, are two hundred in number."

There had arisen a marked difference of opinion among die missionaries concerning the education that should he given to Japanese evangelists. Father Cabral, the Vice-Provincial, feared that the haughty spirit of the Japanese would lead them, if instructed in Western sciences, to despise their European teachers. Hence he desired to have them taught only so much as would enable them to occupy lower positions as helpers of the missionaries. On the other hand, Father Valegnani, who had come as Visitor General, favoured a more liberal policy, which led him to establish a college in Funai. Cabral's opposition was so strong that the Visitor found it advisable to send him to China and transfer his office to Father Coelho.

A few months before the assassination of Nobunaga, the ex-Daimyo of Bungo united with the Daimyos of Omura and Arima in sending an embassy to Europe. It is probable that the first suggestion of this came from the Jesuits, who desired on the one hand to arouse missionary enthusiasm in Europe and on the other to impress the envoys with the splendour of European cities and the power of the Church, so that their report might make the Japanese more ready to accept the religion of Western lands. Doubtless also the Japanese at that time, as has been true in later years, were desirous of learning through their own countrymen the truth concerning foreign lands and to use for their own benefit whatever of good might be brought back by those who had travelled abroad. We have already seen from Xavier's letters how an envoy had been sent from Bungo to the Portuguese colonies in India; the next step was to have Europe itself visited. Yoshishige selected as his representative a grand-nephew named Mancio Ito; the Daimyos of Omura and Arima sent a nephew of the former named Michael Chijiwa; to these were added two young men of high rank named Julian Nakaura and Martin Hara. Each of these persons was about sixteen years old. Probably those in whose names they went looked upon them less as envoys of state than as young men sent abroad for education; but in Europe they were received in such a way as would have befitted men holding the former position. Father Valegnani did indeed request that the courts to which they might go should not show them too much honour, since he feared that they might be puffed up with an undue sense of their own importance. This warning had little effect. Since the Jesuits in their letters had applied the title "king" to the daimyos, the young men coming in the names of these lords were treated as royal ambassadors.

They set out in a Portuguese ship that sailed from Nagasaki February 22, 1582, On reaching Goa, Father Valegnani, who was in charge of the party, found that he had been appointed Provincial in the Indies. He therefore turned over the care of the young men to Fathers James Mesquita and Nuñez Rodriguez. Owing to long delays at Macao, Cochin, and Goa, it was not until August 10, 1584, that the envoys reached Lisbon. At Macao they had been hailed with salvos of artillery, and in Goa the Viceroy had given them a splendid reception, hung chains of gold about their necks, presented them with three thousand crowns, and expended two thousand ducats in fitting up the quarters they were to occupy in the ship that took them on their way. This was but a prelude to what they were to experience in Europe. Their arrival in Lisbon and their slow progress to Rome were marked by a succession of magnificent fêtes. At the court of the Spanish King, Philip II., they were entertained as though they were royal princes. They spent three days in the Escurial and then went to the college of the Jesuits in Madrid, where they were visited by the King, the nobles, and the foreign ambassadors. Similar honours were shown them at Pisa by the Grand Duke of Tuscany; but the height of all was their reception at Rome. While they were yet two days' journey from the city, they were met by a troop of cavalry sent by Pope Gregory XIII, to escort them to the house of the Jesuits, where they were welcomed by Aquiviva, the General of the Order. As they were supposed to be still *incogniti,* their public entrance to the city did not occur until three days later, March 23, 1585. The Pope had held a consistory to decide upon what ceremonies would be appropriate. According to Crasset, Gregory by the advice of the cardinals ordered that the envoys "should be received publicly in the Royal Hall as ambassadors of crowned heads, and commanded that every one should give them the honour due to persons of that character, chiefly seeing this redounded to the honour of the Holy See, to the edification of the Church of Japan, and confusion of heretics."

On the morning of the public reception, the Japanese visitors were taken in the carriage of the Spanish ambassador to the Vineyard of Julius III., outside the city walls. There a procession was formed having at its head the troopers, the Swiss Guards, and the attendants of the cardinals. Next came carriages conveying ambassadors of France, Spain, Venice, and many other states, and followed by a mounted escort of nobles and papal officials. After these rode the Japanese themselves, clad in the ceremonial dress of their own land and wearing richly decorated swords. Mancio Ito, as representative of Otomo, came first, riding between two archbishops; while Michael Chijiwa and Martin Hara were each accompanied by two bishops. They were followed by Father Mesquita, who served as interpreter. Julian Nakaura was prevented by illness from taking part in the ceremonies. Many Roman nobles and gentlemen, riding on horseback, brought up the rear of the procession. As it entered the city by the Porta del Popolo and made its way towards the Vatican, the ringing of bells, the sounding of trumpets, and the booming of the cannon of St. Angelo united with the acclamation of the people to do honour to the visitors. When the Japanese were ushered into the Palace, they fell at the feet of the Pope, who was so moved with emotion that his eyes filled with tears as he raised the young men and tenderly embraced them. The letters that had been sent by their daimyos were then read. Translations of these documents are given by Crasset. Yoshishige's letter will serve as a specimen.

"To him that ought to be honoured on earth as holding the place of the King of Heaven, the most high and most holy Pope.

"After craving assistance of God my sovereign Lord, I made bold to write to your Holiness with a most profound humility. The Lord and Governor of heaven and earth, who holds under His empire the sun, moon, and stars, hath been pleased to dart a beam of His light upon me, at that time buried in most profound ignorance and darkness, and discovering the treasures of His mercy to the inhabitants of these countries. He sent about four and thirty years ago into these kingdoms the Fathers of the Society of Jesus, who sowed the word of God in men's hearts, and it pleased His divine bounty to let part of it fall on mine, a signal favour which I attribute with many others to your merit, most holy Father, and to the prayers of all Christian people. Had not I been quite broken with old age and infirmities, and otherwise prevented with grievances of war, I would have come myself in person to visit your holy places, and rendered you obedience, and after kissing your feet I would have set them very devoutly on my head and humbly begged of your Holiness to have made with your hand the sign of the Cross on my heart; but being prevented for the above reasons, I had thought of deputing in my place Don Jerome, my nephew, son to the King of Hyuga, but being at this present far from home, and withal the Father Visitor pressing to be gone, I substituted in his room Don Mancio, his cousin-german. Your Holiness holding the place of God on earth will oblige me and all the Christians in these parts if you will please to favour us with a continuance of your wonted kindness and protection. I received by the Father Visitor the reliquary which your Holiness was pleased to send me, and set it with great respect on my head. Neither tongue nor mouth can express how much I think myself obliged to your Holiness, I will make an end of my letter, for the Father Visitor and Don Mancio will give your Holiness a full account concerning either myself or my kingdom. I render you with all my heart a perfect submission of judgment and affection. I wrote this letter with a mighty dread and fear the eleventh of January, from the nativity of Our Lord 1582.

He that lays himself at the most
> > > sacred feet of your Holiness> > > > > > Francis, King of Bungo."
After the letters had been read, an "address of obedience" was made in behalf of the ambassadors by Father Gonsalez, a Portuguese Jesuit, in which the reasons for their coming were set forth. A reply was made in the name of Gregory, and the ceremony closed by the ambassadors' kneeling again to kiss the feet of the Pope.

A papal medal issued in connection with this embassy bore the inscription: "AB REGIBUS IAPONIOR. PRIMA AD ROMAN. PONT. LEGATIO ET OBEDIENTIA." \[First Legation and Act of Obedience from the Kings of the Japanese to the Roman Pontiffs.\] If this medal and the contents of the letters were known in Japan, they were well fitted to give rise to the suspicion which afterwards grew so strong that the missionaries and their followers were trying to deliver the country into the hands of foreign rulers.

It was only eighteen days after the ambassadors arrived at Rome that Pope Gregory XIII. died. They assisted at his funeral and at the coronation of Sixtus V. The new Pope made them Knights of the Golden Spur. Cardinals, princes, and the representatives of other countries were present at the ceremony of their investiture, the ambassadors of France and Venice performing the office of putting on the golden spurs. A still higher honour was shown when the Pope issued a brief authorising them to take part in consistories, a privilege that was usually accorded only to sovereigns. From the Senate of Rome they received the title of Roman Citizens and Patricians, each of the diplomas being "sealed with a great seal of gold as broad as one's hand, near a finger thick."

Several other cities of Italy were visited by the ambassadors,\* who then went back to Spain. Philip II. fitted up a ship for them at his own expense and added rich presents to the many that they had already received. They embarked at Lisbon, April 30, 1586, for their return voyage. Calms and a long stay at Mozambique so hindered them that it was not until May 29, 1587, that they reached Goa. Here they were detained ten months longer, and then, accompanied by Valegnani, who was appointed the Viceroy's envoy to Japan, they proceeded on their way, reaching Nagasaki July 27, 1590, to find that great changes affecting the interests of Christianity had taken place during the eight years of their absence.

### HIDEYOSHI 1583-1598
HIDEYOSHI AND HIS EDICTS AGAINST CHRISTIANITY 1583-1598



TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI, who succeeded in gaining for himself the power formerly possessed by Nobunaga, seemed at first to regard the Christians with much favour. According to some Japanese writers, he believed that the foreign religion was a source of danger, and so he was only waiting for a favourable opportunity to drive the missionaries from the land. However this may have been, it was worth while to secure the good will of the Christian lords and warriors. Among these Takayama Ukon held a prominent place. In 1583 Konishi Yukinaga, who became commander of Hideyoshi's fleet, was converted through Takayama's influence. Under the name Augustine, which he took at baptism, he has frequent mention in the letters of the Jesuits. They give him the title of Grand Admiral. In connection with the expedition to Korea he holds a prominent place in Japanese history. Another conversion occurring at about the same time as Konishi's was that of Kuroda Yoshitaka, whom the Jesuits term the General of the Cavalry. In their accounts he is called Simon Kondera. The governors of the important cities of Osaka and Sakai were Christians, as were also the officers whom the missionaries call the Secretary of State and the Grand Treasurer. Several daimyos and other men of high rank were either baptised believers or students of Christianity. Magdalen, the secretary of Hideyoshi's wife, and Jane Onogi, wife of the Daimyo of Fukuchiyama and considered the best poetess of that time, held important places among the ladies in Hideyoshi's court.

As soon as Hideyoshi's power over central Japan had become thoroughly established, he made a redistribution of the lands. Takayama Ukon was removed from Takatsuki to Akashi, in the province of Harima, where he was in receipt of larger revenues. Most of his retainers followed him thither. On arriving in his new possessions he gave notice to the Buddhist priests that they must remove all their idols from the land. When they saw that their attempts to resist this order were vain, they put the images on boats and sailed with them to Osaka, which Hideyoshi had made his headquarters. Here they appealed to Hideyoshi's mother, a devout Buddhist, and got her to intercede in their behalf; but it was all in vain, for Hideyoshi refused to interfere, saying that Takayama was free to rule his own territory as he pleased and that, if the priests did not know what to do with their idols, they would better drown them in the sea or use them for firewood. The report of this reply encouraged Takayama to go on in his efforts to make his fief wholly Christian.

After Nobunaga's assassination, Akechi and his followers had pillaged the palace at Azuchi. The establishment of the Jesuits had also been ravaged either by the soldiers or by the populace. The seminary with thirty of the pupils was therefore removed to Takatsuki. One of the missionaries wrote at this time in the following enthusiastic terms concerning the students:

"These youths progress greatly in virtue and in letters, and are of such good parts that what is learned in three years in the schools of Europe they easily master in four months. Already some of them begin to show themselves adapted for preaching and for confuting the falsity of the bonzes, with great hope of notable service to the Lord"

On Takayama's transfer to Akashi, it was decided to remove the school to Osaka. Hideyoshi gave land near his castle for the erection of the school and a church, he himself going in person with Father Organtin to select a suitable site.

A conversion that attracted much attention about this time was that of Imaoji Dosan, Hideyoshi's physician, a man who had been educated in the best schools of Japan and China, and who was the most celebrated practitioner in the country. Father Figueredo had occasion to consult this physician. Dosan, surprised to see a person of so great age whose general health seemed so good, asked him how he had preserved his strength. The Father replied that from childhood he had lived an abstemious life, had subdued his body by labour, and above all had learned the secret of contentment so well that, even though the ailment which brought him to seek advice should cut short his days, he would not be troubled thereby, since this would introduce him to a life incomparably better than the present and one that had the great advantage of being endless. Dosan, who did not believe in the immortality of the soul, began to argue and to ask questions which received such answers as finally led him to put himself under the Father's instruction with the result that after a while he received baptism. His pupils, said to number eight hundred, were also baptised, while many other persons were led to say: "If such a wise man as this believes the Christian doctrines, they must be true."

In May, 1586, Father Coelho, the Vice-Provincial, accompanied by eight Jesuits and a number of Japanese Christians, was received at the Osaka Castle by Hide-yoshi, who the previous year had been made Kwambaku, or Regent, thus attaining the highest office open to a subject of the Emperor.\* In a familiar conversation with the missionaries he was remarkably frank in telling his plans for the future. Father Froez, who was present, says:

"He told its how he was resolved to divide the southern kingdoms, minishing somewhat of the state of all the lords there and how he would destroy and ruin with a great army every one of them who refused to obey him. This lord evinced such liveliness in his countenance and such frankness as he uttered these words that we could perceive without the least doubt that he had not a shadow of suspicion of us. He also added that in the division of Japan he wished to give Justo Ucondono \(Takayama\) and Ryusa, the father of Augustine \(Konishi\), who were present, the kingdom of Hizen, leaving the port of Nagasaki to the Church, and for that letters paient would be issued,—but this, it was to be understood, was to be after he had thoroughly settled the affairs of Japan and taken hostages, because he wished to do everything in such a way that the Fathers should not be hated by the lords of Hizen. And he wished them further to understand that he made that donation to them on his own initiative and not at the instance of others...

"He also said that he had reached the point of subjugating all Japan; whence his mind was not set upon the future acquisition of more kingdoms or more wealth in it, since he had enough, but solely upon immortalising himself with the name and fame of his power; in order to do which he was resolved to reduce the affairs of Japan to order and to place them on a stable basis; and, this done, to entrust them to his brother Minodono, while he himself should pass to the conquest of Korea and China, for which enterprise he was issuing orders for the sawing of planks to make two thousand vessels in which to transport his army. And for himself he wished nothing from the Fathers except that through them he should get two great and well-equipped ships from the Portuguese, whom he would pay liberally for everything, giving the very best wages to their officers; and if he met his death in that undertaking, he did not mind, inasmuch as it would be said that he was the first lord of Japan who had ventured on such an enterprise; and if he succeeded and the Chinese rendered obedience to him, he would not deprive them of their country or remain in it himself, because he only wished them to recognise him for their lord; and that he would build churches in all parts, commanding all to become Christians and to embrace our Holy Law."

A few days after this Hideyoshi gave the missionaries a patent in which he granted them permission to preach in his states, exempted their establishments from the necessity of lodging soldiers, and released Japanese members of the Society from certain obligations to their feudal lords. He signed and sealed two copies of the document, expressing his wish that one should be sent to Europe in order to show Christian kings how much he favoured their religion.

The progress of events in Kyushu helped on Hideyoshi's plans for that island. The Otomos of Bungo had been so much weakened that the strife for supremacy among the daimyos was chiefly confined to those of Satsuma and Hizen. There were constant wars, into whose particulars it will not be necessary for us to enter. In 1586 Bungo was invaded by Satsuma, It is said that with the latter's army came many Buddhist monks, who delighted in the opportunity that was afforded them to destroy Christian churches. The missionaries, forced to flee, escaped to Shimonoseki and Yamaguchi.

In these straits Otomo Yoshishige went to Osaka and begged Hideyoshi to intervene. Nothing could have been more pleasing to the latter. The first generals whom he sent to oppose the forces of Satsuma were defeated. Funai was captured and Yoshimune fled to Nakatsu in the province of Buzen. Kuroda, who hastened thither, reproved the young man for his evil deeds and urged him to become a Christian. As a result of this exhortation, Yoshimune was baptised April 27, 1587, together with his wife, three children, and several retainers. He took the name of Constantine, Soon after this, Satsuma was driven back. Partly by force of arms and partly by diplomacy Hideyoshi succeeded in making all the daimyos of Kyushu submit to him. He then made a re-distribution of the territory. To Otomo Yoshimune was left only part of the province of Bungo. The Christian lords of Amakusa and Omura were not disturbed, while Arima recovered a part of the territory that had been taken by Satsuma. To Konishi was given the southern part of Higo and he was made a sort of supervisor over the whole of Kyushu. Kuroda was rewarded with a large part of Buzen. One of the Mori family, who had been converted through Kuroda's influence and who now married a daughter of Yoshishige, was given a fief in Chikugo. Another Christian received estates in Hyuga. Thus a considerable part of Kyushu came under the rule of Christian daimyos. It must have seemed to the missionaries that Hideyoshi had made a good beginning in carrying out the promises given to the Vice-Provincial.

It was about this time that the Christians of Kyushu lost the two men who had hitherto been their most illustrious leaders, Omura Sumitada died May 24, 1587, at the age of fifty-five; while a fortnight later followed the death of Otomo Yoshishige, who was fifty-eight years old. During the last part of his life Yoshishige had shown much zeal in the observance of religious ceremonies. Crasset says of him:

"He lived eighteen years after his baptism in piety and devotion, more like a perfect religions man than a worldly prince. He began his conversion by afflicting his weak and infirm body with cruel and continual penances. He fasted several days in the week, disciplined himself daily, and frequently too in public, to repair \(as he used to say\) the scandal he had given by his loose and libertine life.....He confessed and communicated five or six times a week. He recited his rosary daily on his knees, and over and above, another pair of beads with his domestics. . . . Every year he retired for eight or ten days to make the Spiritual Exercises. . . . Though he was naturally of a warlike disposition, yet after the unction of grace had penetrated into his heart he never waged war but in his own defence, and the fruit he reaped by it was extirpation of idolatry and the establishment of the Christian religion. This was his pleasure and glory above all other conquests. He hunted the bonzes like savage beasts and, in a word, took singular satisfaction in exterminating them out of the land."

While Hideyoshi was in the city of Hakata, the Vice-Provincial went thither to present his congratulations on the recent victories. The Regent, who appeared as friendly as he had formerly been in Osaka, promised to give him land in Hakata and assured him that he would always protect the Christian religion. How great then was the consternation of the missionaries when, in a single night, Hideyoshi's attitude towards them was entirely altered and an edict was issued in which they were ordered to leave Japan within twenty days.

What was the cause of this sudden change? As has already been noted, some Japanese historians state that Hideyoshi from the first was opposed to Christianity and had been waiting some good opportunity to declare his enmity. Another or an additional explanation given by some is thus expressed in the "History of the Empire of Japan," prepared by the Japanese Department of Education for the Columbian Exposition of 1893:

"When Hideyoshi in the course of his campaign against Shimazu reached Hakata, the Christian priests showed such an arrogant demeanour that Hideyoshi, enraged by their conduct, ordered that they should leave Japan by a certain day and prohibited the people from embracing Christianity."

Mr. Murdoch calls attention to Hideyoshi's custom of using outbursts of simulated fury to conceal his deep designs, and holds that Hideyoshi did not wish to extirpate Christianity, but only to reduce it to the position of a serviceable political tool. This led him to take active steps against Takayama, whom he regarded as too much under the control of the foreigners, while Konishi and Kuroda, as men that could be trusted, were left undisturbed.

Roman Catholic historians say that several causes united to arouse the enmity of Hideyoshi. The first was the evil conduct of the European merchants, most of whom gave themselves up to such debauchery as made the Japanese despise a religion that had so little good effect on the lives of its adherents. Thus Hideyoshi was led to think that the missionaries could not believe that the religion they taught was a help to virtue.. He one day dropped the remark that he greatly feared the upright conduct of the missionaries themselves was nothing more than a mask of hypocrisy used to conceal the plans of the Europeans to gain possession of Japan.

A second cause of distrust is said to have arisen in connection with an unusually large Portuguese ship that came to Hirado. Hideyoshi, who was thinking of having some vessels built in European style, asked Father Coelho to induce the captain to bring this ship to Hakata. The captain came in a small vessel, alleging that the shoals outside the harbour did not give sufficient water for the larger one. Hideyoshi spent three hours with Father Coelho and the captain on board the small boat, apparently satisfied with the excuse and pleased with the entertainment offered him; but it was afterwards thought that he suspected the merchants and missionaries had some secret reason for not wishing to accede to his request.

Most stress is laid by the Jesuits upon Hideyoshi's anger at the obstacle which Christianity offered to his own debaucheries. According to their account, a man named Yakuin, who had formerly been a Buddhist priest, had now become the procurer for Hideyoshi's licentious pleasures. Some Christian maidens of Arima, whom he urged to go to Hakata, rejected his offers with so much contempt that he returned baffled and angry. He arrived on the evening after Hideyoshi's visit to the Portuguese ship. The Regent was still making merry with some wine that he had received from the captain. When Yakuin told his adventures and declared that the Christians had treated him with such insolence and violence that he had been glad to escape with his life, Hideyoshi roared out that he would cut the throats of all the Christian women of Arima. Then Yakuin joined with others that were present in declaiming against the foreign religion whose followers, they alleged, were preparing to join the Portuguese in overthrowing Hideyoshi. There was even the pretence of disclosing a plot already formed for this purpose, with Takayama Ukon for its leader.

Hideyoshi was quick to take action. In the middle of the night Father Coelho, who had remained on the ship where the Regent had just shown himself so gracious, was aroused from his sleep and called on deck, A voice from the shore commanded him in very impolite language to come at once to land in order to receive a communication from Hideyoshi. The message proved to be a demand for answers to the following questions: "Why do you force the Japanese to become Christians? Why do you make your followers destroy the temples? Why do you persecute the Buddhist priests? Why do you violate Japanese customs by eating meat? Who has given the Portuguese permission to buy Japanese and carry them as slaves to India?" Shortly afterwards another messenger arrived, read an order that had just been issued for the banishment of Takayama, and departed without saying anything more.

The Vice-Provincial was overwhelmed with astonishment. He at once set to work at the preparation of a long letter in answer to the questions that had been asked. In it he said that Hideyoshi himself had given permission for the preaching of Christianity; that since this religion taught the existence of only one God, it was to be expected that those who followed it would renounce all idols and seek to overthrow the buildings in which they were enshrined, although the missionaries had never taken part in destroying temples except so far as the daimyos approved; that while it was not to be supposed that teachers of two religions so different as Buddhism and Christianity could work in harmony, the Jesuits had never maltreated the bonzes; that, although the missionaries according to the customs of their own country had eaten meat when entertained by the Portuguese merchants, they were willing to abstain from it hereafter; and that they were not accountable for the conduct of the merchants, whom they had often reproved for their traffic in slaves, an evil that could easily be prevented if Hideyoshi would prohibit the daimyos and others from selling captives and criminals to the foreigners.

The next morning \(July 25, 1587\) the following edict was published:

"Having learned from our faithful counsellors that foreign religious teachers have come into our estates, where they preach a law contrary to that of Japan, and that they have even had the audacity to destroy temples dedicated to our *Kami* and *Hotoke;* although this outrage merits the most extreme punishment, wishing nevertheless to show them mercy, we order that under pain of death they quit Japan within twenty days. During that space of time no harm nor hurt will be done them, but at the expiration of that term, we order that if any of them be found in our states, they shall be "seized and punished as the greatest criminals. As for the Portuguese merchants, we permit them to enter our ports, there to continue their accustomed trade, and to remain in our estates provided our affairs need this; but we forbid them to bring any foreign religious teachers into the country, under the penalty of the confiscation of their ships and goods."

Orders were sent to Takayama Ukon, who was encamped near Hakata, that be must give up his fief in Akashi and go into exile. For some time he dwelt on an island belonging to Konishi's estate. He was then ordered to remove with his family to Kanazawa in the province of Kaga. The daimyo of that place received him as a retainer, giving him a revenue that enabled him to support the faithful vassals that followed him into exile.

Coelho hoped to avert the threatened disaster by making a show of submission. As no ship was ready to sail to the Indies, he succeeded in having the time permitted to elapse before the departure of the missionaries changed from twenty days to six months. In response to his summons, all but two of the European missionaries assembled in Hirado for a conference. There were then in Japan forty Fathers and seventy-three Brothers, forty-seven of the latter being Japanese. It was decided that for the present it was advisable to refrain from all open exercise of their ministry. While awaiting the time set for leaving Japan, they accepted the asylums offered by the Christian daimyos of Kyushu.

There were still many conversions to comfort the hearts of the missionaries in these dark days. Among the prominent persons baptised was a nephew of Hideyoshi's wife. Another was the wife of Hosokawa,\* a daimyo whose possessions were in the province of Tango. She had first learned of Christianity by hearing her husband's account of Takayama's vain attempt to convert him. Hosokawa went with Hideyoshi to Kyushu, leaving his wife at Osaka and giving strict orders that she was not to go out from his mansion in that city. She, however, was so desirous to hear the preaching of the Christians that she managed to elude the guards and went with a few attendants to the church, where she was much impressed with the decorations and especially with an image of Christ that stood over the altar. The meaning of the emblems was explained to her by Father Cespedes. Afterwards she heard a sermon fay a Japanese Brother who, at its close, answered many questions that she propounded. She and her companions then asked for baptism. As she declined to give her name, it was thought that she might be one of Hideyoshi's concubines, and the missionary was therefore unwilling to grant her request. Meanwhile the guards at her mansion had become aware of her absence. When at last they discovered her in the church, they sent a litter to bring her home. After this she daily sent to Father Cespedes a trustworthy maid, with some attendants, to receive his instruction and then report it to her. Ere long this maid and sixteen of her companions were baptised in the church, but their mistress found it impossible to leave the house. When news came of Hideyoshi's edict for the expulsion of the Jesuits, her fear that the opportunity to receive baptism would be lost led her to devise a plan for going to the church by night. This was discouraged by the missionary, who gave the above-mentioned maid such instructions as enabled her to perform the rite. The character of the lady, who took the name Grace, is highly praised by the Jesuits. When her husband returned, his anger at what had been done led him to treat her for a while with great severity.

Of quite a different nature were the conversions forced upon the people of three cities that in the recent conflicts had come into the possession of the Daimyo of Arima. He ordered all to become Christians, and it is said that two thousand of them were baptised in the year 1587. He also aided one of his relatives to regain certain territories on receiving his promise that the inhabitants should be made Christians.

Though the Daimyo of Hirado destroyed several churches and overthrew the crosses that had been erected in the cemeteries, the only feudal lord that was led by Hideyoshi's edict to engage in active persecution of the Christians was Otomo Yoshimune. It was represented to him that as a baptised follower of the foreign religion he was likely to be treated in the same way that Takayama had been. Alarmed at this danger and pushed on by "Jezebel" and her brother, he refused to shelter the missionaries any longer, and issued orders to his subjects of such a nature that obedience on the part of Christians would have been equivalent to apostasy. Two of his retainers who refused to obey were put to death, as were also the wife, two children, and a servant of one of them; but this did not suffice to shake the constancy of others.\*

Yoshimune's brother, sister, stepmother, and some of his leading retainers set the example of disregarding his orders. A certain noble lady appeared in his presence with a rosary hanging from her neck. When Yoshimune, who had lately gone before Hideyoshi displaying ostentatiously a Buddhist emblem, asked how she dared to wear this badge of Christianity, she replied: "Sir, we ought to value the presents received from our lords. Since you yourself not very long ago presented me with this rosary, I show my appreciation of your gift by wearing it where all may see it. "It was probably fear of an uprising of the Christians that prevented Yoshimune from pressing measures against them.

Meanwhile, Father Coelho was endeavouring through the intercession of powerful friends to secure a withdrawal of the edict. All his efforts were vain. The six months of respite quickly passed away, and a Portuguese vessel was ready to set sail. The Vice-Provincial induced the captain to declare that the ship was so full of merchandise that he could not take many passengers. Only three Jesuits embarked, and they were Brothers who intended to go to India for ordination and then return to Japan. Though the captain sent messengers to Hideyoshi bearing excuses and gifts, the latter was so angry at the disregard for his commands that he destroyed the residences of the Jesuits in Osaka, Sakai, and Kyoto, together with twenty-two churches. Led probably by the suspicion that the foreigners were conspiring with the Japanese Christians, he somewhere about this time took Nagasaki away from the Daimyo of Omura, making it one of the imperial cities, such as were directly under his own control.†

On learning of Hideyoshi's anger, the Vice-Provincial called the Jesuits to Arima for another conference. It was decided that it would be better for all to assume a secular dress, to scatter more widely than before, and to avoid everything that would call attention to themselves. The Christian daimyos were ready as ever to furnish them refuge. Arima sheltered seventy, Omura twelve, Amakusa nine, Bungo five; while four remained in Hirado and two went to Kurume in Chikugo. As the separation of his islands from the main part of Kyushu made John of Amakusa feel more free to do as he liked, he insisted that the churches should not be closed and that as formerly the bells should be rung to call believers to the religious services, A display of independence in other matters soon brought him into trouble. He had declared that he was under no obligation to assist in the construction of a castle that Konishi, his suzerain, was erecting. Afterwards he disregarded Hideyoshi's orders that he come and give an explanation of such conduct. Hideyoshi therefore commanded Konishi to join with others in punishing him. Pie was soon forced to surrender to Konishi, who, after rebuking him for disloyalty, spared his life and even allowed him to retain his castle \(December, 1589\). Konishi also placed Christian governors over several other strongholds in the Amakusa archipelago.

News of Hideyoshi's opposition to the Jesuits reached Goa while the ambassadors who had been sent to Europe were tarrying in that city on their return journey. Following a suggestion sent by Father Coelho, the Portuguese Viceroy appointed Father Valegnani his envoy who should go to Japan for the purpose of expressing thanks for past favours shown to the Portuguese, and to request a continuance of the former relations. It was hoped that by going in this official position Valegnani could gain access to Hideyoshi, and it was believed that according to Japanese custom the admission of one of the Jesuits to the Regent's presence would be considered as equivalent to a revocation of the edict for their banishment.

Valegnani and the ambassadors tarried for some time in Macao. This gave opportunity for sending a letter to Hideyoshi asking if the envoy would be received. As the reply was favourable, the journey was continued so that in July, 1590, they reached Nagasaki, where they were joyfully welcomed by the Christians. Hideyoshi's attention was occupied with a military expedition and the illness of Valegnani caused further delay, so that it was not until January, 1591, that the envoy and the Japanese ambassadors set out toward Kyoto, where Hideyoshi then had his headquarters. Accompanied by a number of Portuguese, they made their way to Murotsu in the province of Harima. The deaths of Plideyoshi's son and half-brother caused a delay of two months to be made at this place, where Takayama Ukon and many other prominent Christians came to confer with Valegnani. Among the visitors was Otomo Yoshimune, who had previously sent a letter asking that his great sin in persecuting the Christians be forgiven. Many daimyos that were on the way to pay their respects to Hideyoshi came to hear from the ambassadors an account of what they had seen in Europe.

Various difficulties which at one time made it seem likely that Hideyoshi would withdraw his assent for an audience having been overcome, the envoy and his associates finally entered Kyoto with that display and splendour in which both Portuguese and Japanese delighted. This was considered the more necessary because some of the courtiers were endeavouring to persuade the Regent that the embassy was not genuine, but only a trick of the Jesuits. At the head of the procession two Indians led a richly caparisoned horse that the Viceroy had sent as a present to Hideyoshi. Two pages preceded Mancio Ito and his associates, who wore the robes of black velvet trimmed with gold lace that they had received from the Pope. Valegnani and two other missionaries were carried in litters, and the rear of the procession was brought up by the Portuguese merchants "in so rich attire that they might have appeared before the greatest monarch in the world. "Hideyoshi did his part to honour the occasion by a display of luxury and by bestowing rich gifts on his visitors. After the formal ceremonies were concluded, he spent some time in familiar conversation with them. He gave Valegnani permission to remain in either Kyoto, Osaka, or Nagasaki, until return presents for the Viceroy of India had been prepared. He himself was about leaving Kyoto for a short visit to his native town.

During Hideyoshi's absence, the missionaries and their companions were visited by large numbers of people who were interested in examining the maps, terrestrial globes, clocks, musical instruments, and other curiosities that had been brought. The Japanese ambassadors did their best to describe the wonders of Europe in such a way as to impress their auditors with a sense of the prosperity of Christian lands and the glories of the Roman Church. At this time, too, So Yoshitomo, the Daimyo of Tsushima, who promised that he would make his whole island Christian, was baptised, but in secret from fear of irritating Hideyoshi.

On the Regent's return to Kyoto, Valegnani took leave of him and went to Nagasaki. He then accompanied the ambassadors as they returned to their homes carrying the gifts that had been sent to their daimyos and making a report of the way they had fulfilled their mission. When all was over, the four young men made known the resolution taken while in Europe that they would renounce the world and seek admission to the Society of Jesus, Resisting the opposition of some of their relatives, they entered the seminary at Amakusa for study preparatory to taking upon themselves the vows of the order. In due time they entered the Society, though Chijiwa afterwards left it.

The two Governors of Nagasaki now caused such representations to reach Hideyoshi as were calculated to renew his suspicions concerning the missionaries. The explanation of their action that is given by the Jesuits is that these officials felt aggrieved because they had been omitted in the distribution of presents brought by Valegnani and also because they had not been given the honour of presenting him at court. However this may be, they informed Hideyoshi that the missionaries had paid no attention to his order for leaving the country and that since the coming of Valegnani they were openly holding religious services and baptising many converts. Arguments were also advanced to show that the professed embassy from India was only a trick for keeping the foreign priests in Japan, It was not difficult to arouse the suspicions of Hideyoshi, who now threatened to have the missionaries put to death. When rumours of the impending danger reached Valegnani, he at first proposed that all the Jesuits should withdraw to some island off the coast of China and there await better times. As the Christian daimyos opposed this proposition, it was finally decided that most of the missionaries should go to Amakusa, where they would attract less attention. Owing to this change, Amakusa became the centre of Japanese Christianity. Here were the leading schools and here was set up a printing press from which, in the coming years, were issued not only religious books but also a Latin-Portuguese-Japanese dictionary and a Latin Grammar in Japanese.

At about this time Kuroda induced one of the Governors of Kyoto to exert his influence in favour of the missionaries. Rodriguez had remained in Kyoto at Hideyoshi's request, and the Governor seconded his shrewd suggestion that, if there were doubts about the genuineness of Valegnani's mission, the Jesuits who had accompanied him might be retained as hostages until there had been time to communicate with the Viceroy, As this plan was adopted, there were left in Nagasaki several priests who were under no necessity to disguise themselves. The same Governor induced Hideyoshi to revise the letter that he had intended to send to the Viceroy. It had been written in a haughty tone and accused the missionaries of many evil deeds. The letter as finally sent was without these charges and, as the following extract shows, the objections urged against the work of the Jesuits were substantially the same as Japanese have brought against Christianity in modern times:

"With respect to religious matters, Japan is the realm of the *Kami,* that is to say of *Skin* \[the Chinese word for *Kami,* the deities of Shinto\], which are the origin of all things; the good order of the government which has been established here from the beginning depends on the exact observance of the laws on which it is founded, and whose authors are the *Komi* themselves. They cannot be deviated from without involving the disappearance of the difference which ought to subsist between sovereign and subject, and of the subordination of wives to husbands, of children to fathers, of vassals to lords, and of servants to their masters. In a word, these laws are necessary for the maintenance of good order at home and of tranquillity abroad. The Fathers of the Company, as they are called, have come to these islands to teach another religion here; but as that of the *Kami* is too surely founded to be abolished, this new law can only serve to introduce into Japan a diversity of cults prejudicial to the welfare of the State. It is for this reason that by Edict I have forbidden these foreign doctors to continue preaching their doctrine. I have even ordered them to leave Japan and I am resolved no longer to allow any one to come here to spread new opinions, I nevertheless desire that trade between you and us should always be on the same footing as before."

It was not until October, 1592, that Valegnani set out on his return to India. Meanwhile, the attention of Hideyoshi and of the Japanese was being taken up with the expedition against Korea. Many Christian warriors took a prominent part in this enterprise. Hideyoshi, who in giving over the title of Kwambaku to his nephew had taken that of Taiko by which he has since been commonly known, did not himself go to Korea as he had at first planned to do. The command of the two most important divisions of the army was given to Konishi Yukinaga, the Christian, and to his rival, Kato Kiyomasa, who hated the foreign religion. In order that each might feel himself equally honoured with the other, and perhaps for the purpose of increasing their emulation, the Taiko gave orders that their divisions should take turns in leading the vanguard of the army. In Konishi's division were four Christian daimyos, and a large number of the eighteen thousand soldiers were also Christians.\* They left Japan in May, 1592. The earliest successes were won by Konishi. Later honours, so far as honours could come from a war that in its motives and final outcome was little to Japan's credit, were somewhat equally divided between the two leaders, Japanese historians giving the greater praise to Kato.

It will not be necessary to describe the progress of this war, which lasted until the death of Hideyoshi in 1598. In 1594, Father Cespedes and a Japanese helper went by Konishi's invitation to Korea, where they not only cared for the spiritual welfare of the Christian soldiers but also gained many new converts. They remained in Korea, however, only two months, Kato while on a furlough in Japan tried to convince Hideyoshi that Konishi was engaged in a conspiracy by which he intended to make his followers all Christians and then lead them back to take part in a movement for overthrowing the Taiko's power. Hideyoshi, who had always been suspicious of Christianity, gave a ready ear to these accusations or, at least, pretended to do so. Konishi, on hearing what was being done, sent away Father Cespedes and soon after went to Kyoto, where he was able to re-establish confidence in his loyalty.

About the year 1590, John de Solis, a Spanish merchant who came to Nagasaki, considered that he was unjustly treated by the Portuguese traders. He was also angry with the Jesuits because they had sided against him in the controversy. At about the same time an apostate Christian named Harada, who had formerly been to the Philippines, managed to get access to Hideyoshi and suggested that it would be easy for the latter to bring those islands under his sway. Accordingly the Taiko, in 1591, sent a letter to the Spanish Governor demanding that tribute be paid to himself as suzerain. As Valegnani learned that this letter was to be sent, he wrote to the Jesuits in Manila informing them of what was being done. It was feared that the Governor in his indignation would write in such a way as would excite Hideyoshi's wrath against all foreigners, and the Jesuits therefore urged that the affair be so managed as not to prejudice the work of the missionaries.

The Governor sent to Japan one of his officials together with Father Cobo, a Dominican, with orders to tell Hideyoshi that a letter bearing his name had lately been received, but its contents were such as could be most easily explained by supposing that the document was a forgery. The two messengers landed at Kagoshima, where they found De Solis superintending the building of a ship in which he intended to leave the country. Seeing an opportunity to repay the Portuguese and Jesuits for their treatment of him, he went with the messengers to Hideyoshi, Harada served as interpreter It is asserted that he took advantage of his position to translate the words of the Spaniard so as to signify that the Governor was not averse to Hideyoshi's proposal, while on the other hand he put the Spaniards in good humour by an equally free rendering of what was said to them. De Solis's charges against the Portuguese were then presented. He said that they acted as though they were the lords of Nagasaki, that they prevented merchants of other countries from trading, that they treated the Japanese with cruelty, and that it was they who had kept the missionaries in Japan after Hideyoshi's orders of banishment. As a consequence of these denunciations the Taiko appointed a young man named Terasawa to be Governor of Nagasaki, ordering him to have the churches and other buildings of the Jesuits torn down, and to examine carefully into the conduct of the Portuguese merchants. Hideyoshi had a second letter written to the Governor of the Philippines in even more arrogant terms than the first.

The missionaries hidden in different parts of the country were in constant danger of being discovered by Hideyoshi's officials, who were travelling through the provinces to obtain supplies for the Korean expedition and to make out lists of able-bodied men. At one time a certain person had learned the names and hiding-places of all the priests; but they were able by means of bribes to induce him to keep silence. Those concealed in Nagasaki were in great peril, because a charge that the Christians were providing themselves with arms led to an order that every house in the city should be searched.

There began to be considerable anxiety among the Japanese lest news of the destruction of the religious establishments in Nagasaki should lead the Portuguese merchants to give up coming thither to trade. Among the upper classes had arisen a craze for Western ideas, which was even more intense than those which in modern times have swept over the land. European dress became common; crucifixes and rosaries being worn as a part thereof. It is said that the Kwambaku and even Hideyoshi himself followed the custom of wearing these religious ornaments. Some of the fashionable people carried their imitation of the Portuguese to the extent of repeating Paternosters and Ave Marias. Such was the demand for foreign goods that it would have been regarded as a grave misfortune if the Great Ship sent annually from Macao to Nagasaki should fail to come. As it was now overdue, people began grumbling at Hideyoshi for having offended the Portuguese. Terasawa, as the one responsible for carrying out the Taiko's orders, had to bear more unpopularity than was his due. This led him to suggest to Hideyoshi that steps should be taken to conciliate the foreigners. He also made advances to the Vice-Provincial, suggesting ways in which the priests ought to conduct themselves so as to regain favour. It was in accordance with his advice that when the Great Ship arrived Father Paez went with the captain to pay his respects to Hideyoshi under the pretence that he had just arrived in the country. Terasawa told Hideyoshi that the Portuguese were anxious to have the large church at Nagasaki rebuilt and to have ten resident priests to conduct its services. Consent was given and the church was quickly erected. This arrangement took away the need for concealment on the part of missionaries living in Nagasaki.

It is hard to believe that Hideyoshi did not know that Paez was no new arrival in Japan or that he was not well-informed concerning what the missionaries were doing. Indeed, many things in his conduct seem to show that he was not opposed to Christianity so long as it could be kept in subjection. When Konishi's father, who was the Governor of Sakai, died, Hideyoshi said to another son who was appointed his successor: "Remember that you are a Christian, and take heed to perform the duties of your office with the care and fidelity that your religion inculcates. "Thousands of converts were made between the issuing of the edict in 1587 and the death of Hideyoshi in 1598. Many people of high rank were baptised, and though in many cases the rite was performed in secret, it is not likely that what had been done could long remain unknown to the rulers of a country where the art of espionage was so well developed. Among the secret baptisms was that of Terasawa in 1595. Other noted converts were the lords of Gifu, Aizu, Obi, and Ina. Many converts of high rank were made by Father Organtin, whom Hideyoshi had permitted to reside in Kyoto upon the conditions that he should have no church and should not perform the rite of baptism. The second of these restrictions appears to have been lightly regarded, or it may be that the letter of the prohibition was observed by having the actual baptisms administered by others. Father Organtin had qualities that enabled him to gain many friends among the noble and wealthy families. He won to Christianity the man that was reputed to be the richest merchant of Kyoto. Organtin also understood how to inspire others with missionary zeal. A converted priest, six blind men of high rank, and Hideyoshi's master of the tea ceremony, are mentioned as being specially successful in winning members of noble families.

The last part of Hideyoshi's rule was marked by a new persecution, whose immediate object was not the Jesuits but the members of another religious order. In connection with this and subsequent events it is necessary to speak of the rivalry that existed between the religious orders and between the traders of different countries. We have seen that at first the Portuguese were the only Europeans who engaged in trade with Japan. In 1580, Philip II. of Spain became also King of Portugal. One article in the agreement made at that time was that to Portugal should be reserved the monopoly of commerce with Japan. In 1585, Pope Gregory XIII. issued a brief forbidding under pain of major excommunication that any but Jesuits should teach Christianity, administer sacraments, or perform any other ecclesiastical function in Japan except as special permission might be given by the Pope. Philip II. sent a copy of this brief to the Viceroy of India, enjoining him to see that it was strictly observed.

The Spanish merchants that had established themselves in the Philippines had long been turning their eyes towards Japan. They very naturally thought that if missionaries holding such relations to them as the Jesuits did to the Portuguese could get a footing in the land it would help toward the establishment of commercial relations. Hence it was that, as we have seen, a member of the Dominican order was sent in company with the Governor's envoy to inquire the meaning of Hideyoshi's letter and to see if an opening could not be found for trade. Both of these messengers were lost at sea on their return voyage. Harada, the rascally interpreter, had gone to the Philippines on another vessel, and he took advantage of this opportunity to pretend that he was Hideyoshi's ambassador and that his credentials were on the ship that was wrecked. A paper that he presented declared that Hideyoshi desired trade and also wished that there might be sent some Franciscan monks, since he had learned that that order was highly reputed for sanctity and devotion. The friars were the first to whom this document was shown and they were so delighted with the prospect opening before them that they helped to quiet any suspicions that the Governor had concerning Harada. It was decided that another official, together with Father Pierre Baptiste and three other Franciscans, should be sent to inquire the contents of the Taiko's letter that had been lost at sea. They reached Japan in June, 1593. Hideyoshi graciously received them and the presents they brought, but said he must insist upon being recognised as ruler of the Philippines, Father Baptiste, who apparently served as spokesman for the envoys, said that the Governor of the Philippines could not give his assent to this claim without first consulting the King of Spain, and he asked that the Spaniards be permitted to engage in trade until a reply could be received. Meanwhile, he and his companions were willing to remain as hostages. Hideyoshi consented to this arrangement, but imposed the condition that the envoys should not attempt to teach their religion to the Japanese. They chose to remain in Kyoto, but requested that they be given a residence in the suburbs, since, as monks accustomed to a quiet life, they found it unpleasant to live among people of the world. As their petition was granted, they at once proceeded to build a chapel where, in October, 1594, they began to say mass in the presence of Japanese Christians. Though the friendly Governor of Kyoto and many of the believers told them that they were running great risks of exciting Hideyoshi's anger, they paid little heed to such warnings. They were joined very soon by three more of their order, who came bringing a message from the Governor of the Philippines to the effect that he could not acknowledge Hideyoshi as his sovereign. Whether owing to the skilful way in which the refusal was expressed or to the promises of favourable commerce that were made, Hideyoshi showed no special resentment, but allowed these Franciscans to remain with the others. They now opened houses in Osaka and Nagasaki. They also became bolder in their preaching. When the Jesuits called their attention to the Pope's brief, they said they had done nothing contrary to its decrees; for it was not as missionaries but as ambassadors that they had come, and it could never have been the Pope's intention to prevent the clergy from performing the functions of their ministry wherever they might be. Probably they also used an argument that is found in books upholding their action on the ground that Sixtus V. in 1586 had issued a bull authorising the Franciscans to labour in the Philippines and other lands of the East Indies. It is claimed that this as a later decree repealed the prohibition of Gregory XIII.

The Jesuits were naturally very much irritated by what they considered an intrusion on territory reserved to them. They realised, too, that the course pursued by the Franciscans in openly disregarding the orders of Hideyoshi was likely to lead to more active measures against Christianity. In fact, after the Franciscans began work in Nagasaki, the officials of that city issued orders threatening punishment to any who attended mass; and in other ways they so interfered with the Franciscans that the latter decided to return to their brethren in Kyoto. There they did not hesitate, even before the Japanese Christians, to accuse the Jesuits of having been the means of putting an end to their labours in Nagasaki. A letter of Father Organtin tells of the great sorrow it gave him "to behold the best-founded hopes of soon seeing Christianity dominant in the empire vanish by reason of this fatal dissension."

The Jesuits had long desired to have a bishop appointed for Japan. The first to whom the Pope turned was so loath to leave his work in Africa that he was excused from taking the office, and two others that were successively chosen died on their journey to Japan. The next one appointed was Father Pierre Martinez, who arrived in Nagasaki August 13, 1596. Though the Christians did not venture to make in public so full a display of their joy as they would have liked to do, the Bishop on landing was met by the clergy in their robes and was preceded by crosses and banners as he was escorted to the church.

According to the stories preserved among the Japanese and by them repeated to Kaempfer, this Bishop and his successors acted in an arrogant way, being "carried about in stately chairs, mimicking the pomp of the Pope and his cardinals at Rome," and thus helping to increase the ill-feeling against Christianity. Soon after his arrival in Japan, so it was said, he "met upon the road one of the Councillors of State on his way to court. The haughty prelate would not order his chair to be stopped in order to alight and to pay his respects to this great man, as is usual in this country, but without taking any notice of him, nay indeed, without showing him so much as common marks of civility, he very contemptibly bid his men carry him by. . . . This great man, exasperated at so signal an affront, thenceforward bore a mortal hatred to the Portuguese, and in the height of his just resentment made his complaints to the Emperor \[Taiko\] himself. "Father Steichen in "The Christian Daimyo "doubts this story, declaring that the Bishop" was not, any more than any bonze of the lowest position, obliged by Japanese custom to descend from his litter under such circumstances;"\* that as bearer of despatches from the Viceroy of India he would be released from such a necessity, had it otherwise existed; and that the honour with which he was treated by Hideyoshi during the year of his stay in Japan shows that he had not incurred the Taiko's disapproval.

Bishop Martinez had indeed followed the example of Valegnani by coming with political as well as religions functions. While he was at Goa on his outward journey, Valegnani had arrived there with the letters in which, among other things, Hideyoshi asked whether that priest was in truth an official envoy. The Viceroy now entrusted his answer and many rich presents to the new Bishop, hoping thus to pave the way for him to gain the good will of Hideyoshi for both the missionaries and the merchants. While their official relations may have helped Valegnani, Martinez, and the Franciscans to get a foothold in Japan, it is easy to see that they would also tend to strengthen the growing suspicion that the missionaries were all emissaries of foreign governments and that their labours had some political object in view.

In July, 1596, the *San Felipe,* a Spanish galleon that was on its way from Manila to Mexico, was driven by a storm to Urado in the province of Tosa. Among its passengers were six priests. The local officers declared that by the laws of Japan the vessel should be confiscated. The captain sent two of the ship's officers and two Franciscans to ask the Taiko's permission to refit the galleon and proceed upon the voyage. These messengers had orders to do nothing except by the advice of Father Baptiste, the Commissary of the Franciscans. The Daimyo of Tosa, who professed to be friendly, had recommended them to the favour of an official named Masuda, who deceived them and advised Hideyoshi to have the vessel seized. The Jesuits assert that when this treachery was discovered an appeal was made by the Spaniards to Bishop Martinez, Father Rodriguez, and Father Organtin, all of whom were in Kyoto, where they possessed much influence. They accordingly did all they could, but it was now too late to effect anything. Masuda was sent to take possession of the wreck and its rich lading. In an endeavour to deter the Japanese from their purpose, the pilot declared that the King of Spain would certainly take vengeance upon those that so wronged his subjects. To prove to them the extent of that monarch's power, a map was spread out so as to show that he ruled not only over Spain and Portugal, but also over the Philippines, Mexico, Peru, and other lands. When Masuda asked how it had been possible to get such great possessions, the pilot replied: "The kings of Spain begin by sending out teachers of our religion, and when these have made sufficient progress in gaining the hearts of the people, troops are despatched who unite with the new Christians in bringing about the conquest of the desired territory." Whether the pilot hoped that his words would serve to excite suspicion only against the Jesuits and their Portuguese allies, or whether he was the forerunner of the many haters of all missionary work, who delight in disparaging the preaching of Christianity, it is certain that the remark had great influence upon Hideyoshi, to whom it was reported. Not only do European historians consider it one of the chief causes of the persecution that immediately followed, but Japanese accounts of the early missions describe the Spanish policy in terms almost identical with those used by the pilot.

An account of the confiscation of the ship that was printed in the Philippine Islands and sent to Europe held the Jesuits and their Portuguese partisans responsible for the misfortunes of the Spaniards. It declared that Bishop Martinez joined with others in petitioning Hideyoshi to drive the Franciscans from the land, and that they spared neither accusations nor promises in the attempt to induce him to do this, one of their assertions being that the Spaniards, instead of being driven to the land by a tempest, had intentionally come to Japan for the purpose of stirring up a revolt. This account went on to say that Hideyoshi, greatly scandalised at the baseness of the Jesuits, declared that the Franciscans were holy men whose virtues their rivals would do well to imitate. Nevertheless, the Bishop succeeded in exciting his desire to gain possession of the Spaniards' goods.

At about this time other attempts to arouse opposition against the Jesuits took the form of memorials, one addressed to the King of Spain and another to the Pope. The former made the surprising statements that, although it had been in the power of the Jesuits to have the daimyos of Kyushu recognise the Governor of the Philippines as their suzerain, they had been so lacking in loyalty to the King of Spain and Portugal as to invite Hideyoshi to Kyushu; that the missionaries themselves possessed estates that on the death of Hideyoshi they could render tributary to any ruler whom they wished; that they had thirty thousand armed men in their employ; and that of the Japanese who had professed Christianity all but six had abandoned the faith.

The other memorial, which was presented to the Pope in March, 1598, said that it was not hatred of Christianity but fear of the excessive power of the Jesuits that led Hideyoshi to oppose their teaching; that the Jesuits alone were proscribed, while the Franciscans had been treated with honour and given liberty to preach the Gospel, which they did with so much success as to lead back many that had apostatised; and that Valegnani when in Japan had appeared in court with an equipage not becoming a priest, for he wore pontifical garments, had a mitre on his head, and was followed by two hundred men in livery.

The Jesuits, aware of these attacks, took means for defending themselves; but ere either the charges or the defence could have reached Europe, both Jesuits and Franciscans were feeling the force of Hideyoshi's wrath. No sooner had the Taiko been informed of what the Spanish pilot had said than he took action. On the evening of December 9, 1596, the establishments of the Franciscans and Jesuits in Kyoto and Osaka were surrounded by guards. The governors of the two cities were ordered to draw up lists of persons who were in the habit of frequenting the churches. In a few days three Franciscan Fathers \(Baptiste, Aguirre, and Blanco\), three Franciscan Brothers \(Las Casas, Parilha, and Garcia\), Paul Miki, who was a lay brother of the Society of Jesus, two other Japanese who were novices preparing to enter the same Society, and fifteen persons in the employ of the missionaries were arrested. In the last group were boys only twelve, thirteen, and fifteen years of age. The Jesuit missionaries were left unmolested. There is reason to think that Hideyoshi did not care to have any harm come to the latter at this time. He is reported to have said to one of the officials in Kyoto that it was his desire to have only the priests from the Philippines apprehended. Apparently his irritation at the unwillingness of the Governor of those islands to acknowledge him as suzerain, as well as the suspicions aroused by the words of the Spanish pilot, led him to order the arrests. It is said that the setting of the guards about the establishments of the Jesuits and the apprehension of some of their Japanese followers came from a misunderstanding of his commands.

There was great excitement among the Christians, who at first thought that all of them would be arrested. Either to share in the glory of martyrdom or to exert their influence in favour of their brethren, many prominent believers, such as Takayama Ukon and the son of the Governor of Kyoto, hastened to the capital. A letter, of Father Organtin represents the Christians of all ranks as being ready to lay down their lives for the Faith.

The prisoners that had been arrested in Osaka were taken to Kyoto, There Organtin tried to obtain the release of the three Jesuits on the ground that they were held contrary to Hideyoshi's wishes. The Governor declared that, though he would be glad to free them, he could not do so without consulting Hideyoshi; and this, by calling attention to the Jesuits, might lead to more arrests.

On the third of January, 1597, the twenty-four prisoners were led through the streets of Kyoto to the northern part of the city, where the executioner cut off portions of their ears. They were then put on carts, three in each cart, and drawn through the city in order to expose them to the derision of the populace. Before each cart was suspended a placard which said in substance: "The Taiko has condemned these men to die because, though coming from the Philippine Islands as ambassadors, they have disobeyed bis commands by preaching the Christian religion. Therefore, they and the Japanese that have become their followers shall be crucified in Nagasaki."

The next day they were put on pack-horses and sent to Osaka. They were led through the principal streets of that city and Sakai, after which they were taken by land to Nagasaki. Everywhere they were subjected to the insults of the people, although in some places through which they passed the Christians came to speak words of cheer and exhorted them to be faithful unto death. By this protracted journey, which took over two months, a large part of the country was warned of the danger of following the foreign religion, while the place of execution was evidently chosen with the thought of having the Portuguese report to the people of Christian lands that missionaries could come to Japan only at peril of their lives.

The prisoners had at first numbered twenty-four: there were twenty-six when they reached Nagasaki. Father Organtin had sent two persons to follow after the captives in order to minister so far as possible to their necessities. On being discovered by the guards, these persons confessed that they were Christians, and accordingly, they were added to the others. An attempt was made in Nagasaki to secure their release; but the officials in that city feared trouble for themselves if they failed to execute all who had been delivered into their hands.

Father Baptiste had sent a letter to the Jesuits of Nagasaki asking that, if possible, arrangements be made for administering the sacraments to the prisoners. All that the officials would grant was that Father Paez might go to one of the towns through which the captives would pass and there shrive Miki and his two companions. Paez received the vows of the two latter, thus admitting them into the Society. Father Rodriguez, who had come to Nagasaki, managed to gain access to the prisoners and to administer the sacraments to some of them. As Terasawa, the Governor of Nagasaki, who had been secretly baptised, was absent at this time, the care of the execution came upon his brother Hasaburo. He as a boy had been a playmate of Pau\! Miki, and for years he had seen nothing of him until he met him among the captives that he must put to death.

There were fears that the Christians of Nagasaki might seek to rescue their fellow-believers. The prisoners were not brought into the city until the day \(February 5, 1597\) that they were to die, and then, instead of being taken to the usual execution-ground, they were led to a hill whose approaches could be easily guarded by men with muskets and spears. Death was by crucifixion, a method of punishment said to have been unknown among the Japanese until they heard of it in connection with Christianity. It afterwards became a common form of executing those guilty of heinous crimes. As it was practised by the Japanese, the victim was tied by ropes to a cross and, instead of being left to suffer for a long time, his body was pierced with a spear that was first thrust from the right side upwards towards the left shoulder and then from the left side towards the right shoulder. Thus the heart was usually pierced, causing instant death. It may be that this use of the spear was borrowed from representations that had been seen of the crucifixion of Christ.

After the martys had been bound to the crosses, some of them, especially Paul Miki, addressed the crowd of Christians and others who were pressing up as near as possible to them. Fathers Paez and Rodriguez had obtained permission to remain with the sufferers. Two Franciscans in disguise were in the crowd that stood outside the cordon of soldiers. When at last the execution was over, the Christians, unmindful of the blows that the guards bestowed upon them, pressed forward through the lines to dip kerchiefs in the. blood of the martyrs or to obtain shreds of their clothing.

In after times various stories were told of bright lights that shone over the martyrs, of the bodies that did not suffer corruption in the two months that they were left on the crosses, of blood that remained in a liquid state, and of a dumb woman who received the power of speech when she kissed Father Baptiste's cross. Two witnesses declared that ere the bodies were removed they saw Father Baptiste celebrating mass in the church, assisted by one of the martyred children. Amazed at this, they went to the execution-ground, where the cross of the Father seemed to be empty. The guards told them that the body often vanished and after a short absence returned to its place. These and other alleged marvels constituted a part of what was considered essential for justifying the canonisation of those who are now known as the Twenty-Six Martyrs, for it was not long ere steps were taken towards having them enrolled among the saints of the Roman Catholic Church. A brief issued September 14, 1627, by Pope Urban VIII. authorised the Franciscans to say the office and mass of the six priests and seventeen laymen connected with their order, and another issued the next day gave permission for the Jesuits to honour their martyrs in the same way. The canonisation to which this beatification formed a necessary prelude was long delayed; the chief reason, it is said, being the great expense involved. In March, 1862, Pius IX. pronounced the decree of canonisation, the imposing ceremonies connected therewith being performed the next June.

Soon after the arrest of the Franciscans, Hideyoshi issued a new edict in which he forbade any daimyo to become a Christian. He also directed that all the missionaries should be assembled at Nagasaki and at the first opportunity sent out of the country. He made an exception of Father Rodriguez, whom he used as an interpreter, of Father Organtin, and of a few others who were allowed to remain for the benefit of the Portuguese. Three or four Franciscans were at once deported.

There were now one hundred and twenty-five Jesuits left in Japan, of whom forty-six were priests. Terasawa, the Governor of Nagasaki, was still absent; but the Deputy Governor continued to demand that Father Gomez, who was then Vice-Provincial, should send these people out of the country. Gomez, after interposing all possible objections, thought it necessary to make a show of yielding. Though some of the missionaries remained in their places of concealment, most of them came to Nagasaki as though they were getting ready for their departure to Macao. The last vessel of that year weighed anchor in October, 1597. According to Charlevoix, "All the bridge seemed to be filled with Jesuits, although there were only a few students with their professors, two sick priests, and some catechists. The others were Portuguese disguised as Jesuits, and by this innocent stratagem, which had doubtless been concerted with Terasawa, Father Gomez saved his mission; but inasmuch as, in spite of the wise precautions he had taken to prevent the *religieux* from being discovered, it might happen that such a misfortune would overtake some of them, he caused the report to be spread that all of them had not had time to reach the port before the departure of the ship, and that he would profit by the first opportunity to make them embark."

Rumours that Hideyoshi was soon coming to Kyushu made the officials think it wise to enforce the edicts against the Christians. Early in 1598, one hundred and thirty-seven churches, the college in Amakusa, the seminary in Arima, and many residences of the Jesuits were destroyed. In some places the Christians were subjected to severe persecution. Those missionaries that did not succeed in concealing themselves were brought to Nagasaki for deportation.

Bishop Martinez died in 1598 while on his way to India, and in August of the same year his successor, Mgr. Cerqueira, arrived in Japan. One of the first acts of the new Bishop was to call together the leading missionaries for a consultation upon the question of slaves. The Portuguese merchants had been in the habit of purchasing prisoners of war and criminals, who were sold by the feudal lords, sometimes as slaves, sometimes as servants for a limited number of years. Bishop Martinez at first had issued licenses for this trade, but had afterwards prohibited it under pain of a fine, major excommunication, and the loss of the slaves thus bought. The new Bishop now asked advice as to the policy that he should pursue. The conference was unanimous in its opinion that he ought to renew the prohibition made by his predecessor, and to abstain scrupulously from giving any of the Portuguese licenses to buy or take away from Japan persons purchased either as slaves or under the name of servants bound for a certain number of years. He ought also to urge the King of Spain to renew and enforce laws concerning the liberty of the Japanese that had formerly been published by King Sebastian of Portugal. The report of this conference shows that the trade had been attended by terrible evils.\*

It was feared that Hideyoshi would be aroused to renewed activity against Christianity by an incident that happened about this time. Among the Franciscans that had escaped arrest in 1596, was one named Jerome de Jésus. Great efforts had been made to find him. According to one account, he was finally apprehended and sent to Manila; others say he had gone there of his own accord. However this may have been, in June, 1598, he, with another of his order, took passage from the Philippines in a Japanese vessel, whose crew betrayed them to the officials of Nagasaki. The Franciscans were arrested, but Jerome's knowledge of the country enabled him to escape. The Vice-Provincial of the Jesuits sent a messenger to Terasawa begging him not to have this reported to Hideyoshi. Terasawa accordingly sent his officers orders to keep the affair secret, but to put forth every effort for recapturing the fugitive. Enemies of the Jesuits hint that the latter had a part in securing the original arrest of the Franciscans and would have been glad to hear that Jerome had been again apprehended.

Immediate danger of increased persecution was removed by the death September 16, 1598, of Hideyoshi. He was undoubtedly one of the shrewdest statesmen Japan has ever produced. A recent writer† goes so far as to call him "the greatest man Japan has ever seen," and also, "the greatest statesman of the century, whether in Japan or in Europe, "Whatever his talents, there was much clay mingled with the iron; and it is not a cause for wonder that in the letters of the missionaries and in the histories founded upon them much emphasis is laid on the weak points in his character. In ecclesiastical history he will be remembered as a persecutor, and yet it should not be forgotten that throughout most of the time that he was in authority the teachers of a foreign religion were left unmolested, that he held some of them, as Organtin and Rodriguez, in high esteem, and that he appointed to important offices those that were recognised as leaders among the Christians. It is not strange that, seeing the splendour of some of the religious ceremonies and the honour shown by the believers to their teachers,\* he feared lest Christianity would succeed to the political and even to the military power that had been held by some of the Buddhist sects ere they had been crushed by Nobunaga and himself.†

We may at first be inclined to smile at the suspicions aroused by the unfortunate remark of the Spanish pilot; yet the mere fact that within a hundred years the Spanish kings had gained possession of much of America and India as well as of the Philippines and other islands, might well give cause for apprehension. Hideyoshi knew that messengers had been sent by the Christian daimyos of Kyushu to greet the King of Spain, and to bow at the feet of the Pope. Had he been acquainted with what European rulers and the Popes had done in connection with new countries, his fears would not have been lessened. Pope Martin V., about 1418, had granted to the King of Portugal all the territories that might be discovered by his navigators between Cape Bodajor and India. This grant was afterwards confirmed by Eugene IV. Similar concessions were made to the Spaniards for any discoveries they might make in sailing westward. In 1479 the rulers of Spain and Portugal had agreed that each would respect what had been granted to the other by these papal decrees. In 1493 Pope Alexander VI. issued his famous Bull of Demarcation, authorising Spain, on condition of planting the Catholic Church, to take possession of all lands that lie beyond the meridian drawn one hundred leagues west of the Azores, so far as these lands were not already subject to Christian powers. Though Portugal was not mentioned, it was understood that she could have all lying east of that meridian. Of Cabral, who was sent out from Portugal towards India in 1500, it has been said: "The sum of his instructions was to begin with preaching, and, if that failed, to proceed to the sharp determination of the sword."\*

The history of Spain at that time abounds with examples of this vicious linking together of religion and the power of the sword. The civil and ecclesiastical counsellors drew up a form of proclamation to be used by the invaders of new provinces in America. In case the rulers and people hesitated to acknowledge allegiance to Spain and to the Church, the invader was to give this warning: "If you refuse; by the help of God we shall enter with force into your land, and shall make war against you in all ways and manners that we can, and subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church and of their Highnesses; we shall take you and your wives and your children and make slaves of them, and sell and dispose of them as their Highnesses may command; and we shall take away your goods, and do you all the mischief and damage that we can, as to vassals who do not obey and refuse to receive their lord; and we protest that the deaths and losses that shall accrue from this are your own fault."†

Another proof that Hideyoshi's fears were not altogether foolish may be found in the fact that in 1575, twenty years before the ambassadors came to Japan from the Philippines, Captain Maldonado had sent from the same islands a report in which he asked that five hundred soldiers be sent from Spain in order that he might attempt the conquest of Loochoo and Japan.

The remembrance that Philip II. of Spain died only three days before Hideyoshi, may suggest a comparison between the two men and lead us to ask what would have happened if conditions had been reversed so that Japanese teachers of Buddhism had attempted to carry their religion to Spain and had pursued the methods that were used by the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries. One man's errors do not excuse those of another; but a comparison of Hideyoshi and Philip may at least help to soften our condemnation of the former, who, whatever his faults, does not deserve to have his name placed high in the list of those who in the sixteenth century were noted for religious intolerance.

† A history of Nagasaki published in 1902 says that about 1573 the man who owned the territory where the city was built had been obliged to borrow money to pay his share of Omura's military expenditures. He obtained the funds he needed from the Portuguese upon security of his land. When he failed to pay the debt and removed to another place to escape his creditors, they appealed to the Daimyo of Omura, saying that the money they had lent was not their own but had been entrusted to them by the Jesuits, to whom it had been contributed for missionary purposes. Hence, either the debt should be paid or the Jesuits should he put in possession of the land, Omura was not able to pay the money, and finally by the advice of Arima the land was given over to the missionaries, who governed it to suit themselves. The inhabitants, who were much displeased, awaited an opportunity to shake off the foreign yoke. In 1587 they appealed to Hideyoshi. After examining into the matter he declared that it was shameful to have Japanese territory ruled by foreign priests. He therefore made the land national property. The ancient records do not say what was done to settle the debt; but a fine was laid on each inhabitant for having allowed the evil to continue so long without informing the central Government, and it may be that the money thus secured was used to satisfy the claim of the Portuguese. Afterwards the fine was remitted. Tradition says that the people made some arrangement with the Christians for settling up the matter.

Could the facts underlying this story be sifted out, they might help to explain Hideyoshi's action against the Jesuits in" 1587.

\* It has been supposed by some writers that one of Hideyoshi's objects in the war with Korea was to get rid of the Christian leaders. If Konishi and his fellow-believers were slain, an end would be put to the trouble feared from them; if they were victorious, they could be rewarded by lands in Korea, and Japan would be free from their presence. There is little reason for thinking that such considerations had much to do with the decision to undertake the war or with the prominent position that was given to Konishi.

\* Whatever force the other arguments may have, those who remember that persons were expected to kneel beside the road when a daimyo's train passed, and that in 1862 one foreigner was killed and others attacked for not dismounting from their horses at such a time, will not think it unlikely that, when the feeling against missionaries was so strong, resentment would be felt against one who was thought to show lack of respect to a person of high rank

### INCREASED PERSECUTION UNDER IEYASU 1598-1616



HIDEYOSHI, shortly before his death, had appointed a board of five Regents, with Tokugawa Ieyasu at their head. Under their direction was another board of five Ministers. To these last was committed the care of Hideyoshi's son, Hideyori, who was then six years old. Ieyasu, who was born in 1542, had served under both Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. His original territories had been in the provinces of Mikawa and Totomi; but in the re-distribution of fiefs made by Hideyoshi he had been transferred to the provinces lying about the Bay of Yedo. He made Yedo his capital, building there a castle that became the centre of the great city that quickly grew up around it.

One of the first acts of the new government was to recall the army from Korea. This brought back to Japan some of the men who were recognised leaders among the Christians. The missionaries saw many reasons for believing that a new era of prosperity was about to dawn. Ieyasu's desire for foreign trade made him ready to favour Christianity, or at least to shut his eyes to the fact that the edict of Hideyoshi, though unrepealed, was not being enforced. The daimyos were allowed to treat the Christians in their own territories as they thought best.

Jerome de Jésus, the Franciscan that had escaped from prison, was arrested in December, 1598, and brought before Ieyasu, who, after hearing his story, said to him: Do not fear. Henceforth make no attempt to conceal yourself, and do not lay aside your ecclesiastical dress, for I wish you well. Every year the Spaniards in their voyages to Mexico pass very near my estates in Eastern Japan. I wish they would visit my ports to obtain supplies, trade with my people, and teach them how to develop the silver mines. In order that ere I die I may carry out my wishes in this matter, I desire that you will show me how it can be done. "Jerome suggested that he ask the Governor of the Philippines to send pilots, who by making soundings and surveying the coasts could render navigation safer. Ieyasu accordingly sent a messenger to make his desires known to the Governor; but since just at this time a number of ships and men had been sent from Manila to aid the King of Cambodia in his war with Siam, the Governor could do nothing except offer encouragement that on their return he might be able to accede to Ieyasu's requests.

Jerome for a while was given lodgings in Ieyasu's own mansion in Kyoto. He was then allowed to go to Yedo, where he built a church in which he celebrated the first mass on the Day of Pentecost in 1599. Afterwards he was sent by Ieyasu to Manila that he might help in securing success for a second envoy to the Governor.

The missionaries soon came out from their hiding-places. The churches that had been destroyed in Arima and Omura were rebuilt. Organtin re-established the houses of the Jesuits in Kyoto and Osaka. New residences were built in Yamaguchi and Hiroshima. Bishop Çerqueira says that in two years the number of baptisms amounted to seventy thousand.

There were, however, some drawbacks. Terasawa was now opposed to the faith into which he had been secretly baptised, and on returning from Korea he annoyed the missionaries to such an extent that in March, 1599, Bishop Çerqueira removed, with several members of the Society and thirty seminary students, to Amakusa. While Terasawa was on a visit to Kyoto he sent an order to his deputy that Japanese Christians should not be allowed to attend services in the church. Father Rodriguez was at once sent to Kyoto, where he succeeded in inducing Terasawa to revoke this order, and also received assurance from Ieyasu that the Christians would not be disturbed.

More serious trouble arose in Hirado, The Daimyo had recently died. The one who succeeded him was in Kyoto and sent back word to his son that all the people must be forced to take part in the Buddhist rites performed in honour of his predecessor. The son was also ordered to repudiate his wife, a daughter of Sumitada, unless she was willing to give up the Christian religion. She stood firm and sent for her brother, the Daimyo of Omura, to take her home; but her husband, unwilling to give her up, promised to leave her undisturbed in her faith. Several of the leading retainers, with their families and many other Christians, fled by night to Nagasaki, where they were sheltered by the missionaries. The Daimyo was so alarmed by this action, which was being imitated by others, that he sent orders to have none of the Christians molested.

In the year 1600 fourteen new Jesuit missionaries came to Japan. This brought the whole number of those connected with the Society, the Japanese included, to one hundred and nine. They were divided among six central and twenty-four subordinate residences. Many of the churches that had been torn down were now rebuilt, and new ones were erected. Several charitable institutions were also established. Konishi, since his return from Korea, had been very active in religious and philanthropic endeavours. It is said that in the year 1600 there were thirteen thousand baptisms in his daimiate. His nephew showed his zeal by declaring that all the Buddhist priests in the district under his care must become Christians or leave the country. Six of them chose the former of these alternatives. Konishi himself established a leper hospital in Osaka and appropriated annual rents worth one hundred *koku* of rice for the support of foundlings. He also bought a piece of land in Sakai to be used for a church, a missionary residence, and a cemetery.

The hopes of what might in the future be done by this powerful patron of the Church were doomed to disappointment. It was soon evident that Ieyasu was trying to gain the supreme political authority for himself, and a movement against him had for its leader Ishida who had shown much favour to the Christians. He induced Konishi to join him.\* The battle of Sekigahara, October 21, 1600, resulted in the utter defeat of the confederates and made Ieyasu the real ruler of Japan, Although he treated most of his enemies with clemency, Ishida and Konishi were condemned to death. They were beheaded at Kyoto in the dry bed of the Kamo River, and their heads were exposed on the principal bridge of the city. The Christians bore Konishi's body to the residence of the Jesuits for the performance of funeral rites. In his robe was found a letter addressed to his wife and children, in which he expressed his trust in God and exhorted them to remain firm in the faith. Four other Christian lords were deprived of their fiefs.

Fear of being involved in Konishi's ruin led So, the Daimyo of Tsushima, to repudiate his wife, who was Konishi's daughter. This meant also his rejection of Christianity. The divorced wife hastened to seek advice from Bishop Çerqueira, who procured shelter for her in the nunnery at Nagasaki, where with sad heart, separated from her children, she spent the remaining years of her life.

It will be remembered that, while Konishi's possessions had been in the southern part of Higo, the northern half of the province was held by his rival, Kato Kiyomasa, a strong Buddhist. When the civil war broke out, Kato, as a supporter of Ieyasu, laid siege to Konishi's castle in Udo. Among those shut up in this stronghold were two Jesuit Fathers, three Brothers, and some Catechists. According to Japanese accounts, after Kato learned the result of the battle of Sekigahara, he had letters attached to arrows and shot into the castle, giving information of what had happened and calling on the defenders to surrender; but the missionaries induced the soldiers to burn these letters without reading them. The Jesuit accounts say that Kato wrote letters to the two priests, urging them to prevent useless slaughter by persuading the leaders to submit. He also wrote to the Vice-Provincial in Nagasaki, asking him to use his influence to the same end. The Jesuits replied that, as religious teachers and foreigners, they had no right to interfere in matters of this kind. It was soon evident to the besieged that further resistance was useless, and on Kato's promising to spare the lives of all except Konishi's brother, the castle was surrendered. The missionaries were sent to Nagasaki after they had been held for some time as prisoners.

Otomo Yoshimune, who had taken advantage of the civil strife to make an effort for the recovery of his former estates, was also condemned to death, but through the intercession of Kuroda his sentence was commuted into one of exile. Afterwards he was allowed to go to Kyoto, where he lived in destitution except as Father Organtin procured help for him. He professed repentance for his backslidings, and in 1605 he died.

Early in the contests, those that acted in the name of Hideyoshi's son Hideyori seized as hostages the wives and children of many of Ieyasu's supporters. The soldiers came to the Osaka residence of Hosokawa, the romantic baptism of whose wife Grace has already been narrated. The steward of the mansion hastened to her, saying that Hosokawa, apprehensive of what might happen, had left orders that he should put her to death rather than allow her to fall into the hands of the enemy. She at once placed her two daughters in the care of a trustworthy woman that they might be taken to the residence of the Jesuits, and then she knelt before the steward. After he had performed his sad service, he set fire to the house and joined with the other servants in committing *hara-kiri.* Grace is said to have been a very talented as well as a devout woman. In order to write letters to the missionaries she had learned to read and write Portuguese, having no foreign instruction but depending on an alphabet and a few manuscripts received from her brother. She was greatly beloved by her husband. Though he was not a Christian, he caused Father Organtin the next year to conduct solemn funeral rites in lier behalf, and at the close of the ceremonies gave a large sum of gold to be used for the poor.

Reference has been made to the Brief of Gregory XIII. that had confined to Jesuits the privilege of preaching the Gospel in Japan. December 12, 1600, Pope Clement VIII., yielding to the request of Philip III., published a Bull that allowed other orders to engage in this work upon the condition that they went under the Portuguese flag and by way of Goa, This was not wholly satisfactory to those that desired a removal of the old restrictions, and we shall find that they paid little heed to the conditions, thus giving occasion for bitter dissensions that did much to hinder the progress of Christianity.

The same year saw the first coming of men from other nations, who were in time to be powerful rivals of the Spanish and Portuguese. It was in April, 1600, that the first Dutch ship came to Japan, Moreover it brought as its pilot an Englishman, Will Adams, who holds an important place in the history of Japan's relations with Western lands. A consideration of the state of affairs in Europe at that time will suffice to show that there was likely to be little love lost between the newcomers and their predecessors; while the Jesuits could not but be apprehensive that the advent of Protestants might be even more dangerous than that of rival orders.

Of a fleet of five ships that had sailed together from Holland, all but one had fallen out by the way, and this one met with severe storms and various disasters, until at last it anchored off the coast of Bungo. Of the twenty-four men on board, only seven were able to stand, and six died within a few days. In the main they were kindly treated by the people of Bungo, notwithstanding that the Portuguese tried to excite suspicion against them. In a letter from Adams to his wife he says:

"After wee had beene there fine or sixe dayes, came a Portugall Jesuite, with other Portugais, who reported of vs that we were pirats, and were not in the way of marchandizing. Which report caused the gouernours and commonpeeple to thinke euill of vs: in such manner that we looked alwayes when we should be set vpon crosses: which is the execution in this land for theeury and some other crimes. Thus daily more and more the Portu-galls increased the justices and people against vs."

After a while Adams with one of his shipmates was taken to Osaka, where they were brought before Ieyasu.

"He viewed me well, and seemed to be wonderfull fauorable. He made many signes vnto me, some of which I vnderstood, and some I did not. In the end, there came one that could speake Portuges. By him, the king demanded of me of what land I was, and what mooued vs to come to his land, beeing so farre off. I shewed vnto him the name of our countrey, and that our land had long sought out the East Indies and desired friendship with all kings and potentates in way of marchandize, hauing in our land diuerse commodities, which these lands had not; and also to buy such merchandizes in this land, which our country had not. Then he asked whethre our countrey had warres? I answered him yea, with the Spaniards and Portugais, beeing in peace with all other nations. Further, he asked me, In what I did beleeue? I said, in God, that made heauen and earth. He asked me diuerse other Questions of things of religions, and many other things."

In another letter Adams wrote:

"The Iesuites and the Portingalls gaue many euidences against me and the rest to the Emperour \[Ieyasu\], that wee were theeues and robbers of all nations, and were we suffered to liue, it should be ageinst the profit of his Highnes, and the land; for no nation should come there without robbing; his Highness iustice being executed, the rest of our nation without doubt should feare and not come here any more: thus dayly making axcess to the Emperour, and procuring friendes to hasten my death. But God that is always merciful at need, shewed mercy unto vs, and would not suffer them to haue their willes of vs. In the end, the Emperour gave them aunswer that we as yet had not doen to him nor to none o fins lande any liarme or damage: therefore against Reason and Iustice to put vs to death. If our countrey had warres the one with the other, that was no cause that he should put vs to death: with which they were out of hart, that their cruell pretence failed them."

Adams spent the remainder of his life in Japan, where he was "in such favour with two emperors as never was any Christian in those parts of the world." Ieyasu relied not a little on his advice concerning matters connected with foreign trade. He taught the Japanese how to construct ships in the European style, and was also a source of information concerning various sciences. He helped to open the way for Dutch and English commerce. Pagés says that in 1605, when one of the Jesuits visited Yedo, where "still dwelt the Englishman Adams and many Hollanders who were his companions," the missionary, in behalf of the Bishop, offered them a safe-conduct for going to Nagasaki, and from there wherever they wished.\* "In fact, it was feared that these heretics might scatter the seeds of evil among the people. The offer was declined by Adams, who alleged as a reason that the Shogun would never consent to his departure. The Father did all he could for the conversion of these unfortunate men, but he found them rebellious and confirmed in their error."

Adams probably did not hesitate to say things derogatory to the missionaries. He is said to have told Ieyasu that the Roman Catholic priests had been driven out of Protestant countries. This led Ieyasu to exclaim: "Why should I tolerate those that are not endured by European rulers?" Richard Cocks, who became the manager of the English factory in Hirado, wrote in 1614 about a friar who had a long argument with Adams, and for the purpose of convincing him offered to perform a miracle by walking on the sea. The affair was well advertised, so that thousands of people came to behold the event. The friar stepped out boldly into the water and would have drowned, had not one of the Hollanders saved him. He afterwards reproved Adams for lack of faith, saying: "Had you only believed, I should have been able to do it." He was afterwards obliged "for very shame" to leave the country and went to Manila, where the Bishop imprisoned him for his rash attempt that had brought dishonour upon the Church. Charlevoix, who also relates the incident, is inclined, as a Jesuit, to make merry over the discomfiture of this fanatic, who belonged to another order.

In 1601, Father Rodriguez, who had been sent by his superior to solicit Ieyasu's protection for the Christians, induced him to send an order to Terasawa, the apostate Governor of Nagasaki, that he should not annoy the missionaries or their followers. Two official patents, issued at the same time, authorised the Fathers to reside in Kyoto, Osaka, and Nagasaki. Before this, Terasawa had brought accusations against the Daimyos of Omura and Arima, because they openly professed Christianity and were erecting many churches, and Ieyasu had commissioned him to destroy the buildings and send the missionaries to Nagasaki. As the accused daimyos were at Ieyasu's court, they quickly learned of what had been done, and sent word to the Father Visitor advising him to tear down the churches himself, so as to prevent their profanation. Hardly had he begun to do this, when a messenger came with the welcome intelligence that the daimyos had been able to get Ieyasu's consent to their remaining Christians, and so there was no longer any reason for demolishing the churches. In fact, Terasawa had at this time fallen somewhat into disfavour. According to Pagés, one of the Governor's servants had purchased goods for Ieyasu without at all consulting Father Rodriguez, as it had been the custom to do. Since the goods did not prove satisfactory, the servant tried to throw the blame upon Rodriguez and the Portuguese merchants. An investigation that followed led Ieyasu to issue a patent providing that thereafter all purchases should be made through the missionaries and without Terasawa's assistance. Warned by this event that it was unwise for him to be on bad terms with the missionaries, Terasawa sought to win their friendship and promised that in Amakusa, which now belonged to him, he would receive them and favour their work. The next year, when he built a new castle in Amakusa, he gave land in its vicinity for a church and also paid for its erection.

Soon after Kato kiyomasa came into possession of the territory formerly belonging to Konishi, he commenced to persecute the Christians. Having banished the missionaries, he ordered the leading retainers to sign a document in which Christianity was renounced. Many were weak enough to yield, while some allowed others to sign in their behalf. The goods of those that remained faithful were confiscated, and they were forbidden to leave the daimiate as some others had done immediately after their former master's fall. Driven from their houses, they built huts for themselves in the fields and forests. Other people were forbidden to rent houses to them or sell them food. The Bishop and other Jesuits sent letters to comfort the afflicted Christians, and one missionary managed to reach them in disguise.

The persecution was kept up until the middle of 1602, when Kato, apparently moved by fear that his acts would be censured by Ieyasu, permitted those who desired to do so to depart from his domains. The most of them went to Nagasaki, where the Jesuits gave them shelter and provided for their necessities. We shall soon see that no long time elapsed ere still more bitter persecution arose in Higo.

Father Moralez, the prior of a Dominican convent in Manila, had asked some Christians who formed part of the crew of a Japanese vessel visiting that port, if there would be an opening for his order in their country. As their reply was favourable, he wrote a letter to the Daimyo of Satsuma offering to send missionaries. In due time a ship came from Satsuma bearing a letter that invited the missionaries to come and promised them a favourable reception. The merchants of Manila were desirous of having closer commercial relations with Japan. One of the early acts of a new Governor of the Philippines had been to give what was in the main a favourable response to a second envoy who had been sent by Ieyasu, though to his request for shipwrights the reply was made that the consent of the King of Spain must be obtained before any could be sent. The ecclesiastical and secular councils having been summoned to consider what ought to be done regarding the letter that had now come from Satsuma, they were agreed that "for the sake of the propagation of the Christian faith and for the service of the King of Spain" missionaries of different orders ought to go to Japan. The particular field that each society should occupy was also decided.

In accordance with these plans, several missionaries set out in 1602. The Dominicans sent Father Moralez as Vicar Provincial, with four others of his order, to Satsuma. Apparently they went on the Japanese ship last mentioned; and in accordance with the orders given to the captain by the Daimyo, they were landed on an island named Koshiki, where a Buddhist temple, from which the priests had been removed, was assigned for their temporary abode. In a few days they were summoned to the Daimyo's capital. The favour with which they were received awakened the opposition of the Buddhist priests, who demanded the expulsion of the foreigners. While the Daimyo did not yield to this demand, he became less cordial, disregarded his promise to give land to the missionaries, and failed to provide them with a due supply of the necessities of life. After waiting three months and seeing no improvement in his attitude towards them, they went back to the island of Koshiki.

The Franciscans, who were nine in number, went at once to pay their respects to Ieyasu, taking with them a letter and presents from the Governor of the Philippines, Ieyasu at first showed that the substitution of so many religious teachers for the ship carpenters that he had requested was far from pleasing to him. He soon, however, resumed his good humour, and on the whole they had little reason to complain of the treatment they received. Four of them went to Yedo, where, by his permission, they built near the church that was already there a monastery and a hospital. The others remained in Kyoto, where they also built a monastery.

Two Augustinians landed at Hirado and soon after went to Bungo, where, in accordance with permission received from Ieyasu, they built a church and a residence.

Thus, notwithstanding the monopoly once granted to the Jesuits, three other great orders had come to share their labours, their triumphs, and their sorrows. Little attention was paid to the conditions under which the Pope had finally assented to their coming; for, as has been seen, they sailed directly from the Spanish colony without taking the trouble of going first to Goa. Petitions had been sent to Rome asking that the restrictions be removed, and it was claimed that the Pope had given so much encouragement to believe this would be done that the missionaries were justified in utilising the present opportunities. The Jesuits were very much incensed at this disregard of the papal mandates.\* During the following years a bitter conflict raged between them and the other orders, especially the Franciscans. Each side tried in various ways to get the advantage over the other, and the letters written to Europe abounded with charges and counter-charges. These contentions had not a little to do with the increasing distrust excited among the Japanese against the missionaries. The division extended to the native Christians and did not cease with the expulsion of the foreigners. Two and a half centuries later, when descendants of these Christians were discovered in Kyushu, it was found that they were still divided into groups having to some extent different religious vocabularies, paying homage to different saints, and suspicious of each other.

A report written in January, 1603, by Bishop Çerqueira shows something of the methods of the Jesuits' and the condition of the work at that time. It says:

"In every daimiate where a body of Christians is found, there is a principal house or college with its rector. There are also other residences distributed among the villages. The Fathers in these residences are not only visited annually by the rectors, but they usually assemble a few days every two months in the principal house, where they confer concerning their spiritual progress and the care of souls. Each residence has usually a church of a size proportionate to the population. In these churches reside certain tonsured men called *Kambos*, who are held in great esteem among the Christians. They are charged with preserving good order and propriety, with giving doctrinal instruction to children, and with reading spiritual books to the people on Sundays and feastdays if there is no Father, Brother, or *Dogique* to preach. It is also the duty of the *Kambos* to visit the sick, to summon the Fathers for the confessions of such persons, to inform the Fathers about all disorders and about the temporal or spiritual needs of the Christians, and especially to baptise children in danger of death, when there is not time to call a Father. They help in burials and in other necessary offices for the good of souls. The Fathers likewise support in the seminaries, as also in other houses and in the residences, a considerable number of *Dogiques* \(as the native pupils are called\). These are much esteemed in Japan and are held in high honour because they have renounced the world in order to serve our Lord in the Church. These *Dogiques* are clad in long robes and live as *religieux.* In general, they all learn the method of catechising and are trained to preach, so that they may go into the villages when the Fathers and Brothers are absent. They chant the office in chorus and form a choir to aid in the celebration of mass, having learned for that purpose the full chant, the musical chant, and how to play the organ. There is already a large number of organs that have been made by the *Dogiques* themselves, as also harpsichords, viols, and other instruments. These on occasion help to give solemnity to worship. The presence of these *Dogiques* and *Kambos* supplies to a noteworthy extent the insufficiency of workers felt by the Fathers, and the Christian community finds itself greatly helped by them, I have elsewhere stated that, as shown by the appended reports, the number of Fathers and Brothers of the Society is one hundred and twenty-six; that of the *Dogiques* exceeds two hundred and eighty-four; and that of the *Kambos,* one hundred and seventy. Thus all the workers supported by the Society and helping in the conversion of this people amount to more than five hundred and seventy persons, not to mention the servants and the labourers for carrying baggage and performing other services, who live in the houses and residences. Such persons are numerous, for the Japanese by the customs of the country have their employment defined; each must perform work in accordance with his condition, and the labour of servants cannot be taken by the *Dogiques.* Hence, in fact, the Society usually supports more than nine hundred persons.

"I have stated that the Fathers in the residences are constantly making circuits among the villages in order to instruct the Christians and to administer the sacraments. In the midst of a thousand difficulties and trials they busy themselves night and day with the confessions of the sick, travelling through rain and snow as well as through excessive heat, and going with great zeal to places two or three leagues from their residences. I have found that among the *Dogiques* a large number learn Latin so that they may be more helpful in these ministrations and also in order that they may become Brothers or Seminarists. Great numbers of them have been received into the Society under these last titles. I myself have brought together many of these *Dogiques.* I keep them in my house, where they study theological themes in order to become clerics. Others learn painting and the art of engraving on wood so as to make pictures or blocks for printing in European as well as in Japanese characters, which is a great help for this church. I have found the churches very well provided with paintings in oil or distemper, which the *Dogiques* know how to execute marvellously well, many of them being excellent artists. The Fathers distribute a great number of pictures in water colours and of engravings. This helps arouse the devotion of the Christians. As reported by the Rector of Nagasaki, Latin and Japanese books have been published, a great number of European books and various spiritual treatises having been translated and printed in Japanese characters. I have personally seen and examined some of these books, and have given permission for printing them. Afterwards they are distributed by the same Fathers, to the very great benefit of the Christians.

"All of these things are not accomplished without costing the Fathers a large sum. I have made proof of this and have actually seen the expenditures that the Fathers make to erect and adorn the great number of churches under their care. In fact, the Japanese are usually poor and are oppressed by their lords, so that, although they contribute by means of their own labour as well as by gifts of timber and other materials used in the construction of churches, the expense in silver and commodities for paying the carpenters or supplying artisans and labourers falls entirely upon the Fathers. Notwithstanding that all the churches, like most other buildings in Japan, are constructed of wood, and that their size is proportioned to the localities where they are situated, the expense amounts to a large sum. In small villages the cost of a church is ten, fifteen, or even thirty cruzades; and in other places fifty, eighty, or one hundred. For the churches of the principal cities one hundred, eight hundred, or one thousand crusades are spent. In the city of Nagasaki three thousand were spent, although in fact the greater part of this sum has been realised from the alms of the Christians in that city, as is noted in the report of the Rector of Nagasaki. Churches like those of Nagasaki, Arima, and Omura are not and could not be built without the permission of the lord of the country nor without his providing at least a part of the funds. This is stated in the reports of the Rectors of Arima and Omura. Moreover, as all the churches are of wood, it follows that they are easily destroyed and annihilated by fires, persecutions, and wars.....I find, nevertheless, that at the present time, that is, at the beginning of 1603, the Fathers of the Society possess in Japan two colleges—that of Nagasaki and that of Arima—; a house of probation in the place called 'All Saints'; two seminaries—a great one in Arima and a smaller one in Nagasaki—; and independently of these establishments, twenty-one residences where Fathers are domiciled in different provinces; with more than one hundred and eighty churches, as reports presented to me declare. As to the number of Christians; before the war of 1600 and when the lands of Augustine, Simon Findecan, and other Christian lords were in their primitive condition, it may have reached three hundred thousand\*. . . Meanwhile, as a result of the war and the re-distribution of fiefs, all the Christian communities have suffered great loss. The Christians have scattered among the different provinces; some have apostatised because of the pressure of their gentile lords; and others are dispersed among the gentiles without constituting a company or a religious family."

In 1603 Ieyasu took the decisive step of having himself appointed Shogun. This rank had not been taken by Nobunaga or Hideyoshi; indeed Ieyasu was the only one of the trio who was a descendant of the Minamoto family, to which custom prescribed the limitation of the honour. By this step he placed himself above Hideyori, whom he left in possession of the strong castle of Osaka with a large revenue to be derived from three provinces.

Though Hideyoshi's edicts against Christianity had never been repealed, the new Shogun showed no inclination to have them enforced. Indeed, he himself gave financial aid to the missionaries. The only regular source of support for the Jesuits was in the subsidies sent by the Pope and the Spanish King. Often these were deficient or their payment was delayed. That of the King had fallen into arrears. These subsidies were sent by way of Macao, where with the Pope's approval the money was invested in merchandise that formed part of the cargo brought by the Great Ship that annually sailed from that port to Japan, Sometimes the failure of the vessel to complete the voyage caused the missionaries great trouble. It was thus in the year 1603, when it was captured by the Dutch. This misfortune came at a time when the care of the exiles from Higo was increasing the burdens of the missionaries. As a consequence, they were obliged to dismiss some of their pupils and to retrench expenses in other ways. On hearing of their distress, Ieyasu sent them a gift of three hundred and fifty taels and offered to lend them five thousand more until the arrival of the next annual ship.

In August, 1603, Father Bermeo, the newly appointed Commissary of the Franciscans, reached Japan and at once wrote a letter to Bishop Çerqueira enclosing communications from the Archbishop of Manila and from others in the Philippines, including the Vice-Provincial of the Jesuits. In his reply, the Bishop with courteous but plain words rebuked the zeal that led to disregard of the papal prohibitions. He said that his conscience compelled him to refuse the Franciscans permission to exercise their ministry in Japan, for he could not admit them as labourers in that vineyard until they proved that they had proper authorisation for doing what the Popes had forbidden.\* In utter disregard for his authority, the Franciscans proceeded to establish new residences in Osaka and Sakai, while at Kyoto a Japanese Christian, in fulfilment of a vow, built for them a monastery and a church.

Meanwhile the Dominicans, on the island of Koshiki, were living in great destitution. On hearing of their devotion and austerities, the Daimyo offered to assign to them the revenues of a small village. They replied that the rules of their order did not permit the acceptance of such a gift. They consented, however, to use for a time a boat with twelve oarsmen that he put at their disposal for conveying them to and from the mainland of Kyushu, whither they frequently went for evangelistic work. He afterwards gave them permission to build a church and a residence in the city of Kyodomari.

Persecution was renewed in Higo. It is asserted that Kato Kiyomasa at first gave orders for the execution of all his officers who were Christians, but was led to desist by the thought that such an act would excite horror and might enable the Christians, who were numerous in Ieyasu's court, to bring about his downfall. As he had done before with those who had been Konishi's leading retainers, so now he did with many others, confiscating their goods and driving them from their homes. In October, 1603, he visited several cities, coming first to Yatsushiro, where he gave the officers charge to do all they could to make the Christians apostatise. In November, all the under-officials were ordered to appear before a famous bonze who had been invited to the city that he might superintend a ceremony that implied an acceptance of Buddhism by all that took part in it. Some who had been numbered among the Christians shared in the exercises, but fourteen refused. Afterwards these yielded, with the exception of two, John Minami and Simon Takeda. The former of these had shown less bravery two years before when, in order to save his own life and the lives of his family, he had signed the promise to renounce Christianity, a weakness of which he soon repented. Takeda's name had also been signed to the paper; but this was done without his consent by a friend who wished to protect him. At this time, therefore, their sentences declared that, since they continued to adhere to Christianity after having abjured it, they with their families were condemned to die. Orders were given that the two men should be sent to Kumamoto for execution while the members of their families should be put to death in Yatsushiro. The officer that was charged with the duty of carrying out these orders was a very intimate friend of Takeda and, wishing to save him from the disgrace of a public execution, obtained permission that he also should suffer in Yatsushiro. He did his best to induce Takeda to abjure his faith and even offered to connive at his escape. The execution took place in Takeda's own house. An account, perhaps somewhat embellished, is given of the way in which the sentence was carried out December 9, 1603, a little after midnight, an executioner came bringing to Takeda a letter in which his friend told him that he must be beheaded that night. When Takeda had finished reading the missive, he thanked the bearer, and after kneeling a few minutes before a picture of Christ, went to awaken his mother, Joanna, and his wife, Inez. They prepared for him the bath that it was customary for the Japanese to take under such circumstances. After writing a few letters, Simon entered the hath and, on coming out, he clothed himself in his richest garments. He then said farewell to his mother, wife, and servants. From these last he asked pardon for any wrong that he might have done them, gave each of them a present, and exhorted those that were Christians to stand firm in the faith. Three catechists who resided in the city had been called to assist him in his preparations for death. They, the two women, and the Christian servants, joined with him in repeating the General Confession, three Paternosters, and three Aves. To his wife he then said: "The hour for separation has come. I go before you and thus show the road by which you also should reach Paradise. I will pray to God for you. I hope that ere long you will follow in my footsteps. "He repeated such words several times, although he was not aware that the wife had also been condemned to death.

The little company marched in solemn procession to the room chosen for the execution. At the head was one of the catechists bearing a crucifix, while the two others carried lighted candles. The martyr followed, holding the hands of his wife and mother. Then came the executioner with three attendants, and last of all, the household servants.

Arrived at the place where he was to die, Takeda first prostrated himself before an image of Christ and then took the appointed seat on the mats. Opposite him was the catechist with the crucifix, and on each side was one of those that held the candles. The three women sat a little behind him. Once more they repeated the Confession, the Paternosters, and the Aves. As they finished their devotions, a soldier, who had previously denied the faith, came in to pay his respects to the martyr, who obtained from him a promise of repentance. After Takeda had given his reliquary to Joanna and his chaplet to Inez, he loosened his robe and bent forward to receive the fatal blow. As the head fell upon the mats, one of the catechists, following the form that Japanese etiquette prescribes for taking up anything deserving of honour, raised it reverently as though about to put it on his own head. The mother then placed her hand caressingly on the severed head, saying: "Oh, my fortunate son, you have been deemed worthy to give your life for God's service. How blessed am I, sinful woman though I am, that I should be the mother of a martyr and that I can offer as a sacrifice this my only son, for whom during these many years I have so lovingly cared. "The wife also venerated the relic as though it were a sacred object, showing herself no less heroic than her mother-in-law.

In accordance with Kato's orders, the head was sent to Kumamoto that it might be exposed in a public place beside that of John Minami. The body was buried in Yatsushiro, but soon after was transferred to Nagasaki, that it might be placed in the church of the Jesuits.

Later in the day of Takeda's martyrdom, the two women, together with the wife and adopted son of Minami, were taken to the execution ground and there crucified. The corpses were left hanging on the crosses for a whole year in order that they might serve as a warning to the Christians. For some time, however, the believers were left unmolested, except that the three catechists were thrown into prison. The executioner who had beheaded Simon and superintended the crucifixion of the women, had been so much moved by their conduct that he soon after went to Nagasaki to ask that the missionaries would teach him the religion that enabled its followers to meet death with such joy and courage. On the day of his baptism he presented to the Bishop the sword with which Takeda had been beheaded. On his return to Yatsushiro, attempts were made to bring him back to his former religion. The next year he was banished and went to Nagasaki, whence a little later he removed to Siam.

An investigation of the complaints brought by the merchants of Kyoto against the quality of goods received from the Portuguese led in 1604 to the disgrace of Terasawa, the Governor of Nagasaki. He was replaced by a commission of five persons who were all Christians. Terasawa now changed the policy that he had recently adopted in Amakusa. He destroyed all but two of the churches, exiled some of his Christian retainers, confiscated their goods, and in other ways showed his hatred of their religion, until at last the fear that voluntary exile would seriously weaken his forces led him to desist.

In the suburbs of Nagasaki there had sprung up a new and flourishing settlement. In 1604 Ieyasu annexed it to the Imperial city, thus seriously lessening the revenues of Omura, to which it had previously belonged. The Daimyo considered that in some way the Jesuits were responsible for the change, and he took his revenge by apostatising.

In 1605 Ieyasu, then sixty-three years old, caused his son, Hidetada, twenty-six years of age, to be appointed Shogun in his place. His purpose was evidently to secure the office in the Tokugawa family. Ieyasu kept the real power in his own hands until his death eleven years later \(1616\). He caused a new castle to be built at Shizuoka, which he made his chief residence, though he often went to Kyoto, Osaka, and Yedo. This last city was the residence of the Shogun, and there too the daimyos built mansions in which they spent part of each year, while during their visits to their own domains their wives and children remained in Yedo as hostages. It will be seen that this was a great step towards establishing the centralised system that for the next two and a half centuries gave such power to the Tokugawa Shoguns.

For some time neither the nominal Shogun nor the actual possessor of power showed any inclination to annoy the Christians. The missionaries that from time to time obtained audiences with them were graciously received. The erection of churches and hospitals was permitted. Some of Ieyasu's own retainers publicly professed their belief in Christianity. In 1606, it is true, at the request of Yodogimi, Hideyori's mother, who was disturbed by the baptism of some of her relatives, the following edict was published:

"His Highness, having learned that several persons have embraced the doctrines and the religion of the Fathers, is exceedingly displeased at this infraction of the edicts. His Highness makes it known that he enjoins his servants, the nobles, and the ladies of the Household to observe the preceding law, and declares that in future the said servants and vassals must take great pains not to embrace the religion of the Fathers. Those that have accepted it must adopt another religion in its place."

It was evident, however, that there was no serious intention to enforce this order, which was issued merely to satisfy Yodogimi.

When, in 1606, Bishop Çerqueira went in ecclesiastical dress to pay his respects to Ieyasu, the latter also put on his ceremonial robes to show due honour to his guest, who was permitted to have his litter carried to the interior of the palace, a privilege usually reserved for lords of the highest rank. The next year Father Paez, the Vice-Provincial of the Jesuits, went with five others to Shizuoka. They were well received by Ieyasu and invited by him to visit the newly discovered silver mines in Izu. Hidetada also welcomed them in Yedo. On his journey back to Nagasaki, Paez waited upon Hideyori, thus giving great pleasure to Yodogimi, who from this time became less opposed to Christianity. In after years the missionaries frequently received subsidies from her. The missionaries were gradually extending their operations into remote provinces and the number of believers was increasing in all parts of the country, except where persecutions carried on by a few daimyos were causing defection and exile, or where the apostasy of feudal lords that had once been numbered among the Christians influenced their followers to return to the old religions.

The scientific and mechanical knowledge possessed by the missionaries helped them to gain the esteem of the upper classes. Hidetada asked that one of the Jesuits who understood clock-making might reside in Yedo, Feudal lords and other visitors to Kyoto were eager to see the astronomical instruments that showed the movements of the earth and planets. The missionaries improved the opportunities that were thus afforded for throwing ridicule upon the fanciful cosmogony taught by the Buddhists. The visitors, on seeing so much knowledge concerning mathematical and astronomical subjects, were more inclined to give respectful attention to what was said concerning religion. Even the Mikado asked the missionaries to come to his Palace and exhibit their wonderful instruments.

Ieyasu was more interested in commerce than in science. The favour he showed the missionaries was due to the belief that through them he could retain and increase foreign trade. Yet, as we have seen, he did not wish that this commerce should be monopolised by the Portuguese. He had tried to foster that with the Philippines. It was not merely for the sake of trade, however, that Ieyasu sought to have relations with the Spaniards. As has already been stated, he had asked for shipwrights and for experts who could help him to develop the mines that he had recently opened. The eagerness once shown by the Spaniards to share the profitable trade of the Portuguese had so far abated that they did not avail themselves of these opportunities. One reason may have been that their attention was being more drawn at that time towards the Spice Islands. Moreover, their experiences with the Japanese did not incline them to be very favourable to the nation. The *San Felipe,* driven on the coast of Tosa in 1596, had been confiscated, as has already been related. In 1602 another storm-tossed ship, seeking refuge in a harbour of the same province, was surrounded by guard-boats and escaped only by opening fire upon them. Though Ieyasu issued orders that such ships should thereafter be free from molestation, the merchants could not quickly forget these experiences. Many Japanese had gone to the Philippines, where they gained the reputation of being turbulent disturbers of the peace. In a despatch sent to the Spanish Governor in 1605, Ieyasu asked that these people should not be allowed to return to Japan. They were said to number fifteen thousand, and that same year they had been engaged in a quarrel with the Spaniards, which was kept from becoming serious by the intervention of a priest. In 1608 the Japanese residing in Manila engaged in a riot that had to be put down by force of arms. The Spaniards feared that the Japanese, if taught how to build European ships, would use these in piratical or military movements against the Philippines.

Two ships sent out by the Dutch East India Company reached Japan in July, 1609, and the kindness that the Daimyo of Hirado had shown to the Hollanders, who had been Will Adams's companions, was now requited by having that city chosen as the place for a new factory that was established by their countrymen.

Not quite two months after the arrival of the Dutch, two Spanish vessels on their way from Manila to Mexico were wrecked, one on the coast of Bungo, the other on the coast of Awa, about forty miles from Yedo. Among the passengers saved from the latter was Don Rodrigo Vivero, who had just finished a short term of service as acting Governor of the Philippines. Being taken to Yedo and afterwards to Shizuoka, he was treated with great honour by both Hidetada and Ieyasu. He took the opportunity to present three requests:

1.  That Christian priests of different orders who came to Japan should be protected and have the free use of their houses and churches.

2.  That an alliance between the Shogun and the King of Spain be confirmed.

3.  That, as an attestation to this alliance, the Hollanders should be expelled, since they were the sworn enemies of the Spaniards, and the worst kind of pirates.

Ieyasu assented to the first two propositions; but, while thanking Vivero for making him acquainted with the true character of the Hollanders, he declared that he could not now withdraw the permission he had given for their residence in Japan. He offered to let Vivero have for his conveyance to Mexico one of the vessels that Adams had built in European style, and asked him to get the King of Spain to send out fifty experienced mining engineers who could teach the Japanese the best methods of working mines and extracting precious metals from the ore.

Vivero said that, before deciding what to do, he wished to visit Bungo and see if the vessel that had been driven ashore there could not be made seaworthy. Apparently he found it injured beyond repair, for he soon returned to take the ship built by Adams. He now proposed to Ieyasu that, if miners were sent from Spain, one-half of the metals extracted should belong to them, one-fourth to Ieyasu, and one-fourth to the King of Spain. The King should be allowed to have his agents in Japan to look after his interests in the mine, and these might bring with them members of different religious orders, who should be permitted to have churches and to conduct public services. Furthermore, Spanish ships coming to Japan should be protected from harm. If the King wished to construct war vessels or merchant ships in any of the ports of Japan, or if munitions of war or provisions were wanted for the Spanish fortresses in the East, the King's agents should be permitted to superintend operations and to make purchases at current prices. If an ambassador should be sent to Japan, he should be received with all the honours due to one who represented so great a monarch. A treaty incorporating these points was concluded July 4, 1610. Ieyasu, however, refused to grant the repeated request for the expulsion of the Hollanders.

To show his sincerity, Ieyasu decided that he would send an ambassador bearing rich presents to King Philip and to the Viceroy of New Spain. In response to his request that Vivero would choose one of the missionaries to be the ambassador, Father Munoz was selected. The despatches and presents were put in the care of Vivero himself, to whom were also given four thousand ducats for fitting up the vessel in which he and Munoz set sail, August J, 1610.

Meanwhile the relations with the Portuguese were becoming more strained. A Japanese vessel on its return voyage from Cambodia wintered in Macao. A quarrel that arose between its crew and the Portuguese developed into a fight in which many were wounded and some killed. Pessoa, the Portuguese Governor, quelled the disturbance and made the Japanese sign a document in which they acknowledged that the blame lay entirely with them. On returning to their own land, they made loud complaints that they had been treated with great injustice. The next January \(1610\) Pessoa came to Nagasaki in command of the annual ship, La Madre *de Dios,* Ieyasu sent orders to the Daimyo of Arima that he should seize the vessel and take Pessoa, alive or dead. The ship was therefore surrounded by a flotilla of boats carrying more than twelve hundred men. For three days a fierce fight was carried on. Finally Pessoa set fire to the magazine. The vessel, with a cargo valued at a million ducats, sank beneath the waves, and the few Portuguese who were not destroyed with the ship were massacred. As this disaster brought to the Jesuits the loss of their subsidy for two years, they were in such great financial straits that they were obliged to close their seminary and also to send home the pupils that were being educated in the residences of the missionaries.

The Portuguese in Macao were in consternation when news of this event reached them. They finally decided to send an embassy to Ieyasu carrying rich presents, offering excuses for what had been done at Macao, requesting that trade might be continued, and asking that compensation should be given for the loss of their ship and cargo. Ieyasu was not inclined to do much more than accept the gifts. He gave no definite answer to the requests. He felt more independent of the Portuguese merchants because of other channels of trade that were being opened. The Dutch had promised to send ships every year, and though a defeat of the fleet of which they formed a part prevented the coming of those that were due in 1610, one reached Hirado in July, 1611, about a month before the embassy from Macao met Ieyasu. Another embassy came from Manila, and moreover a vessel had just arrived from New Spain bringing the Viceroy's ambassador, Ñuño de Sotomayor, to return thanks for the favours shown to Vivero and to present a new set of proposals as follows:

1.  That Spaniards be allowed to build in Japan such ships and as many as they might desire.

2.  That their pilots should be permitted to survey the coasts and harbours of japan.

3.  That the Shogun should prohibit the trade of the Hollanders, in which case the King of Spain would send men-of-war to Japan to burn their ships.

4.  That when Spanish vessels came to Japan they should not be subjected to search and should be free to sell their goods to whomsoever they pleased.

Spanish pride came in collision with that of the Japanese and made the conduct of this last ambassador displeasing to Ieyasu. Sotomayor was told that he must kneel on both knees while in the presence of Ieyasu and remain with hands and head to the floor until bidden to rise. To this he objected and was finally allowed to follow the etiquette of Spain. Three friars were with the ambassador during the interview. Whenever they spoke to him, he made a low obeisance in order to show the respect that he had for their holy office. He says that this made a great impression on Ieyasu and his counsellors.

On St. John's day the ambassador with his escort attended mass; his object, as he says, being both to honour the saint and to give the Japanese an example of attendance at church and of respect for the priesthood. On his way to the convent where the service was held he was met by the powerful Daimyo of Oshiu, Date Masamune, whose name will appear later in this history. As soon as Date saw the ambassador he dismounted and sent a messenger to ask that the Spanish soldiers would discharge their firearms, as he wished to see and hear them. When this was done, many of the horses in the Daimyo's train were so frightened that they threw their riders, much to the amusement of the onlookers. Afterwards, at the elevation of the Host, there was another discharge of musketry and the royal standard was lowered at the foot of the altar.\*

With the exception of that concerning the Hollanders, the requests presented by Sotomayor were granted. When in accordance with the second of these the Spaniards came the next year \(1612\) and began to make soundings along the coast, Ieyasu's suspicions were aroused. Will Adams was his trusted authority in all matters concerning European customs and it is probable that when his advice was asked, he replied, as is asserted by Roman Catholic historians, that, since in the West it would be considered an act of hostility for one nation to take soundings in the harbours of another there was good reason to suppose that the Spaniards had designs upon Japan, the missionaries \(one of whom, Sotelo, had come with Sotomayor and was now on the ship engaged in the surveys\) being emissaries of the King and employed to seduce the people from their rightful allegiance. Since Spaniards and Portuguese were subjects of the same monarch, care should be taken to guard against the machinations of each

An end was put to the survey and the captain of the ship was told that, though merchants would still be welcomed, no more missionaries were to be brought to Japan. It was at this time that Ieyasu began to take active measures in opposition to Christianity Before describing these it will be well to retrace our steps in order to consider the conditions of the churches from 1605 to 1612. Pagés gives the number of Christians at the former date as. 750,000; but it will be remembered that Bishop Çerqueira in 1603 put the number of Christians under pastoral care at 200, 000. The adult baptisms administered by the Jesuits in 1605 numbered 5, 430; in 1606, 7,950; in 1607, 7,000; and after that until the general persecution arose, such baptisms averaged about 4, 000 a year. There are no reliable statistics for the other orders.

The daimyos were allowed to deal as they pleased with the Christians in their own domains. Kato Kiyomasa in Higo and Mori in the western part of Hondo were the most severe in their measures. No missionaries were permitted to enter their territories openly and many ways were found for annoying those Christians that would not give up their faith. In a few cases those that stood firm were put to death.

In 1608 the baptism of a prominent man in Satsuma aroused the active opposition of the Buddhist priests against the Dominicans. The Daimyo, to whom the priests appealed, was already vexed that the presence of the missionaries had not brought any ships from Manila to his ports. He told Father Moralez, the Superior, that Ieyasu was complaining because none of the Dominicans had gone to pay their respects to him, and he urged that some one be sent at once. Accordingly Moralez set out for Kyoto, where he was well received by Ieyasu. In his absence the Daimyo issued orders that the Christians must give up their faith. They were also told that they must not carry any food to the missionaries, and these were prohibited from leaving their residences. For some time the only means the latter had for communicating with the outside world was by means of a leper, who on account of his disease could go back and forth without exciting suspicion. When Moralez returned the next spring, he and his associates were ordered to leave Satsuma. He at once dismantled the church and, taking with him the inmates of the leper hospital, sought shelter in Nagasaki.

Nagasaki, which Pagés describes as being "all Christian and governed by the Bishop," was still the headquarters of the Jesuits. The merchants that came thither from all parts of the country carried back to their homes Christian books and reports of what they had heard and seen in the churches. The presence of many exiles who had been driven by persecution from their own homes greatly increased the burden of the missionaries, especially when their supplies were cut short by the delay of the annual ship from Macao. The Japanese Christians, however, showed themselves very charitable and ready to do what they could for their brethren in distress. Pagés praises them for being also so "very charitable towards the dead" that they would sometimes tear off their clothes in order to pay for the celebration of masses in behalf of departed friends.

In 1611, when news reached Japan that the Pope had two years previously issued a Bull declaring the beatification of Ignatius Loyola, the Jesuits of Nagasaki arranged for a great festival in honour of the founder of their Society. The Bishop officiated pontifically at a vesper service. The vocal and instrumental music was such that a hearer "might have thought himself in Europe." There was also a solemn procession through the streets of the city. The Bishop, shaded by a canopy, carried a piece of the true Cross and some relics of Loyola. Then came the priests, the lay brothers, and the pupils of the seminary, all chanting psalms to an instrumental accompaniment. The members of various confraternities carried torches ornamented with flowers. The heathen governor of the city was "so much impressed as to declare that, if he had foreseen there was to be such a beautiful ceremony, he would have had the streets decorated and would have ordered a platform to be erected for himself so that he might at leisure contemplate all the marvellous features of the procession." The next day there was a pontifical mass and two panegyrics, one in Japanese and the other in Portuguese.

The possibility of having such a festival shows how strong a position Christianity held in Nagasaki before the breaking out of the persecutions that were soon to desolate the city and to drive out not only the missionaries but also the Portuguese and Spanish merchants who had built up the trade on which its prosperity depended.

It was afterwards believed that the coming troubles were presaged by divine signs sent to strengthen the Christians for the trials they would soon have to endure. Near the close of the year 1611, a neophyte who was hewing the trunk of a tree found a black cross plainly marked upon the white wood. The arms of the cross and the title were of the proper proportion, while the lower part of the figure was shaped like a sword. Many Christians came to see the wonder. It is asserted that one of them who had long been ill was immediately healed by drinking a cup of water in which a chip of the tree had been placed. Other cures were effected in a similar way. When the matter came to the ear of the Bishop, he had the cross brought to Nagasaki, examined into the alleged facts, and then pronounced the cross to be truly miraculous. A public service was held in which a discourse was preached telling of the discovery of this cross and the miracles that had been wrought by it. A procession was formed, headed by the Vice-Provincial of the Jesuits carrying the sacred object, while the Bishop, the missionaries, and the principal men of the city followed after. The cross was exposed on the altar for the remainder of the day and afterwards was carefully preserved, A similar cross was found a few months later in a tree that grew on land connected with the residence of the Jesuits. Its miraculous character, as in the case of the other, was attested by the Bishop. According to Roman Catholic histories, similar crosses were found at various times in different parts of Japan; and there are frequent references to other marvels.

The change in Ieyasu's attitude toward Christianity began to manifest itself in 1612. Mention has already been made of the way his suspicions were aroused that year by the soundings that the Spaniards made along the coast. His displeasure was also excited against a Christian named Okamoto Daihachi, the secretary of an officer who was practically Ieyasu's prime minister and his chief adviser in matters concerning the distribution of territory among the feudal lords. The Daimyo of Arima, desiring to have certain lands restored to his domains, had bribed Okamoto to aid him. The secretary pretended to do this and indulged in considerable sharp practice that finally became known to Ieyasu. The Daimyo was exiled and afterwards put to death, while his lands were allowed to remain in the hands of his son, who had given information against the father. Okamoto was sentenced to be burned alive. The fact that both of the offenders were adherents of Christianity increased the prejudices of Ieyasu against the religion. He exiled some of the believers and forbade his retainers to become Christians.

Many of the feudal lords imitated the example thus set before them. In that one year the Jesuits lost eighty-six churches and residences. Other orders suffered in a similar way. The Franciscan church in Yedo, though it had been erected by the express permission of the Shogun, was destroyed. Itakura, the Shogun's representative in Kyoto, was friendly to the Christians and gave the missionaries permission to remain and to receive believers in their houses. At his request, the Franciscans demolished a church that had been erected without his authorisation. By means of bribes the Jesuits were able to save several of their buildings.

The young Daimyo of Arima openly abjured his faith and ordered his subjects to do the same. Some yielded; others prepared for exile or death. The Jesuit Fathers were kept busily employed in hearing confessions and strengthening the faith of those that might ere long be called upon to suffer. The next year \(1613\) persecution in Arima became violent. The churches were demolished, the religious teachers driven out, and many Christians sent into exile. More severe measures followed. A prominent believer, previously banished from two other provinces and now resisting all attempts to make him apostatise, was invited to a feast given by a high official. In the midst of the repast a sword was placed before him. Knowing very well what this signified, he raised it respectfully to his head as is done by Japanese when receiving anything worthy of honour, examined it carefully, praised the workmanship, and handed it over to the officer, who at once cut him down. His brother was slain in a similar manner. Afterwards their mother and the two children of the first victim were beheaded.

The Christians organised Confraternities of Martyrdom to strengthen themselves by prayers, exhortations, and austerities. The children, in imitation of their elders, formed societies of their own, and we are told that they often used their scourges until the blood flowed.

The Daimyo put forth every exertion to obtain the apostasy of eight of his principal officers. He even went so far as to quote Scripture in favour of such yielding to the necessity of the times, saying with tears in his eyes that St. Peter had denied his Lord not only once but three times and yet had obtained pardon, and they ought not to be more obstinate than the great Disciple. Five yielded for a time, The other three were condemned to be burned with their families at the stake. Thereupon, four of those that had fallen repented and asked to be included in the condemnation, since they were Christians at heart. As no one would listen to them, they sent a declaration of their faith to the Buddhist priest that had presided at a ceremony in which they called on the name of Amida Buddha. The execution of the others with their wives and children took place October 7, 1613. Those condemned to die were clad in festal robes sent to them by one of the confraternities, Each of the martyrs held in one hand a lighted candle and in the other a rosary; he was attended by two of his fellow-believers. The victims were bound to stakes and surrounded by fagots. The president of the united confraternities erected in sight of the martyrs a large image representing the Saviour bound to the column where He was scourged. All the Christians joined in chanting the Creeds, the Paternoster, and the Ave Maria. When the cords that bound one of the children burned away, he went to his mother, who said to him: "Look up to heaven. "He died while still clinging to her. The charred remains of the bodies of the martyrs were taken to Nagasaki for burial in the Jesuits' cemetery.

In most other parts of the country the persecution lagged during 1613. Ieyasu's hesitancy about cutting off commerce with Macao and the Philippines doubtless restrained him from active measures. He and Hidetada received with the usual marks of favour the envoys sent by the Bishop and the Provincial of the Jesuits.

The Franciscans, though they had been driven out from Kyoto the previous year, were left undisturbed in Fushimi and Osaka. The Jesuits were in those cities and also in Kyoto. It is said that the Mikado's aunt, who was the abbess of two Buddhist nunneries, came with her mother and sister to hear them preach, and all three would have asked for baptism had it not been for the restraints put upon them by their position. In Osaka, Hideyori and his mother were showing much favour to the Jesuits.

In August, persecution began in Yedo. Father Sotelo, after the destruction of the Franciscan church a year before, had built a small house and oratory on land connected with the hospital for lepers. There he held services for the benefit of any believers that ventured to attend. This reached the ears of the Shogun, who at once ordered a vigorous search for Christians to be made in Yedo and its suburbs. Those that were discovered, including many lepers from the hospital, were thrown into prison. Twenty-two of them were soon put to death, Sotelo himself was arrested, but was released on the intercession of Date Masamune, a daimyo who possessed large domains in northeastern Japan and who now took the priest to Sendai, his capital.

At this point it will be well to consider one of the most remarkable episodes connected with the political and religious history of this period. Father Sotelo, a Spaniard of noble birth, had come with other Franciscans to Japan in 1608. Four years later he aided Vivero in conducting negotiations with Ieyasu, and he was at first appointed to go as the latter's envoy to Mexico and Spain. Ill health, however, led to his being replaced by Munoz. Sotelo had become intensely interested in plans for promoting commerce with Spain by way of Mexico. He believed that this could be made a great aid to the evangelisation of the Japanese. In 1611, when Sotomayor came as the envoy of the Viceroy of Mexico,\* Sotelo again took a prominent part in the negotiations. He was on board the vessel that made soundings along the coast of Japan, and shortly afterward \(October 12 1612\), having been intrusted with a letter from Hidetada to the King of Spain, set sail from Uraga with a number of Japanese. The vessel was wrecked the first morning after leaving port, and it was subsequent to this failure that Sotelo established himself in the leper hospital at Yedo.

He had previously become acquainted with the great Sendai Daimyo. Date Masamune was one of the most enterprising men of his day. He did much for the advancement of commerce, agriculture, and forestry. Extensive canals were planned by him and partly excavated. As is shown by his statue at Matsushima, he had only one good eye; but it was commonly said that he could see more with this one than most persons could with two. Sotelo, who had managed to get into his good graces, excited his interest in plans for establishing commercial relations with Mexico and Spain. According to a Japanese authority, Sotelo wrote a letter to Date proposing that an embassy be sent to these countries, and the Daimyo promised to furnish the necessary men and means.\* It was probably while these negotiations were being carried on that Sotelo was arrested and by Date's intercession was soon released. That the favour was so readily granted may have been owing to Ieyasu's interest in the project, for we find that he sent some of his officials to take part in the preparations. Pagés says that in Europe, Sotelo claimed to represent the Emperor \[Shogun\] and that he bore an "Imperial letter" to the King of Spain; but this is probably a mistake, or else is to be explained on the supposition that he had kept the letter entrusted to him five years before, and at this late date took the opportunity to deliver it.

Sotelo's plans were not regarded with favour by the Jesuits nor even by his own order. It is asserted that his superiors had gravely censured him for his unsuccessful attempt in 1612, One reason for this and for the opposition afterwards encountered by Sotelo was that trade between Japan and Mexico would be against the interests of the Philippines and contrary to special privileges granted to them. Spanish colonies, with the one exception of that at Manila, were forbidden to trade with foreign nations, and most of them were also prohibited from trading with one another. All their commerce must be carried on through the port of Seville in Spain itself. Special privileges given to Manila allowed its merchants to trade with China, Japan, and the Spanish colonies of America. It is easy to see why they would not look with favour on any plans for direct commerce between Spain and Japan by way of Mexico, while that of Mexico with Japan would be contrary to the Spanish policy, and illegal unless the Spanish King should remove the prohibition, as Sotelo hoped he might be induced to do if the Pope's intercession could be secured. The Franciscans in Japan had come from the Philippines, and their relations with the merchants of those islands account for their opposition to Sotelo.

A letter written in 1615 by Bishop Çerqueira to the General of the Jesuits says: "The Jesuit Fathers here did all they could these last few months to prevent not only the embassy, but also the voyage of Father Sotelo to New Spain. They worked hard, though without success, to get him into their hands and send him to Manila. The reason for this opposition was declared to be that if, as Sotelo desired, a large band of missionaries should come to Date's dominions, "great inconvenience may be expected to come, not only to the Christians, but also to the Franciscans themselves for having taken a prominent part in the business." Moreover fear was expressed that "should any further mission of the Franciscans or any other order come here, it might greatly excite the King \[Ieyasu\] against them and against Masamune, whose real object in wishing the mission in his estates would then become too evident. As the King, for reasons we have before given you, is already very suspicious of the Spaniards, he may be led to think there is some ominous alliance between them and Masamune." The Bishop says that he has written to the King of Spam, urging him to use great prudence in connection with the embassy. In addition to the reasons for Cerqueira's opposition that are stated in his letter, there were those that arose from the ill-feeling that existed between the different orders. This would have been greatly increased if the Jesuits had known that the letters to be carried by Sotelo asked for his appointment as bishop for northeastern Japan.

With Sotelo was associated as Date's representative one of his retainers named Hashikura Rokuemon, To their care were committed letters from Date to the Pope, to the King of Spain, and to others. The one addressed to the Pope was as follows:

"I, Idate\* Masamune, King of Oshu in the Empire of Japan, while kissing with profound submission and reverence the feet of Pope Paul V., the great, the universal, and the most holy Father of the world, say as a suppliant:

"When Father Louis Sotelo, a monk of the order of St. Francis, came to my kingdom and preached the Christian faith, he visited me. I have learned from him about that religion and he has explained to me many mysteries concerning the rites and ceremonies of the Christians. I have received these teachings into my heart, and upon examining them have seen that they are true and salutary. I would not hesitate to profess them openly if certain affairs had not hindered and invincible reasons prevented my doing so. But, although personally I am for the time being held back, I desire that my subjects at least shall become Christians. That this may be brought about, I beseech Your Holiness to send me monks of the order of St. Francis, called of the Observance. These I especially esteem and reverence. May Your Highness grant to accord to them in abundance licenses, favours, and all else that will contribute to their success. On my part, from the moment they enter my domains, I will never cease to protect them. I will help them by erecting monasteries and in all other possible ways. I likewise earnestly entreat that you will dispose, govern, and institute in my kingdom everything that you judge useful for the propagation of God's holy law, and especially I request that you will designate and appoint some grand prelate,† under whose direction and zeal I doubt not that all the inhabitants will quickly be converted to Christianity. You need not have any anxiety concerning their expenses and revenues, for I wish to assume for myself the whole responsibility and care for seeing that ample provision is made.

"For these reasons I am sending to you Father Louis Sotelo as my ambassador, from whom you will be able to inquire at pleasure concerning my intentions, for he well understands my views upon the above-mentioned matters. I beseech Your Holiness to lend a favourable ear to him and to receive him with honour. He will be accompanied by a noble gentleman of my house by the name of Hashikura Rokuemon, who has likewise been made my ambassador so that the two may go to the very holy Roman Court as bearers of my homage and obedience, and there kiss your sacred feet. If by chance the aforesaid Father Louis Sotelo should die on the voyage, I wish that such other person as he may have designated be admitted to your presence as my ambassador the same as though he were there himself.

"I have also learned that my kingdom is not far from the states of New Spain, which form part of the dominions of Philip, the very powerful King of Spain, Desiring therefore to enter into relations with him and with his Christian states, I wish to enjoy his friendship, which I certainly hope to obtain through the intervention of your authority, I therefore humbly pray that Your Highness will undertake and accomplish this, and so much the more as these states are on the road necessarily to be taken by the monks that will be sent by you into this kingdom.

"Above all pray to Almighty God that I may be able to attain to His friendship. If you know of anything in our country that would be agreeable and acceptable to you, let Your Highness command and we will do all in our power to satisfy your wish. For the present, since they come from a distant country, permit me to offer with reverence and respect a few slight gifts from Japan, For the rest, we rely upon the aforesaid Father Sotelo and Rokuemon, and we ratify all that they arrange and conclude in our name.

"From our city and court of Sendai in the eighteenth year of the Keicho era, the fourth day of the ninth month, that is, October 6, in the year of Salvation 1613.
> > > > > > "Matsudaira Mutsu no Kami, Idate Masamune."\*
Attached to the letter addressed to the Spanish King were the following propositions and promises:

"1. I am willing that my people should become Christians. Send me therefore some Fathers who belong to the order of St. Francis. I will treat them kindly.†

"2. Send Fathers every year. In the ships now despatched to Mexico I send some of the products of Japan. Hereafter please send for my use some goods made in your land.

"3. When my ships return, you can send in them people or goods without expense. Should my ships suffer damage, please give my men what is necessary for repairs.

"4. When ships on their way from the Philippines to New Spain come to this land, I will protect those on hoard. If ships are injured, I will supply whatever is necessary for repairs. In case it is necessary to rebuild the ships, I will take like care to provide what may be needed.

"5. When yon wish to build ships in my country, I will supply wood, iron, carpenters, and whatever else is needed.

"6. When ships come here from your country, I will allow them to trade freely and will treat the people kindly.

"7. When Spaniards come here to live, I will give them houses and other things. In case any of them commit a crime, I will refer the matter to their own chief and look to him for punishment of evil-doers.

"8. If the English and Dutch, who are your enemies, come here, I will not honour them. Sotelo will tell you in detail about this.

"9. Having once assented to these articles, our agreement should be perpetual."

Sotelo and Hashikura set sail October 21, 1613, from the small port of Tsukinoura, about forty miles from Sendai. In addition to some seventy persons directly connected with the embassy, there were a number of merchants, who laded the ship with screens, chests of drawers \(the *tansu* for which Sendai is still noted\), and other articles to be sold in Mexico, Acapulco was reached January 24, 1614, and the ambassadors went on to the city of Mexico, where they were received by the Viceroy with due honour. Sixty-eight of Hashikura's suite were there baptised. It was decided that his own baptism should be postponed until his arrival in Europe, As several months were spent in Mexico, it was not until October that the embassy reached Seville. This, as has been said, was the port through which passed all commerce with the colonies. Moreover, it was the birthplace of Sotelo, and the city received him and his associates with the greatest enthusiasm. In Madrid they were welcomed by the King, and there, February 17, 1615, Hashikura was baptised. Three of his followers expressed a desire to become monks, but "this was opposed for prudential reasons."\*

In the Italian cities the embassy was honoured by a succession of magnificent fêtes. At Rome the ceremonies were similar to those witnessed thirty years before at the coming of the young men from Kyushu; though the Jesuits, by arousing a feeling of suspicion concerning the nature of the new embassy, caused some abatement in the warmth of the welcome. A despatch from the Venetian Ambassador at Rome speaks of Hashikura's reception by the Pope and mentions one speech that would be likely to make trouble if a similar report of it ever reached Ieyasu;

"A Franciscan monk made a very able exposition of the embassy and said that the King \[Date\] wanted a prelate to instruct him, and also a number of missionaries; that the King, being next in power and dignity to the Emperor \[Shogun\], would endeavour to supplant him and then would not only declare himself an obedient Christian to the Church of Rome but would afterwards compel all other princes in his country to be the same. Most of the people here in Rome think there are other interests at the bottom of this affair."

Pagés says that the Pope had some thought of appointing an archbishop and four bishops for Japan, and even of conferring on Sotelo the dignity of a cardinal. Such strong influence was brought against this that the Pope finally did not go beyond nominating Sotelo as Bishop of North Japan. It was probably because of the Jesuits and of the letters against Sotelo that came from the Philippines that Philip III. objected to having one of his subjects created bishop before the royal assent had been obtained. He succeeded in having the appointment withdrawn.

In 1617 Sotelo and Hashikura, returning towards Japan, reached Acapulco and from there went to Manila, where Sotelo fell into the power of his enemies. In accordance with orders from the Council for the Indies, his papers were taken from him and he was not allowed to proceed to Japan. It was not until 1620 that Hashikura, as will afterwards be related, reached Sendai, where Date was then proving to be anything but a patron of Christianity.

Ieyasu's sixth son, Tadateru, became disaffected with his father and was suspected of having plans for supplanting his brother in the shogunate. It is thought that Date, who was Tadateru's father-in-law, may have had something to do with the plot. If Ieyasu had learned the contents of the Sendai Daimyo's letter to the Pope and what was said at Hashikura's reception, he might well have thought there was need for scrutinising sharply the conduct of his vassal and the work of the missionaries. Date's later attitude toward Christianity may have been dictated in part by a desire to turn away the suspicion that had arisen against him.

Some Japanese books speak of another conspiracy whose discovery had much to do in increasing Ieyasu's suspicions against the Christians. A petty daimyo by the name of Okubo had been made superintendent of the gold and silver mines in the island of Sado. After his death, it was found that he had been guilty of financial irregularities. This led to a close scrutiny of his books and papers. It is alleged that several documents were found that showed that Okubo had been in communication with foreigners and had entered into an arrangement with them by which they would furnish troops to aid in overthrowing the Shogun's power. Tadateru was more or less involved in this affair. The discovery of the plot led to the punishment of several persons, among whom was a brother of Takayama Ukon.

It is easy to see how the different events that have been narrated—such as the soundings made by the Spaniards, the trickery of Okamoto and Okubo \(especially if there is any foundation for the story that the latter's fellow-believers were involved in his schemes\), and the embassy sent by Date—were likely to make Ieyasu think that the missionaries and their followers ought to be closely watched. He had about him those that were ever ready to fan his suspicions by repeating the old charges and inventing new ones. In a letter written to the Pope by Carvalho, the Jesuit Provincial, he says that the chief reasons leading to the persecution were that the enemies of Christianity had persuaded Ieyasu that it taught its believers to hold in high honour those that disobeyed their feudal lords, and even to worship common criminals. These accusations, he said, were grounded on the veneration shown by the Christians for those who suffered death rather than obey the Lord of Arima when he commanded them to give up their faith, and on the fact that when a professing Christian had been executed for some crime, others knelt upon the ground in order that they might pray for him. When Ieyasu was told that the Christians worshipped criminals, he angrily exclaimed: "A religion teaching such things is devilish\!" and gave orders to the Governor of Nagasaki that he should expel all Christian teachers.

The Annual Letter of the Jesuits for 1614, quotes a letter that this Governor wrote to the Rector of Kyoto in which he said: "When Ieyasu heard that some of the Christians had gone to worship a citizen of Nagasaki named Jieobioe, who was executed for violating the law against the purchase of silver bullion, he said that it must be a diabolic religion that led its followers to worship persons executed for crime and also to venerate those that were burned or cut in pieces by order of their lords. Those that teach such a religion must be the most wicked of all men."

It is doubtless true also that the Dutch were only too willing to do their part in inciting Ieyasu to take action against their rivals. There was none too friendly a feeling between the different nations trading with Japan. We have seen how the Portuguese tried to shut out the Spaniards, how the Spaniards urged Ieyasu to drive away the Dutch, and how Will Adams said that the Spaniards were acting the part of enemies when they sounded the harbours of Japan. It is asserted that in 1611, the Dutch, in translating a letter sent to Ieyasu by Maurice of Nassau, took the liberty of changing its meaning so as to make it accuse the Spanish and Portuguese merchants of being engaged in plots with the missionaries and Japanese Christians.

The rivalry of the merchants found its counterpart in that between the different orders. This could not fail to be a source of weakness, and there are indications that in trying to further the interests of the Portuguese or Spanish traders, with whom they were in close relations, the missionaries increased the amount of suspicion that had arisen against themselves and against the merchants.

Apostates from Christianity were ready to foster the feeling against it. Thomas Araki, a Japanese priest who had been ordained at Rome, returned about 1605 to his own country and declared that while in Madrid he had discovered that Spain was using the missionaries to pave the way for the conquest of Japan. It was largely through his influence that the Daimyo of Omura was led to give up Christianity and become one of its persecutors. Japanese books tell of a native priest from Yatsushiro, Higo, who in 1611 told Ieyasu that the King of Spain every year devoted large sums to sending merchandise into lands as yet unconquered in order to help in gaining converts to Christianity. He declared that the missionaries sent hack annual reports telling how many persons they had succeeded in winning, and that valuable goods were distributed among them in proportion to their success in gaining converts. When a sufficient number of the people in any land had been made allies through their religious faith, possession was taken of the country and its precious metals were sent to Spain.

January 27, 1614, Ieyasu issued his celebrated decree against Christianity. After an introduction dealing with Chinese philosophy and Buddhism, it said:

"But Christians have come to Japan, not only sending their merchant vessels to exchange commodities, but also longing to disseminate an evil law and to overthrow right doctrine so that they may change the government of the country and obtain possession of the land. This is the germ of great disaster and must be crushed.

After speaking of the crimes condemned by Buddhism, the decree continues:

"The faction of the missionaries rebel against this dispensation; they disbelieve in the way of the gods, blaspheme the true law, violate rightdoing, and injure the good. If they see a condemned fellow, they run to him with joy, bow down to him, and do him reverence. This, they say, is the essence of their belief. If this is not an evil law. what is it? They truly are the enemies of the gods and of Buddha. If this be not speedily prohibited, the safety of the state will assuredly be hereafter imperilled; and if those who are charged with ordering its affairs do not put a stop to the evil, they will expose themselves to Heaven's rebuke.

"These must be instantly swept out, so that not an inch of soil remains to them in Japan on which to plant their feet, and if they refuse to obey this command, they shall pay the penalty."\*

To this decree were appended rules for the guidance of Buddhist priests, who were directed to examine into the orthodoxy of their parishioners. Among these rules are the following:

"Because the Christian law teaches that those who despise death can pass through fire without being burned, or be plunged into water without being drowned, and that those who die by shedding their own blood are saved, the law of the Empire is most strict. Therefore you must examine such as make light of death."

"To those who follow Christianity a daily allowance of seven cash is made from Dattan\(?\) Land in order to convert the Empire to Christianity. It is an evil law which injures the Country of the Gods, As the persons who follow these doctrines do not observe the law of Buddha, they object to paying contributions to their parish temples and dislike the establishment of the Buddhist law. Such you must examine."

". . . . By the help of their God, if they look in a mirror, they see the face of a saint; but if they have changed their religion, they appear as dogs."

"Although the parents for generations past may have belonged without the slightest doubt to one of the eight or nine Buddhist sects, it is impossible to be sure that the children may not in their hearts have been persuaded to join the evil law. The temple of the sect to which they belong must examine them."

"To every person in the Empire who clearly follows the true law a sect-certificate, authenticated by a seal, shall be given. *Samurai* shall put their seal in the certificate registry of the temple to which they belong. Those who cannot make a seal with blood shall send a certificate attested by a guarantee."\*

The daimyos received notice that they must send to Nagasaki all the missionaries living in their territories, that the churches must be destroyed, and that the Christians must be forced to give up their religion. Itakura, the Shogun's representative in Kyoto, was ordered to make out a list of the Christians living in that city. Father De Mattos at once sent his assistants from house to house that they might encourage the believers to stand firm. On the other hand, relatives and neighbours were beseeching them to renounce their faith or at least to conceal it. Though the whole number of believers in Kyoto is asserted to have been more than seven thousand, only four thousand of these were put upon the lists, and then, in order that Ieyasu might not be too much irritated, Itakura, who was friendly to the Christians, sent him the names of only sixteen hundred.

In February, the Jesuits in Kyoto were told that they must be taken to Nagasaki in order to be transported to their own countries. There were then fifteen members of the Society in the city, three of whom managed to conceal themselves. The others with some of their followers were put on boats and floated down the canal to Fushimi, where some Franciscans were added to their number. At Osaka they were joined by still others, so that there were seven boatloads, besides the two boatloads of soldiers sent to escort them as they were taken by sea to Nagasaki. There they found other missionaries and Japanese Christians brought from different parts of the country. Among the latter was Takayama Ukon. Since there were no ships ready to sail, their embarkation was delayed until October.

The tribulation through which they were passing ought to have united the hearts of those belonging to different orders; but, strange to say, it was at this time that the dissensions broke out with more virulence than ever. On the twentieth of February, Bishop Çerqueira died. Before his death he had asked Father Carvalho, a Jesuit, to care for the interests of the Church,\* and soon after this the seven Japanese secular priests had come to throw themselves at Carvalho's feet asking him to administer the bishopric until some one could be appointed by the Archbishop of Goa. This was not pleasing to the Franciscans and Dominicans, who, in addition to their jealousy of the Jesuits, were moved by a desire to have Japan under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Manila. They therefore got the secular priests to act with them, and chose a clerk in minor orders to be their notary for drawing up an act in which they declared the deposition of Carvalho. In his place they elected Father Moralez of the Dominican order. Carvalho was not ready to be set aside in this way. He affixed to the door of the church an edict in which he pronounced a censure against his opponents and excommunicated the notary. Moralez retorted by excommunicating Carvalho. For some reason the Vicar General of the Dominicans disapproved of these proceedings and ordered Moralez to desist. The Japanese Christians and the Portuguese residents of Nagasaki became involved in these dissensions, which continued long after the deportation of many that had taken a prominent part in them.

After the missionaries had been sent away from Kyoto, efforts were renewed to secure the apostasy of the Christians who remained. Itakura would gladly have left them in peace, but Okubo Tadachika, Daimyo of Odawara, who was under suspicion of being connected with the alleged plot of the Christians to overthrow Ieyasu and Hidetada, was sent to his assistance. Okubo, who supposed this to be Ieyasu's way of testing his sentiments, made the most of the opportunity to clear himself He posted a notice in which he said that, as all obstinate Christians were to be burned alive, those unwilling to give up their faith would do well to prepare the stakes to which they must be bound. Many of the Christians followed this order to the letter.

Some women who had taken vows of celibacy were living in a community under the care of Julia Naito, a sister of John Naito, the former Daimyo of Kameoka. Okubo had a number of them tied up in straw sacks, which were suspended on poles and carried through the city in order that the women might be subjected to the derision of the populace.

According to a Japanese account, Okuho destroyed the churches in Kyoto and put some sixty Christians to death. European histories do not mention the executions, but say, what is in accord with the Japanese account, that the persecution, after being carried on for eight or nine days with great vigour, was brought to a sudden end by the recall of Okubo, who was sent into exile. Apparently he had been sent to Kyoto in order that Ieyasu might in his absence gain easy possession of his castle in Odawara.

Nagasaki was still a Christian city. Its officers were little inclined to annoy believers or to put any restraint upon the missionaries, whose numbers were greatly increased by those that had been sent there for deportation. At first it was thought wise to desist from such public religious exercises as would attract attention. After a while, however, a different policy was adopted and the orders began to vie with one another in religious processions. The first of these was arranged about the end of April by the Franciscans. After their Superior had delivered a sermon, he washed and kissed the feet of twelve poor lepers. He then threw off the ecclesiastical robes that he had been wearing over a garment of sackcloth, sprinkled his head with ashes, took a large cross upon his shoulders, and had a boy lead him through the streets by a rope that was fastened about his neck. With him were the other Franciscans, scourging themselves until the blood flowed as they walked along the streets. Among the believers that joined the procession was Murayama Toan, the Deputy Governor.

The Dominicans chose the day of Pentecost for a similar service. Two thousand women dressed in white, but wearing dark veils, led the procession. They had crowns of thorns on their heads, and in their hands carried crucifixes and other sacred emblems. They were followed by eight thousand men who marched three abreast, the one in the middle carrying a lighted candle, while the two others scourged him and themselves. At the end of the procession was a large cross covered with a black veil.

The next day came the Augustinians, and shortly after, the Jesuits. These last exerted themselves to outdo all their predecessors. As a representation of the sufferings that they must be prepared to bear, some of the Christians were tied up in straw sacks, some carried great crosses on their shoulders, some were ranged in companies of eight or ten with their necks compressed between wooden planks, some had the upper part of their bodies enveloped with thorns over which they wore heavy reed mats that pressed the points into their flesh, while still others were bound to crosses and scourged by their companions who walked beside them.

From this time until October there was a constant succession of such spectacles. In some cases they were under the charge of missionaries; often they were arranged by the native Christians. Nagasaki was crowded with believers who came from other places to see the ceremonies and to receive the sacraments before their teachers should be sent out of the country.

The time drew near for deportation. All attempts at inducing Ieyasu to withdraw his orders had been unavailing. The month of October was occupied with many sad ceremonies. The Dominicans uprooted the two large crosses that stood before their cloister and in their cemetery. These with other sacred objects that could not be taken away nor concealed were burned so that they might not be left for the insults of heathen. The Jesuits dug up the relics of martyrs that had been deposited beneath their churches, and had them conveyed to a safe place. Many of the Christians disinterred the bones of their friends and hid them away. This was not a vain precaution, for afterwards, when the persecution became more severe, the Christian cemeteries were desecrated and the remains of those buried in them were insulted.

In some of the churches solemn services were held in which the lamps of the sanctuaries were extinguished and the altars dismantled, while the worshipers looked on with grief at what was being done. "It was like a scene from the Last Judgment."

The embarkation of the exiles took place on the seventh of November. Three small junks, in such poor condition as to be hardly seaworthy, were employed. One of these was sent to Manila. Among those on board were Takayama Ukon and John Naito with their families, Julia Naito with fourteen of her companions, two secular priests, and about thirty members of different orders. The other two vessels were ordered to go to Macao, taking seventy Jesuit priests and a number of Japanese Christians.

Not all of these persons actually left Japan, The Deputy Governor, Murayama Toan,\* whose son was one of the secular priests, was probably privy to a plan by which, when the junk hound for Manila had sailed about two leagues and had been freed from the guards, small boats put off from shore and took back two Dominicans, two Franciscans, and the two Japanese priests. Some of the Jesuits also escaped, and the number would have been greater if it had not been that by mistake too few boats were sent. Many of the persons that were carried to Manila and Macao soon found ways of returning disguised as merchants, sailors, or even as slaves. There also remained in concealment a number of missionaries who had not been found at the time their associates were deported. Some of the feudal lords showed little zeal in hunting them up or in taking action against the Christians. One of those in Tamba joined with his son in openly resisting the orders, an act of nullification to which Ieyasu is said "to have shut his eyes."

The exiles that went to Manila were given a magnificent reception. The Governor, the Bishop, members of the religious orders, nay, the whole Christian populace, united in doing them honour. A splendidly decorated galley was sent to meet the junk as it entered the harbour. The booming of cannon and the ringing of bells welcomed the exiles, who were taken in carriages to the cathedral, where a religious service was held. Takayama, the most illustrious of the company, died in February of the next year \(1615\). His funeral was attended by a great concourse. Many kissed his feet as those of a saint that had suffered much for his faith. The Governor, in the name of the Spanish King, assigned the rents of certain lands to his family. He was buried in the church of the Jesuits. Eleven years later, the body of John Naito was placed beside his. Some of their associates afterwards returned to Japan. The descendants of those that remained, together with those of later exiles, form no inconsiderable element of the mixed population now found in the Philippines.

One of the most active persecutors of the Christians was Hasegawa Sahioe, the chief Governor of Nagasaki. In that city he was somewhat restrained by various privileges that had been granted to the Portuguese, by fear of an insurrection, and by the apprehension that he might be blamed if his acts put an end to foreign commerce. He had for a long time desired to be put in possession of Arima. He had already been given some oversight of the apostate Daimyo of that fief and it was partly because of this that the persecutions there had been particularly severe. He now succeeded in getting that daimyo transferred to Hyuga, while he himself obtained the coveted territory. He determined to purge it from the hated religion. For this purpose he made use of a large force of soldiers from Satsuma and Hizen. He is said to have issued the following directions to his subordinates:

"The Christians desire death in order that they may be honoured as martyrs. Hence it is not desirable to slay them, but rather to prolong their lives, subjecting them to such severe punishments as will finally overcome their resistance. The most effective trial will be to enslave their women, sending the most beautiful of them to the houses of prostitution in Kyoto. If the people will renounce the religion of Christ, they shall be exempted from imposts and other obligations; moreover, Chinese ships will be induced to come to their ports for trade, and this will be for the great enrichment of the country."

As most of the Christians in Arima stood firm, arrests and persecutions soon began. Most of the soldiers that were sent to scour the country had little taste for attacking unarmed men, women, and children. In many cases, they sent warnings before them to the villages so that the inhabitants might escape to the mountains. The men from Satsuma soon reported that they could find no Christians in the section allotted to them. Not all the soldiers, however, were so indulgent. Many Christians were arrested and subjected to torments. Notwithstanding what Hasegawa had said about disappointing the desire of the Christians for martyrdom, he caused a number of them to be put to death.

After personally supervising these proceedings in Arima, Hasegawa returned with his soldiers to Nagasaki, where he threatened that he would compel all the Chris-bans to apostatise. It is asserted that an order from Ieyasu directed him not to cause any check to commerce by taking action before the arrival of the next Great Ship from Macao, and also to be careful not to adopt such methods as would excite the people to revolt. However that may have been, another reason for the temporary cessation of persecution was that Hasegawa and his soldiers were called to take part in Ieyasu's military operations against Hideyori.

The last great struggle, which was to establish the Tokugawa family firmly in the shogunate and to put an end to the hopes that Hideyoshi's son might recover the power his father had wished to bequeath him, was now beginning. Hideyori held the strongly fortified castle of Osaka. Many powerful lords remained faithful to his cause. In various ways Ieyasu had tried to involve him in undertakings that would diminish the treasure inherited from his father, and to increase the difficulties that the young man had found in asserting his claims. At last, when the time seemed propitious, Ieyasu found means for picking a quarrel that opened the way for laying siege to Osaka Castle. After a long struggle and as much through trickery as by good fighting it was captured June 4, 1615. Hideyori with some of his retainers committed *harakiri* in the innermost citadel, which was then set on fire.

A large proportion of the Christians had been inclined to favour Hideyori. Pagés says that because of the promises he had made, all the inhabitants of Nagasaki desired his triumph. We are not told what these promises were; but among the English and Dutch traders there was apprehension that, if Hideyori were victorious, the Spanish and Portuguese priests would obtain so much power that they themselves as heretics would be driven out of the country. It was believed by many that the missionaries stirred up Hideyori to oppose Ieyasu. Will Adams wrote:

"He mad warres with the Emperour allso by the Jessvits and Ffriers which mad his man Fiddeyat Samma belleeue he should be fauord with mirracles and wounders; but in fyne it proved to the contrari."  

One of Hideyori's prominent generals was a Christian named Akashi Morishige, who found that military necessities required the burning of about two hundred temples, including three of the most important in Osaka and Sakai, A son of Takayama Ukon with three hundred of his father's former retainers joined Hideyori's forces, as did sons of John Naito and Otomo Yoshishige, besides many Christian warriors who had been banished from their homes. We are told of six great banners that, in addition to the cross, had representations of Christ or of St. James, the patron saint of Spain. Some even bore ideographs signifying "The Great Protector of Spain." Moreover, five missionaries, together with a Japanese priest, the son of Murayama Toan, were in Hideyori's camp. It is asserted that this priest led a band of four hundred Christian warriors. He was slain; but the foreigners managed with great difficulty to escape. One of them, Father Porro, wrote a vivid description of the destruction of Osaka and of his own adventures. Two of the Christians had persuaded him to leave the castle and had brought him to the mansion of one of Ieyasu's followers, where it was thought he would be safe. While there, he saw the burning of the castle and city. A high wind increased the fury of the flames. The buildings of the mansion where he had found shelter caught fire one by one, so that he was forced to take refuge in a clump of bamboos. While there, he heard the confessions of several Christians and even baptised a new convert. The next morning a company of soldiers came up and threatened him with death. They stripped off most of his clothes, but finally let him go free. Making his way among the ruins of houses and the corpses of the slain, he reached the camp of Date Masamune, who had been among the besiegers. Porro says:

"I was noticed by a soldier who, thinking I might be one of the Fathers, called to me in a very respectful manner, led me to his tent, and said that in the present circumstances he would never consent to my going farther at the very evident risk of my life. I remained with him all that day. On the morrow, which was the fifth of June, my host started for Kyoto, while I, falling once more into extreme peril, took my way toward Masamune. I found this lord on the point of mounting his horse as he started for Kyoto. I explained briefly that I was a foreigner from the city of Nagasaki and that, having found myself in Osaka during the recent occurrences, I had been reduced to the sad condition in which he saw me. I asked that he would generously assist me to go to Morro and from thence to Nagasaki. Masamune replied through a page that he would have acceded to my request gladly and at once if I had not been a Christian."

This reply of Masamune is the more noticeable because it was just at this time that his ambassador Hashikura, after being specially welcomed in Mexico, was about to proceed to Europe, where he represented his master as ready to become the protector of the Christians. After this repulse, Porro passed on through other dangers until he found persons who treated him kindly, gave him clothing, and sent him on his way until he found shelter among believers.

Although many Christians were among the soldiers in Ieyasu's army, it is not strange that the presence among his enemies of religious teachers whose deportation he had ordered, and the prominent display of Christian emblems increased his dislike for the foreign religion. Will Adams wrote:

"The Emperour heering of these jessvets and friers being in the kastell with his ennemis, and still from tym to tym against hym, couminandeth all romische sorte of men to depart out of his countri, thear churches pulid dooun and burned."

There were reports that Hideyori was still alive and that he was being concealed by the Christians. The diary of Richard Cocks, who was in charge of the English factory at Hirado, makes frequent mention of these rumours. He tells of a search that was being made in all parts of Japan "to look out for such as escaped out of the fortress of Osekey when it was burned. Soe that prive enquirie was mad in all howses in Firando \[Hirado\] what strangers were lodged in eache howse, and true notis thereof geven to the justice. It is thought the padres at Langasaque \[Nagasaki\] and else where will be narrowly looked after."

During the contests in Osaka the church had a season of calm. There had remained in Japan twenty-nine Jesuits, six Franciscans, six Dominicans, and one Augustinian. Their numbers were increased by the secret return of some of those that had been banished. Disguised in various ways and travelling mostly by night, they went about the country visiting the sick, encouraging the faint-hearted, baptising children, and even gathering new converts. One of the Franciscans, assuming the garb of a soldier and mingling with those of Ieyasu's army, managed to get to Yedo itself. He lodged for a time in the leper hospital, which was kept up under the direction of one of its inmates, who belonged to a distinguished family. This seemed a safe retreat, for the lepers were so avoided by other people that it was unlikely any search would be made among them. He frequently made his way into the city, and for a short time lived in a house belonging to the retainer of a high officer. Finally he was arrested, as were also fifty of the lepers. The hospital itself was destroyed.

This missionary, with ten or twelve of the Christians, was confined in a single room so closely packed that any person wishing to sleep had to support himself by leaning against his neighbour. There were many other prisoners, and these were constantly quarrelling about the amount of space each could have and the length of time he could sleep. In summer it was so hot that objection was made to any person's wearing clothing, because he thus made those near him warmer. The missionary, as a special favour, was allowed to wear a thin garment, though at times he himself found it unendurable, The food was so scanty that many died for lack of nourishment. The Father was kept alive by food that outside Christians bribed the guards to give him. Many prisoners committed suicide. Others were murdered. Frequently the corpses were not removed for seven or eight days. All the prisoners soon became covered with frightful ulcers. In the midst of these horrors, the missionary was at first able to perform religious exercises with his fellow-Christians; but afterwards the prison received a rougher set of men, who put an end to preaching and the open performance of any sacred ministry. The missionary remained in the prison for more than a year, when he was released by the intercession of one of the Shogun's officers, who desired to conciliate the Spaniards so as to facilitate certain commercial enterprises.

### APPARENT EXTIRPATION 1616-1715
APPARENT EXTIRPATION OF CHRISTIANITY 1616-1715



IEYASU died June 1, 1616. This brought no relief to the Christians, for Hidetada was more violent against them than his father had ever been. Will Adams wrote:

"Now this yeear, 1616, the old Emperour died. His son raigneth in his place, and hee is more hot agaynste the romish relligion then his ffather wass: for he hath forbidden thorough all his domynions, on paine of death, none of his subjects to be romish christiane; which romish seckt to prevent everi wayes that he maye, he hath forbidden that no stranger merchant shall abid in any of the great citties."

On the death of Ieyasu, Richard Cocks, the English agent, thought it best to visit Yedo in order to pay his respects to the Shogun and to request a continuance of the commercial privileges hitherto enjoyed by the English. In a letter to the East India Company he wrote:

"The 5th day after I arrived at court our present was deliverd, and had audience with many favourable words, but could not get my dispach in above a month after; so that once I thought we should have lost all our pirivelegese, for the Councell sent unto us I think above twenty times to know whether the English nation were Christian or no. I answered we were and that they knew that before by our Kinges Maties. letter sent to the Emperour his father \(and hym selfe\), wherein it appeared he was defender of the Christian faith. 'But, ' said they, 'are not the Jesuists and fryres Christians two?' Unto which I answered they were, but not such as we were, for all Jesuists and fryres were banished out of England before I was borne, the English nations not houlding with the pope nor his doctryne, whose followers these padres \(as they cald them\) weare. Yt is Strang to see how often they sent to me about this matter, and in the end gave us wayning that we did not comenecate, confesse, nor baptiz with them, for then they should hold us to be all of one sect. Unto which I replied that their Honours needed not to stand in doubt of any such matter, for that was not the custom of our nation."

Having at last obtained, as be supposed, documents giving the desired privileges, Cocks set out on his return to Hirado, when a letter from Kyoto led him to suspect that all might not be as he wished:

"Whereupon I sought one to read over our privelegese, which with much a do at last I found a *bos* \(or pagon prist\) which did it, and was that we were restrayned to have our shiping to goe to no other place in Japan but Firando, and there to make sales."

This meant a great restriction of English trade. Cocks turned back to Yedo and asked that the fuller rights granted by Ieyasu might be renewed. He "could get nothing but words." In fact, by that time the Shogun's Council had issued the following decree:

"Be it strictly instructed that according to the command of the Premier issued some years ago to the effect that the conversion of the Japanese to Christianity is strictly prohibited, the lords of all the provinces shall take special care to keep all people, down to farmers, from joining that religion. Also, as the black ships, namely the English ships, belong to that religion, the provincial lords should send any of those ships to Nagasaki or Hirado, in case they happen to put in to the ports of their dominions, and no trade shall be carried on therein."

Pagés speaks of an edict issued by the Shogun that forbade the Japanese, under the penalty of being burned alive, from having any relations with the teachers of Christianity or their servants. The same penalty was to be visited on the wives and children of offenders and on their five nearest neighbours upon each side, unless these gave information. Daimyos were forbidden to keep Christians in their service.

Cocks thought that his troubles were partly owing to a Spaniard who was then in Yedo. Two great ships full of soldiers and treasure on the way from New Spain to the Philippines had been driven by contrary winds to Satsuma, and this man had been sent to pay his respects to the Shogun. An audience was not given him and in his vexation at being refused what was granted to the English he commenced to bring accusations against them and the Hollanders, saying that they had robbed all the Chinese junks sailing towards Japan, which was the reason why few had come that year. It may well be believed that Cocks would not hesitate to requite the ill turn done by the Spaniard. He himself wrote, saying:

"Yf they lookt out well about these 2 Spanish shipps arrived in Xaxtna full of men and treasure, they would find that they were sent of purpose by the King of Spaine, haveing knowledge of the death of the ould Emperour, thinking som papisticall *tono* \[lord\] might rise and rebell and so draw all the papistes to flock to them and take part, by which meanes they might on a sudden seaz upon som strong place and keepe it till more succors came, they not wanting money nor men for thackom-plishing such a strattigim. Which speeches of myne wrought so far that the Emperour sent to stay them, and, had not the great ship cut her cable in the howse so to escape, she had byn arrested, yet with her hast she left som of her men behind; and the other shipp being of some three hundred tons was cast away in a storme and driven on shore, but all \(he people saved. So in this sort I crid quittance with the Spaniardes for geveing out falce reportes of us, yet since verely thought to be true which I reported of them."

Cocks soon went so far as to suggest to the "Amerall of the sea" that he "put it into the Emperour's mynd to make a conquest of the Manillias and drive those small cre of Spaniards from thence, it being so neare unto Japon."

With such accusations and counter-accusations made by the merchants, it is not strange that Hidetada became more suspicious of foreigners. It did not help matters when commissioners sent in search of one of Hideyori's captains who was thought to be concealed in Nagasaki reported that many missionaries were living there and in other places. In 1617, when the daimyos went on New Year's Day to pay their respects to the Shogun, he took the occasion to administer a severe rebuke to the Daimyo of Omura. This young man, who had been baptised in infancy, still regarded Christianity with considerable favour, and his sister was an earnest believer. He was one of those that had been ordered, in 1614, to take charge of the deportation of the missionaries. Notwithstanding his report that he had done what was commanded, there was good reason to think he knew that some of the missionaries remained in his territories or had afterwards returned thither. He was now told that he must atone for his negligence by seeing that all were driven out. Pagés says that he received secret orders to put them to death. Only the first command was known by the Christian officials in Nagasaki, who decided it would be better to send away a few persons in order to make it safer for the others. Accordingly, some of the missionaries were sent in March to Macao, a part of whom very soon found means for returning.

Omura, though he had little liking for persecution, was afraid to disobey the Shogun. He thought that by putting one missionary to death he could frighten the others so that they would flee of their own accord. To his chagrin, the officials, instead of being satisfied with making one arrest, took into custody two of the missionaries, Fathers De l'Assumpcion and Machado, belonging respectively to the Franciscan and Jesuit orders. Omura still hoped he would be permitted to spare their lives. He sent a report of their arrest to Yedo and asked for further orders. The reply soon came that both men must be beheaded.

The letters written by these missionaries while in custody show the spirit in which they met their fate. Machado wrote:

"It is now twelve days that I have been a prisoner. I return a thousand thanks to Our Lord that He has deigned to grant me such great peace that there is nothing in the world I would prefer to my present condition of being a captive for the love of God, I return infinite thanks to His Divine Majesty that from the hour when I was made a prisoner I have not ceased to behold myself stretched upon the cross or bending beneath the edge of the sword. Blessed be the Lord who thus comforts those who for the love of him suffer even the lightest pains. I have never understood the deep meaning of the words of Scripture and the spiritual power they communicate as I have since I found myself in this condition."

The sentence was carried into effect May 21, 1617. Though guards were put about the place where the bodies were buried, the Christians went there in crowds to do honour to the martyrs.

Omura's hope that this execution would terrify the other missionaries was not realised. When Fathers Navarette and Saint-Joseph, Vicars Provincial respectively of the Dominicans and Augustinians, heard of the martyrdoms, they judged that the time had come when they ought to conceal themselves no longer, but go openly to Omura for the sake of strengthening the faith of the Christians and calling apostates to repentance. Their purpose soon became known to the people of Nagasaki. More than three thousand persons followed them out of the city to bid them farewell and to seek their blessing. Spending the first night in the suburbs of Nagasaki, the two missionaries then went slowly on their way, stopping at several places to preach, say mass, and administer the sacraments. In one place they erected an altar in the open air. Crowds gathered about them, listening eagerly to their words and coming afterwards to kneel at their feet for a blessing. Many that had apostatised professed repentance and sought forgiveness.

The two missionaries sent a letter to the Daimyo of Omura, saying that compassion for him and his people led them to come out from their concealment in order that they might urge him to repent of his great sin, and might do all in their power for the conversion of his subjects. This appeal was ineffective. The brave men were at once thrown into prison, whence in a few days they were taken to a small island and beheaded. A catechist who had accompanied Machado suffered with them. To put an end to the honours shown by the Christians to those that died for their faith, Omura had the bodies of the former martyrs disinterred so that, with those of the new victims, they might be weighted with stones and sunk in the sea. The Christian fraternities for a long time tried in vain to find the bodies, but some months afterwards two of them were washed ashore. These were taken to Nagasaki, whence at a later date some of the bones were sent to Manila and Macao as sacred relics.

These events made a great impression upon the believers. Many of those who had shown weakness became ashamed of their cowardice. In Nagasaki the Christians began to engage openly in religious services. The officials hesitated about taking action that would involve so many persons, and they also feared that in the existing state of excitement any attempts at suppression would lead to a riot. Father Moralez, who had become the Superior of the Dominicans, sent two monks to work secretly in Omura; also one of the Franciscans, clad in the dress of his order, went to the city in which the Daimyo lived and there preached openly. After having the joy of converting one of the executioners of De l'Assumpcion, he was thrown into prison, as was also one of the missionaries sent by Moralez.

By the order of the Shogun, Hasegawa Sahioe sent a violent letter to the officials at Nagasaki, giving directions that those persons who had furnished an asylum to Fathers Navarette and Saint-Joseph should be punished. These persons were arrested and soon after were put to death secretly so that there might be no danger of disturbance.

Another martyr that suffered at this time was a high officer of Omura, who had governed the territory during the absence of the Daimyo. It was he who had arrested De l'Assumpcion and presided at the execution of the first martyrs. The contemplation of their bravery led him to accept their religion. He became zealous in seeking to convert others, and especially to lead back those that had apostatised. The Buddhist priests soon procured his arrest and execution. The Daimyo, who wished to terrify the Christians, took pains to have it made known that he had not hesitated to condemn even his favourite officer for becoming an adherent of the proscribed religion.

From time to time missionaries were arrested in different provinces; but with a single exception none were executed between May, 1617, and August, 1622. This one exception was Father Sainte-Marthe, an aged Franciscan. For three years he was a prisoner in Kyoto. Itakura, the Shogun's representative, was little inclined to put him to death, and offered to send him to Mexico. The old man said he did not wish to be set free unless at the same time he was allowed to remain in Japan. He was finally beheaded in August, 1618.

There were many executions of Japanese Christians. The records from this time were crowded with accounts of their sufferings. Nagasaki furnished many of the victims. In that city Hasegawa Gonroku, a nephew of Sahioe, had become Governor. He had a number of persons arrested for sheltering the missionaries and native priests. Their wives and children were taken from them, November 25, 1618, fourteen persons were burned at the stake, among them being children aged ten, seven, and four years, as well as a babe only two months old. The next year another step was taken, and the Portuguese merchants saw among those being burned at the stake one of their own number, Domingo Jorge, who had sheltered two Jesuits. This merchant may have been under suspicion for other reasons. Japanese accounts say that in 1617, a foreign ship was captured by the Dutch. "It belonged to Jorchin \[Domingo Jorge\]\* and brought letters from the Portuguese. When these had been translated by the interpreters in Hirado, it was found that the Southern Barbarians \[Spaniards and Portuguese\] instigated the Japanese Christians to make a revolt." The sense of one letter was: "As soon as the news arrives that the number of Japanese Christians is sufficient, men-of-war will be sent." Kaempfer mentions two other letters alleged to have been found, one by the Dutch and the other by a Japanese ship, in which the Christians of Japan wrote to the King of Spain the details of a plot for overthrowing the Shogun's government. Most European writers have been inclined to consider these letters, especially the last two, either as never having existed or as having been forged by the Dutch.

Gonroku employed many spies who, under the pretence of becoming converts to Christianity, tried to discover the hiding-places of the missionaries. Bars of silver had hitherto been exposed to view in the public square with a notice that they were for the reward of any one who gave information leading to the arrest of a thief. To the placard making this promise were now added the words, "or of a Christian teacher." The difficulties of concealment became so great that most of the missionaries left the city to hide in the mountains or to flee to other parts of the country.

A letter written March, 1620, by Richard Cocks refers to the destruction of Christian edifices. He had often wished that the English factory might be removed to Nagasaki, but this, he says,

"Heretofore was not thought fitt, because then a papist Portingale bishopp lived in the towne and ther was 10 or 12 parish churches, besids monestaries, all which are now pulled downe to the grownd this yeare, an end being made thereof; and the places where all such churches and monestaries weare, with the churchyords, are all turned into streetes, and all the dead mens boanes taken out of the ground and cast forth for their frendes and parentes to bury them where they please. I doe not re-joyce herin, but wish all Japon were Christians; yet in the tyme of that bishopp heare were soe many prists and Jesuists with their partakers that one could not parse the streetes without being by them called Lutranos and herejos \[Lutherans and heretics\], which now we are very quiet and non of them dare open his mouth to speake such a word."

Nagasaki was not the only place where the Christians were persecuted. In 1619 orders from Yedo, and afterwards a visit of the Shogun himself, led to more active measures in Kyoto. After leaving the city, the Shogun learned that a large number of believers was confined in the prison. Angry at not having been informed of this, he ordered that all be put to death. without distinction of age or sex. October 7, 1619, the people gathered in crowds to watch the victims as they were carried to the place of execution. Preceded by officers to clear the way and by criers to announce their crime, fifty-two martyrs were drawn in carts through the streets. The first and last carts contained only men; but nine others were laden with women and children, the latter carried in their mothers' arms or clinging to their knees. One child, eight years old, was blind. A woman named Thecla was the mother of five children from three to thirteen years of age. They as well as her husband were to suffer with her that day. From time to time a herald called out: "The Shogun desires and commands that all these persons he put to death because they are Christians;" and then, as though it were the response in an antiphonal service, the martyrs shouted: "It is true; we die for Jesus. Blessed be Jesus\!" Crossing one of the bridges over the Kamo River, the procession came to a large open space opposite the temple in which was the great image of Buddha erected by Hideyori in honour of his father. Here had been planted a number of stakes with fagots piled about them in such a way as to leave a little space for the victims, two of whom, placed back to back, were bound to each of the stakes. When Thecla descended from the cart, she was seen to be clothed in a rich garment, as though for a festival.

A great crowd of people had gathered to see the strange sight. The fagots were lighted and through the smoke could be caught glimpses of the mothers trying to quiet the little children held in their arms. One of Thecla's daughters, who was bound near her, was heard calling out: "Mother, I cannot see any more? and then came the woman's reply: "Invoke the help of Jesus and of Mary." These names uttered by many lips mingled with the cries of frightened children and the groans of the dying, until gradually all such sounds ceased and nothing more was heard but the roaring and crackling of the flames.\*

Through the first years of the persecution, the number of missionaries in Japan, instead of being lessened, was gradually increasing. Those sent away soon returned, while others, ready for martyrdom and even desiring it came from Macao and the Philippines. In 1619, the Jesuits are said to have baptised one thousand eight hundred converts. The next year four Fathers baptised over a thousand persons in northeastern Hondo. One of them went into the island of Yezo \(which had been visited by another missionary two years earlier\) and found there many believers from the mainland who were eager for his ministrations. At some mines in the interior were two persons who had formerly served as catechists and were now glad to assist him in teaching their fellow-labourers.

The return of Hashikura, Date Masamune's ambas-sador to Europe, had been long delayed. In 1617, he and Father Sotelo came to Acapulco, where they found a ship belonging to Date. The Sendai Daimyo had sent a second messenger in 1616, to learn what had become of the first, and this may account for the presence of the ship in Mexico. A new governor who was on his way to the Philippines made arrangements to have the ship take him thither, those in charge being willing to do this because they could obtain there a more profitable cargo than was to be found in Mexico. Manila was reached in June of the next year. Here, as already recorded, Sotelo and his papers were seized. He was afterwards sent back to Mexico. For some unknown reason the Japanese also were delayed so that it was August, 1620, when, after his seven years of absence, Hashikura, with a suite now numbering only eleven persons reached Sendai. According to Pagés he reported to Masamune that the Christian religion was only an empty show. This is in accord with other accounts that represent him as apostatising. A letter written in 1677 by his grandson says that Hashikura, though never a Christian at heart, became one nominally "because otherwise he could not see the Spanish King and get the answer to Masamune's letter."

The return of this ambassador may have increased the suspicion that Masamune was planning an alliance with Spain for the purpose of supplanting the Shogun. His desire to clear himself from such charges is thought to be the reason why at about this time he issued three proclamations. In the first, all those who, in opposition to the Shogun's will, had become Christians were exhorted to return to their former religions. In case of refusal, the goods of the rich were to be confiscated, while the poor were to be put to death. The second proclamation promised honour and rewards to informers. The third ordered the banishment of all Christian teachers who would not renounce their faith. For several years these edicts were not enforced, Masamune turning his blind eye towards the fact that missionaries were residing in Sendai. Indeed, one of his leading vassals was "father of the Christians and the strongest pillar of the church."

Father Zuñiga, an Augustinian monk, had so won the appreciation of his converts that after he had been driven out of Japan they wrote to the Provincial in Manila, asking that he be sent to them once more and promising that in exchange for the living missionary they would send the body of the martyr Saint-Joseph:\*

The ship in which Zuñiga sailed, in company with a Dominican named Flores, was captured off the coast of Formosa by an English vessel that belonged to a combined fleet of English and Dutch. The commander of this latter vessel had once been a prisoner of the Inquisition in Seville, and was doubtless very willing to pay off the debt of vengeance he owed to Spain and Roman Catholicism. The ecclesiastical character of the monks was recognised through the disguises they had assumed, while among their papers were found a letter appointing Zuñiga to be Vicar Provincial, the commission of Flores, and other suspicious documents. The missionaries were therefore sent to Hirado, where they remained in custody of the Dutch. For sixteen months Zuñiga and Flores refused to acknowledge that they were priests. A letter written by Zuñiga says that to the direct questions of a Japanese official, who was sent to examine them. "We replied that we were not Fathers," and shows that they justified themselves for making this statement by the mental interpretation that they were not fathers in the sense of being parents of children.\* He adds: Our reasons for so doing were the necessity common throughout Japan, and the desire not to cause the death of those who had brought us nor to expose a great number of persons to the danger of denying the faith."

Various tortures were inflicted by the Dutch in the vain attempt to extort confessions. The Diary of Richard Cocks, as well as the letters of the missionaries, gives accounts of several examinations that were held before Hasegawa Gonroku. What is remarkable is that Gonroku had formerly known Zuñiga; yet, although many Japanese and Chinese, besides Portuguese and a native of Manila, insisted on the identity, Gonroku declared the proof insufficient. His unwillingness to pronounce judgment gave rise to the doubts mentioned by Cocks, who wrote: "As some say, Gonroku Dono is suspected to be a Christian."

Finally three missionaries of as many different orders were brought from their confinement in the Omura prison to see if they recognised the accused persons. With them came Thomas Araki, the apostate priest, who for some reason, perhaps that he might act as a spy, perhaps because the sincerity of his recantation was doubted, had also been imprisoned at Omura. On arriving at Hirado, he took part in some Buddhist ceremonies, and afterwards bore witness that while in Omura he had heard some of his fellow-prisoners assert that one of the captives was a priest named Zuñiga. The missionaries all declared that they had never seen Flores, though all but one of them testified that in former years they had seen the other person at Nagasaki, dressed as a merchant. One of the Japanese officials, an apostate from Christianity, who was doubtless well aware that they knew more than they had told, asked:

"Is it permissible for a monk or a priest to deny being such?"

Father Spinola, one of the Omura prisoners, answered:

"You do not understand the difference between a Christian and a priest. The former ought always to declare himself a Christian; but no one is under obligation to acknowledge that he is a priest."

Thereupon an Englishman that was present said that in his country the Roman Catholic priests constantly denied that they were such and so saved themselves from being executed, Spinola declared this to be a calumny, saying that he himself while in England had acknowledged that he was a Jesuit priest, and that many of his associates had done the same, though it had cost some of them their lives.

At last, the Fathers from Omura, seeing that the proofs were too strong to be resisted, had a private interview with Zuñiga in which they advised him not to deny his identity any longer, for it was improbable that he would be released, and a continuance of the dissimulation was likely to cause scandal. Zuñiga therefore acknowledged before the judge that he was a priest. Flores did not confess until some months later and after an unsuccessful attempt had been made by Father Collado to rescue him from prison. When the Shogun heard of this attempt, he was filled with greater wrath than before against the Christians. His suspicions had been increased by a report that Zuñiga was a natural son of the Spanish King \(he was really the son of a former Viceroy of Mexico\) and had now come to lead the Christians in delivering over Japan to his father. Gonroku was censured for having been remiss in duty and was ordered to put to death not only Zuñiga, Flores, and the Japanese captain of the boat on which they had been apprehended, but also all the missionaries that were in prison, and the families of those persons who had given them shelter.

The first execution took place in Nagasaki, August 19, 1622. Twelve Japanese, who had been sailors or passengers on the captured ship, were decapitated and their heads were placed before the stakes where Zuñiga, Flores, and the Japanese captain were burned. Three weeks later \(September 10, 1622\), came what has since been known as the "Great Martyrdom," when thirty persons were beheaded and twenty-five burned. Among the latter were nine foreign priests. The most famous *of* the number was Father Spinola, a Jesuit of noble birth, and a man of unusual talents. He had been in Japan since 1602. His scholarship had done much to commend him to the Japanese, and at Kyoto he had founded an academy for scientific studies and original investigation. He had been in captivity for nearly four years.

The Omura prisoners were brought the preceding day by boat to a small village, where they were transferred to horses; Spinola, mounted on a sorry-looking white nag, being placed at the head of the procession. To the neck of each captive was attached a rope, whose other end was held by a guard walking beside the horse. Four hundred soldiers acted as an escort. The night was spent at Urakami, the town whence, two hundred and fifty years later, a new persecution sent into exile three thousand descendants of the Christians who now looked with mingled sorrow and exultation on those that were about to attain the glory of martyrdom.

The next morning the procession went on its way, the confessors singing psalms or occasionally speaking a few words to the Christians, who came as near as possible in order to receive their blessing. It was but a short distance to the hill on the outskirts of Nagasaki where the martyrs of 1597 had given up their lives. Here a large space had been enclosed. Inside the paling had been set twenty-five stakes for those that were to be burned. Instead of having the wood placed as near as was usually done, it was put in two long rows seven or eight feet distant from the line of stakes, the object being to prolong the sufferings of the victims. Within the enclosure was also erected a stand for the use of the Governor's deputy and other high officials of Nagasaki and Omura. Thousands of spectators crowded about the fences or stood on the neighboring hills. It had been Gonroku's desire to have the Christians present so that the sufferings of their teachers and fellow-believers might be a warning to them.

The martyrs from Omura had to wait an hour for the arrival of those that came from Nagasaki, While still mounted upon their horses, they confessed one another, sang hymns, and addressed the people that were within hearing. Special mention is made of the discourse of Spinola to the Spaniards and Portuguese. When at last the thirty-three prisoners from Nagasaki arrived, those condemned to be burned were brought to the stakes. Among them was one woman, aged eighty, who had given shelter to a missionary. Those decapitated included several women and children. As before, the severed heads were placed in front of those that were bound to the stakes. Father Spinola chanted the *"Laudate Dominum, omnes gentes, "* the other Fathers and Brothers responding, while the children, who were in the crowd outside the enclosure, also joined in the singing. Spinola then addressed a few words to the Governor's deputy. After the fires were lighted, he and the other martyrs continued to speak to the people so long as it was possible for them to do so. Some remained alive for two or three hours. When the flames burned too briskly, the executioners partially quenched them by throwing on water so that death might not too quickly put an end to the agony of the martyrs.

Three Japanese Brothers, belonging to the order of the Jesuits, "disturbed the joy of that day." Almost as soon as they felt the heat of the flames, they began by their contortions and struggles to show how weak they were. Their associates tried in vain to inspire them with courage. At last they broke their bonds, and rushing out from the midst of the flames, begged for mercy. Two of them called upon the name of Buddha, while the third, as though ashamed of his cowardice, returned at once to his stake. Some say that he left it only to remonstrate with the others. None, however, were spared; the executioners thrust the cravens back into the fire and held them there by long poles.

For three days the remains of the martyrs were carefully guarded so that they might not be taken as relics by the Christians, who came in crowds to the outside of the enclosure that they might venerate those who had died for the faith. Finally, the charred remains, the heads and bodies of those that had been decapitated, and the various religious objects that had been found in the houses of those arrested, were thrown with wood and charcoal into pits, where they were burned for two days. The ashes and even the ground that had been soaked with blood were then put into straw sacks and carried out to sea. The sailors, before returning to shore, were made to bathe themselves and to give their boats a thorough washing, so that none of the polluted dust should be brought back to land.

Other executions soon followed at Nagasaki, Omura, Hirado, and other places. The number of those burned or beheaded in 1622 was over one hundred and twenty, including sixteen Fathers and twenty Brothers of the different orders.

Alas\! how often does the weakness of men stand out in contrast with their displays of strength. It seems strange to read that at the time when community of suffering ought to have united the hearts of all the missionaries, there was a new display of the dissensions between the societies. September 7, an apostolic inquest, relative to the martyrs of 1597, was opened in Nagasaki. Of the three judges originally appointed, one had gone to Manila, another was among those to be martyred three days later, and the third was Father Collado, the Vicar Provincial of the Dominicans. The places of the first two were supplied by others, and the proceedings, after the interruption caused by the Great Martyrdom, were resumed September 14. Pagés says that many of the witnesses that had been summoned declined to appear, those who would have given their life in confession of their faith not fearing the excommunication that might be incurred by their disobedience. Apparently these were the Jesuits, who refused to acknowledge any authority save that of the Prelate of their Society appointed by the Metropolitan of the Indies, and who disregarded the legitimate Bishop, Mgr. Valens, himself a Jesuit, who was then in Macao. Probably their disinclination to witness was in part because, so far as Europeans were concerned, the glory of the martyrdom belonged to members of other orders. Some of the meetings of the inquest were held on board a vessel that was lying in the harbour. Collado, who took the documents to Rome, also carried many accusations against the Jesuit missionaries. He was ably seconded by a letter alleged to have been written by Father Sotelo, who had finally succeeded in reaching Japan, where he arrived just after the martyrdom of Zuñiga and Flores. He had been immediately arrested. Having been granted his request to be brought before the Governor of Nagasaki, he said: "I am Father Louis Sotelo, the same who went to Spain as an ambassador of Date Masamune. I have now returned with the replies to his letters. As no shipmaster would give a priest passage, I assumed a secular dress. Will you kindly announce to the Shogun's Council that I have returned. If it condemns me to death, I am prepared to submit for the sake of the religion of Jesus Christ, which I have always desired to preach in this country." The Governor promised to send the desired message, but kept Sotelo confined in the prison at Omura. It is from there that a letter, which has given rise to much controversy, is said to have been written by him in 1624, Charlevoix regards it as a forgery. Pagés thinks it is genuine, but suggests that it may have been somewhat changed when printed by enemies of the Jesuits.\* It charges the latter with intriguing against Sotelo, with causing scandal by their evil acts and pernicious doctrines, with annoying the members of other orders, and with being the cause of various evils that hindered the progress of Christianity. Father Cevicos published a reply to this letter and the controversy gave rise to much ill-feeling.

In 1623, Hidetada, following the example set by Ieyasu, had the title of Shogun transferred to his son Iemitsu. The investiture of the new Shogun was made the occasion for re-publishing the laws against Christianity. In that same year between four and five hundred persons were put to death in the immediate possessions of the Tokugawa family. On December 4, a company of fifty persons, including two foreign priests, was led out to a hill near Yedo, where preparation had been made for their execution by burning. One of the number had apostatised while in prison, and though he was led out with the others and bound to the stake, he was set free before the fagots were lighted. It is said that his place was supplied in a way that made a great impression upon all the spectators. After the preparations had been completed, a gentleman of high rank, accompanied by a retinue of servants, came riding up towards the judges. The guards made way for him, supposing that he was the bearer of an official message. Descending from his horse, he went before the chief judge and asked why these men were being put to death in such a cruel way.

"Because they are Christians;" was the answer.

"I, too, am a Christian," said the man, "and I demand the privilege of sharing their fate."

The officials were in doubt as to what they ought to do. Finally the Shogun, to whom word was sent, ordered that the man should be added to the number of martyrs. When he was bound to the stake, five of his servants tried to follow him, while from among the spectators, three hundred other persons came to kneel before the judges asking that they, too, be allowed to give up their lives for the sake of Christ. The judges drove them away, and fearing a tumult, hastened to complete the execution. The remains of the victims were left under guard on the place of martyrdom. The third day the Christians gathered in a crowd and took away whatever they could find. This angered Hidetada, who ordered that all the Christians who could be found should be put to death. Twenty-seven persons were executed December 29. Thirteen of the number were not Christians, but had received believers into their houses, or as neighbours were held responsible. Eighteen of the victims were children. These had their brains beaten out, were cut in twain, or were otherwise killed in the sight of their parents, before the latter were put to death.

Orders were issued in 1623 and 1624 against the Spaniards in general. All of them were to be sent out of the country. They were forbidden to take with them any Japanese, even their own wives. Moreover, no Japanese Christian was to go abroad for trade, while even unbelievers were not to go to the Philippines, it being feared that they would bring back Christian teachers in their ships. This put an end to all commerce with Manila. In 1622 Hidetada had refused to receive an embassy from the Philippines. A second one that came in 1623, although it was able to report that the Spanish Governor had issued orders forbidding missionaries to go to Japan, and that the Archbishop of Manila had been induced to use his authority to the same end, was sent back with the reply that the Shogun could not consider the embassy as anything more than a device of the missionaries, and that he could never receive the envoys of a country that followed a religion so false and pernicious that he had been compelled to issue a prohibition against it and to exile its teachers. It was added that at first the Spaniards had been welcomed because they came in the name of commerce; but instead of bringing any advantage to the country, they had polluted it with their diabolical religion. While in the harbour of Nagasaki the embassy was closely guarded and subjected to many humiliations. The reason why the prohibitions against the Philippines were more strict than those against Macao, may have been because nine Dominicans, Franciscans, and Augustinians came from the former place in 1623, notwithstanding the Governor's and Archbishop's interdiction of such enterprises. The truth was, whether the Japanese knew it or not, that these dignitaries had yielded to the entreaties of the heads of the three orders in the Philippines "under the condition that the departure should take place in the greatest secrecy." In Macao, the officials were more earnest to keep their commerce from being ruined by the zeal of the missionaries, and this was so well recognised that many Fathers went from there to the Philippines, where they thought the chances for reaching Japan were better.

Further orders of the Shogun declared that any foreign ship coming to Japan must register the names of its crew and passengers. The officers of the ship were to be held responsible for all persons on board. Not only missionaries, but also those that brought them to Japan, were to be burned; the ship and its merchandise to be confiscated.

Date Masamune now began to take a prominent place among the persecuting daimyos. His subordinates were told to make out a list of the Christians. Many of these were imprisoned and some were put to death. Among those arrested was Father Diego de Carvalho, a Jesuit. In February, 1624, he and his companions were led to the bank of a river, stripped of their clothing, and bound to stakes that were placed in a pool of icy-cold water. They were kept there for three hours and then left to sit or lie upon the frozen ground. Two of the Christians soon died, and their bodies, after being cut into small pieces, were thrown into the river. The others were taken back to prison, only to be led forth four days later to the same pool. They were made alternately to stand in the water, which reached to their knees, and to kneel down in it. A cold wind was blowing and ere long a snowstorm set in. As evening approached, the surface of the pool began to freeze over. One by one the sufferers became insensible. Father Carvalho was the last to die. Their bodies were treated as those of their companions had been, though the Christians managed to get possession of the heads of five of the martyrs, including that of Father Carvalho.

In that section of the country known as Dewa, in the northwestern part of Hondo, one hundred and nine Christians were put to death. Other parts of the country added to the number of the martyrs. Three foreign priests who had been confined in Omura were burned at the stake in August, 1624. One of them was Sotelo, Date's former ambassador.

In 1625 there were still in Japan twenty Jesuit Fathers and four Brothers, besides some members of other orders. Nagasaki was regarded as the safest place in the country. Two of the four Sub-prefects were Christians, as were many of the citizens. There were, however, many defections, and those that remained faithful were subjected to much annoyance. Hasegawa Gonroku ordered that none of the Christians should be allowed to travel by land or sea more than a league from the city. It is evident that this must have caused much hardship to those engaged in trade. When foreign ships came, the citizens were to have no direct communication with them. The persons and goods of all strangers entering the city were to be searched so as to make sure that no Christian books, rosaries, or medals were brought. Portuguese merchants were permitted to lodge only in the houses of non-Christians.

The next year \(1626\) Hasegawa was replaced by Mizuno Kawachi no Kami. While the former had taken little pleasure in the persecutions that his office compelled him to superintend, his successor was a bitter opponent of Christianity. Almost immediately after his arrival, three foreign priests and six Japanese Christians were burned. Thirteen stakes had been erected, but at the last moment four Portuguese who had been arrested purchased their lives by the denial of their faith. A few days afterwards nine Japanese, who had given the missionaries shelter, were executed.

Near the close of 1626, when Portuguese and Chinese ships came as usual to Nagasaki, the Christians were not allowed to lodge the merchants, to trade with them, to become their servants, or even to converse with them. The Portuguese merchants themselves were treated with much insolence. Their chests were searched, their papers read, and their religious medals thrown into the sea. Two vessels that came from the Philippines were immediately turned back.

Mizuno, who held his office for three years, did his best in that time to exterminate the religion he so hated. Christian artisans were not permitted to ply their trades. Many new forms of torture were introduced. In this, however, Mizuno's powers of invention were not equal to those of Matsukura, the new Lord of Arima. In the latter's territories Christians were made to kneel on hot coals, were suspended by different parts of the body to trees, were branded on cheeks and forehead with the three ideographs that were pronounced *Kirishitan* \(Christian\), or were plunged into the sea until nearly drowned, when they were drawn out only to have the operation repeated at short intervals. But what was regarded as the most terrible of all torments was to plunge the victim again and again into the sulphur springs of Onsen, whose corrosive waters gave rise to horrible sores. The frightful sounds, the heat, the sulphurous vapours, and the dismal surroundings of these springs have led to their being named "Jigoku," the Buddhist word for Hell. One spring has a temperature of over 200° Fahr.

The missionaries that were in hiding suffered many privations. A letter written in 1626 by Father Couros says:

"The Christians that had me under their care lost courage and earnestly urged me to take ship at once and hasten to secure my safety. In order to calm them I promised to depart the following night. Meanwhile my host, unknown to the others had arranged a pit or subterranean cavity twelve palms long by four broad. Neither the rays of the sun nor any other light entered it. That night I, together with my catechist and a servant, crept into it without the knowledge of any person except our host. The nights and days passed by in darkness, the only light I obtained was a little for eating, for reciting the divine office, and for writing certain letters connected with my ministry. Food was passed to us through a concealed opening that was reached by pulling away the straw in an adjoining hut where an old man was at work, and this was opened only for so long a time as was necessary for introducing the food. Every three days the door of the pit was opened for the removal of ordure. The food was very scanty and very poor, for our host feared to make purchases lest he should excite suspicion. I remained thirty-five days in this dungeon, going out only on Holy Saturday, Easter, and the days of the octave, in order to celebrate mass. Afterwards I moved to another pit of the same size that my host's charity had prepared for me, I am still there at this time, namely, the last of September. I have with me the necessary outfit for celebrating mass. Above the pit is a shed where my host keeps his tools. Here there is a small door covered with straw and heaps of matting in such a way as to avert suspicion. I go out at night, arrange my altar, and say mass. Before daybreak I return to the pit with the vestments and other sacred objects."\*

A Franciscan missionary arrested in 1627 was unable to destroy a paper that contained a list of the members of his order who remained in Japan. This was forwarded to the Shogun and became the occasion for his ordering a more stringent enforcement of the laws, Mizuno was replaced by Takenaka Uneme, whose reputation for cruelty was so great that many of the Christians, on hearing of the appointment, hastened to escape from Nagasaki before he should arrive. His acts did not belie his reputation. The chronicles of the next few years are largely occupied with details of the methods taken by him and others to exterminate Christianity. The stories of suffering are so terrible that modern readers will prefer to be spared the details of what was endured by those subjected to torture. Very many persons who had been numbered among the believers were unable to stand the test, and promised to give up Christianity. Ere we condemn their weakness, let us think how hard it is for us to endure some comparatively trifling pain, and ask whether we could bear up under the most excruciating tortures that human ingenuity could invent. Let us remember, too, that many of the sufferers had for years been shut off from their religious teachers, that some of them were new converts, and that behind none of them was that kind of strength and training that comes to those whose ancestors for generations have known the Christian religion. Yes, thousands did fall away; but there were others whose faithfulness unto death proved their sincerity and has won for them the admiration of all Christendom.

The missionaries by their words and example helped to sustain the constancy of the believers and even inspired in many a desire for martyrdom like that seen in the early church when Rome tried to crush out Christianity. Of what avail were threats uttered against those that longed to die for their Lord, believing that the more severe the tortures they endured the greater reason was there to rejoice in thought of the reward that awaited them?

The first arrests made by Takenaka were those of thirty-seven men and twenty-seven women, whom he sent to Onsen with directions that they were not to be put to death, but to be tortured until they apostatised, even though years might be required to bring this about. By day and night the corrosive water was poured at intervals upon their bodies. This plan was so successful that sixty of the sufferers yielded. To avoid the inconvenience of sending other persons to so distant a place as Onsen, artificial baths, which proved as efficient as the natural springs, were about this time made in the suburbs of Nagasaki. Takenaka was not satisfied with persecuting the living. Saying that he could not tolerate even dead Christians, he caused their bodies to be dug up from the cemeteries and burned.

After a few months there was a lull in the persecution as though all had been done that the Shogun had ordered. It was afterwards thought that Takenaka's purpose was to make the missionaries less cautious so that he might discover where they were. However this may have been, he was soon able to secure the arrest of three and also of a Japanese Jesuit Father, Ichida Pinto, These were confined in the Omura jail and active persecution was resumed.

The Christians in other parts of Japan were suffering in much the same ways as their brethren in Nagasaki, The missionaries that remained in the country were obliged to keep closely concealed. Not much information concerning their movements has been preserved, as it was difficult for them to send letters. The little knowledge we have of this period is chiefly concerning the sufferings to which the Christians were subjected. The list of martyrs constantly grew longer. How many lost their lives in these persecutions cannot be known. Many authors have written as though the martyrs were to be reckoned by tens of thousands or even by hundreds of thousands. One writer has given the number as over two millions. Father Cardim's Catalogue, printed in 1646, gives the names of the martyrs from 1557 to 1640; and Murdoch, after carefully checking the list, says that, apart from those perishing in the Shimabara Revolt and those put to death in connection with the Portuguese embassy of 1640, Cardim records only 1420 victims. Father Steichen in "The Christian Daimyo" reckons that, allowing for omissions and adding those suffering after 1640, the whole number of martyrs may have been about 2000. It may be questioned, however, whether there may not have been many more who lost their lives on account of their faith. Little account was made in those days of the common people, and such officials as were bitterly opposed to Christianity would not hesitate to brush aside its followers in the humble ranks of life. Moreover, outside of the persons officially executed, there would be many deaths indirectly caused by the privations of those that were driven from their homes, who were as truly martyrs as if they had perished at the stake or by the sword.

Takenaka, as we have seen, was ready to have a long time spent in securing apostasy. It would have been particularly pleasing to him if some of the foreign missionaries could have been induced to renounce their faith. Those arrested in 1629 were kept for two years in the jail at Omura.\* In December, 1631, they were taken to Onsen, together with a Spanish Brother and two women of mixed Portuguese and Japanese blood. All remained firm and were brought to the prison in Nagasaki. The women were sent to Macao and the men were burned at the stake in September, 1632.

Hidetada died in 1632. His son, lemitsu, carried out to its completion the policy his father had adopted concerning the Christians. Under his rule the land was finally rid of the foreign missionaries and most of their native helpers. Thirty-three Jesuits, six Dominicans, two Franciscans, and two secular priests were put to death. In the first year of his rule \(1632\) the number of missionaries had been increased by the arrival of eleven. One of these was Father Sebastian Vieyra, who had been appointed Vice-Provincial of the Jesuits and the deputy of the Bishop. The latter still remained in Macao, his failure ever to come to Japan being the cause of much adverse criticism. The account of Vieyra's voyage will serve as an example to show how much some of the missionaries were willing to endure in order to reach a land where they knew that almost certain death awaited them.

Vieyra, who had formerly spent several years in Japan, had been sent in 1623 to Macao, and from there to Rome, that he might plead the cause of the Jesuits against their accusers and create a deeper interest in their work. Desiring to return to Japan, he went to Manila, where, by paying an enormous price, he hired a Chinese captain to give him passage. Disguised in Chinese costume, he went on board the junk to find that, instead of being allowed to remain in what might by courtesy be called the cabin, he was forced to conceal himself in the hold, where there was not sufficient light for reading, and the air was made almost unbearable by the stench of deerskins that formed a large part of the cargo. He remained ten days shut up in this place. Then he learned that, contrary to the agreement made with the captain, there were a Dominican and two Franciscan missionaries on board. There were also eleven Japanese from Arima, who had interest in the cargo. When the sailors discovered that there were missionaries on the ship, they wished to return to the Philippines, or to leave on some island the passengers whose presence might be a source of danger to all. The Japanese merchants also desired this, though when Vieyra, recognising in the most hostile of them a man whom he had formerly known and whose confessor he had been, called him by name and reminded him of their former relations, the whole eleven, all of whom were apostate Christians, respectfully saluted the Father and showed a more favourable disposition. Notwithstanding this change, the missionaries would probably have been set ashore on Formosa had not a severe tempest driven them past that island. There are few things like a storm at sea for making men mindful of religious duties, and the frightened apostates, as well as many of the crew, confessed their sins to the priests and sought pardon, promising that if their lives were spared they would take the missionaries to Japan. Both Japanese and Chinese signed a written agreement not to give information against them. As the vessel neared the Goto Islands, the Fathers were concealed in various places so that they might not be discovered by the officials. Vieyra was hidden in a water-tank where he almost died for want of air. The others suffered in similar ways, but felt repaid by their success in getting into Japan undiscovered.

The next year Vieyra was captured, and after spending some time in the prison at Omura, was sent by the Shogun's orders to Yedo. There he was closely questioned by the officials. One of his letters says that they, and a large number of the people who gathered to see him, expressed their conviction that the doctrines as he explained them were true, but the Shogun's dislike of Christianity prevented them from becoming its adherents. Vieyra was asked to write out a synopsis of his belief. He spent nearly fourteen hours in preparing this statement, which was sent to the Shogun. June 6, 1634, he and Father Gomez, with several Japanese, were sent to the *fosse,* as French writers have denominated a form of torture that had recently been invented. By the side of a pit about six feet deep was erected a post with a projecting arm from which the victim was suspended head downwards after he had been bound with cords in such a way as to retard the circulation of the blood. He was lowered into the pit, whose air was sometimes made stiflingly offensive by the presence of offal. In some cases the sufferer was tied up in a sack, one hand being left outside so that it might be used in making a sign of recantation' Alter a person had hung for a short time, blood would begin to ooze from his mouth, nose, and ears It was customary to bleed the temples, so as to prevent too great congestion. It is said that death would not come for two or three days, and in some cases might be delayed for six days. Father Vieyra was alive at the end of three days, though his companions were all dead. The impatience of the executioners to be done with the affair then led them to commit him to the flames.

Less happy was Father Ferreyra, a Jesuit, who the previous year \(1633\) was sent to the *fosse* in Nagasaki with three other Europeans and four Japanese, Among them was Father Julian Nakaura, one of the four Japanese who went to Rome in the embassy of 1582. All the sufferers remained faithful to the end except Ferreyra who, after five hours, yielded to the terrible torture and made the sign that showed his readiness to renounce Christianity. Great was the joy of Takenaka. At last he had gamed the desired victory over one of the foreign teachers of the hated religion. To the Jesuits this was a sad blow, and it doubtless had much influence, as Takenaka had hoped, in making it easier to secure the apostasy of Japanese Christians. The Roman Catholic historians state that twenty years later Ferreyra repented of his weakness, openly professed his belief in Christianity, and at the age of seventy-four endured, without faltering the torments of the *fosse* from which he had once shrunk, the proofs of this statement, however, are not so strong as could be desired.

In June, 1635, new orders were sent to all the daimyos that they should completely extirpate Christianity from their domains. Directions a year later to the Governors of Nagasaki included among other specifications the following;

"The sending of Japanese ships to foreign countries is strictly forbidden,"

"Japanese must not be sent to other countries. If any try to go secretly, they shall be punished by death, while the ship and crew must be kept in custody, and the matter reported."

"If any Japanese who has resided abroad returns to Japan, he shall be punished by death."

"Rewards to those informing against Christians shall be as follows:—For religious teachers, three hundred or two hundred pieces of silver according to their rank. In other cases, as previously provided."

"Foreigners who propagate the religion of the Fathers, and likewise persons of evil reputation, shall as before be sent to prison in Omura."

"Descendants of the Portuguese\* must not be allowed to remain in the country. Any who retain them contrary to the law shall be put to death, and their relatives shall be punished according to the degree of the offence."

The next year the Japanese prepared a small artificial island that was connected with Nagasaki by a bridge. To the narrow limits of this island, which was called Deshima, the Portuguese merchants that came from Macao were confined during their stay in Japan. Kaempfer tells us that by his own measuring he "found the breadth of the island to be of eighty-two common paces, and the main length of two hundred and thirty-six."

The last two survivors of the Dominicans in Japan had been martyred in 1634. The members of the order in the Philippines were earnest in the desire to resume the work for which their brethren had given up their fives. In 1636 four Fathers, one of whom was a Japanese, were selected to make the attempt. The Governor of Manila, on receiving information that a ship had been prepared to take them to Loochoo, had the vessel burned. A second was procured and despatched without attracting the attention of the sentinels that had been put along the coast to guard against such attempts. The Fathers, accompanied by two secular priests, one a Japanese and the other of mixed Spanish and Chinese parentage, reached Loochoo in safety, and after remaining there about a year, were sent as prisoners to Nagasaki, where they were executed. The next year Father Mastrilli, a Jesuit who had managed to enter Japan, met with the same fate.

We now come to what has been known by the Japanese as the "Christian Rebellion." It has also been named the "Shimabara Revolt" from the place where its principal events occurred. Though it may be doubted whether religious considerations held the chief place in causing this outbreak, many of the leaders were Christians, and, as the movement went on, it became more closely associated with Christianity, so that its suppression gave what at the time seemed the deathblow to that religion in Japan.

The peninsula of Shimabara formed a part of the daimiate of Arima, which has held so important a place in our history. It will be remembered that under its Christian daimyos the Buddhist temples were destroyed, many churches were erected, and most of the inhabitants professed the new faith. For a long time Arima was a stronghold of Christianity, and in its schools were educated not only those that became evangelists but also those who painted the pictures, carved the images, and made the various utensils used in the churches.

The apostasy of a later daimyo was followed by that of many of his subjects. Others stood unmoved, and even among those that conformed to the new order of things there must have been many who sympathised with the Christians. When persecutions broke out in different parts of Japan, Nagasaki was for a long time the asylum where believers sought shelter; and when that city became dangerous, the proximity of Arima, together with the fact that a large proportion of its inhabitants was ready to give them succour, caused it to be chosen as a refuge.

Near the peninsula of Shimabara was the island of Amakusa, This, which had at one time been another stronghold of Christianity, was now under the rule of Terasawa, the son of the man by the same name whose defection from Christianity has been previously recorded. He also held Karatsu, in the northern part of Kyushu, and made it his chief residence. The elder Terasawa, who died in 1633, had, after his own defection from Christianity, dealt for the most part leniently with his believing subjects, but in 1629 he had sent to Amakusa as his lieutenant another apostate, with orders to suppress the Christian religion. Among the inhabitants of the island were some of the former retainers of Konishi, who, under the persecutions instituted after the fall of their lord, had left their old homes rather than give up their faith.

The insurrection is often described as an uprising of "farmers." It needs to be remembered, however, that the distinction between the agricultural and the military classes was not then so marked as it afterwards became, and also that some of these farmers were men who had once fought under Konishi and other generals in Korea, but who, having lost employment because of the misfortunes of their lords or on account of their own faith, had been forced to earn a living by the labour of their hands. Such persons would not entirely lose the martial spirit, and, though age had now enfeebled their powers, it is probable that they had taught their children how to use military arms. The number of those in Arima who had formerly been warriors was increased by the fact that when, in 1614, the apostate daimyo was removed to Hyuga, very few of his retainers cared to follow him, even though the failure to do so involved the loss of the revenues they had once enjoyed. On the other hand, three years later, when Matsukura Shigemasu came to take possession of the fief, he, according to the usual custom, brought his vassals with him and so had no occasion to employ those left by his predecessor. Koeckebacker, the Superintendent of the Dutch trading factory at Hirado, wrote of these things as follows:

"The servants of the departed prince were then deprived of their income and obliged by poverty to become farmers in order to procure for their wives and children the necessaries of life Although thus becoming peasants in name, they were in reality soldiers well acquainted with the use of weapons. The newly arrived Lord, not content herewith, imposed upon them and upon the other farmers more taxes and forced them to raise such a quantity of rice as was impossible for them to do. Those who could not pay the fixed taxes were dressed by his order in a rough straw coat made of a kind of grass with large and broad leaves and called *mino* by the Japanese, such as is used by boatmen and other peasantry as a rain-coat. These mantles were tied round the neck and body, the hands being tightly bound behind their backs with ropes, after which the straw coats were set on fire. They not only received burns, but some were burnt to death; others killed themselves by bumping violently against the ground or drowning themselves. This tragedy is called the 'Mino dance.' This revengeful tyrant, not content with his cruelty, ordered women to be suspended quite naked by the legs, and caused them to be scoffed at in various other ways."

The new Lord of Arima exhibited like cruelty towards those whose only offence was a belief in Christianity. He soon gained the reputation of being the most successful extorter of recantations that Japan had yet seen. His son, Matsukura Shigetsugu, who succeeded him in 1630, imitated his father's virulence against the Christians, but was not so skilful a ruler. He was dissolute and luxurious, so that he exacted from the people heavier taxes than had before been known. It is said that even his own soldiers were so financially burdened that they had to engage in menial labour in order to provide themselves with the necessities of life. Koeckebacker in the letter already quoted said:

"As the present Lord, who resides in Yedo, feels also inclined to follow in the footsteps of his father and forces the farmers to pay more taxes than they are able to do, in such a manner that they \[anguish from hunger, taking only some roots and vegetables for nourishment, the people resolved not to bear any longer the vexations, and to die one single death instead of the many slow deaths to which they were subjected. Some of the principal amongst them have killed with their own hands their wives and children in order not to view any longer the disdain and infamy to which their relatives were subjected."

Evidently everything was ready for revolt if leaders could be found. There is said to have been preserved among the Christians the following prophecy left by one of the missionaries who had been driven from Amakusa about 1612.

"When five times five years have passed, a remarkable youth will appear. Without study he shall of himself know all things, and he shall be famous throughout the land. Then shall the clouds of the east and west shine with a ruddy glow, wistaria flowers shall blossom from the trunks of dead trees. Multitudes shall bear the cross on their helmets, white flags shall float over sea and river, mountain and plain. Then shall come the time for Jesus to be honoured."

In 1637, strange appearances in the sky and unusual blossoms in the gardens seemed to coincide with the signs foretold by this prophecy. Neither was there lacking a person that was thought to answer to the description of the promised deliverer. His name was Masuda Shiro, the son of one of the Christian warriors that had left the province of Higo at the time of the persecution under Kato Kiyomasa. The boy had been brought up in Nagasaki, and it is probable that what he learned there from the missionaries and other foreigners enabled him to astonish the people of Amakusa by a display of wisdom. It was asserted that he could walk upon the sea, make birds fly down from the sky to light on his hand, cause stags to issue from a sea-shell, and perform many other miracles.

Five of the former retainers of Konishi are mentioned as leaders of the movement in Amakusa. They began by holding meetings in which they spoke to the peasants-concerning this young man who had come to inaugurate a movement that would result in the firm establishment of Christianity in Japan, China, and India. They promised that those who became his first followers would be given high honour and office in the new kingdom soon to be set up, while all who opposed him would miserably perish.

In the months of November and December, 1637, the agitation gradually assumed a more violent character. In several villages the peasants attacked the public granaries and took possession of the rice that had been collected by the tax-gatherers. By the end of the year five or six thousand men were in arms, the larger part of them besieging the castle of Tomeoka. Terasawa's lieutenant, Miyake Tobei, who had received early warning of the danger, sent to Kusatsu asking for reinforcements. Fifteen hundred men, who attempted to come to his aid, were intercepted by the insurgents and defeated in three successive engagements. A portion of them, however, managed to enter the castle, where they also succeeded in repelling an assault made January 7, 1638, by the insurgents.

In this assault the rebels of Amakusa were assisted by some from Shimabara, for Shiro and his advisers had extended their agitation to that peninsula. News that the peasants were holding meetings reached the officials, who surprised a company of farmers and arrested two of their leaders. As it was supposed that these last would be immediately put to death, their associates came together to perform funeral rites. When an officer attempted to interfere with them, he was torn to pieces by the angry people. This was on the eleventh of December. Word of what had happened was at once sent to other villages. In these, too, the people arose, killing officers and destroying temples. On the twelfth of December, a part of the city of Shimabara was burned, and the insurgents then laid siege to its castle.

When intelligence of these events reached the central government, there was great fear lest the insurrction might become general throughout the land. The Shogun's brother was sent to Sendai that he might be on the watch for any indications of trouble in that region. Other officials were sent to Nagasaki, while Itakura Shigemasa was ordered to put down the insurrection in Amakusa and Shimabara by the help of troops collected from neighbouring daimiates.

As there was little reason to hope that in the absence of artillery the castles of Tomeoka and Shimabara could be taken, Masuda decided to occupy and repair an old deserted castle at Hara, twenty miles from the city of Shimabara. This was situated on a high bluff whose cliffs on three sides descended for a hundred feet perpendicularly to the sea, while the fourth side was partly protected by a swamp. Two deep moats across the narrow ridge of land that led to the bluff formed an important part of its defence, Japanese accounts of the struggle say that twenty thousand men, together with seventeen thousand women and children, gathered in the castle. Dr. Reiss thinks that the whole number could hardly have reached twenty thousand. He supposes that thirty-seven thousand included all that in Shimabara and Amakusa took part in the uprising. All in the castle worked vigorously at strengthening its defences. The movement was now professedly Christian. On the battlements were placed wooden crosses, while flags were marked with the same symbol. The warriors encouraged one another by shouting out the names of Jesus, Mary, and St. James. A letter that at a later date was shot into the camp of the besiegers said:

"For the sake of our people we have now resorted to this castle. No doubt you will think that we have done this for the sake of seizing lands and acquiring houses; but such is by no means the case. It is simply because, as you know, Christianity is not tolerated as a distinct sect. Frequent prohibitions have been published by the Shogun that have greatly distressed us. Some there are among us that consider the hope of future life as of the highest importance. For these there is no escape. Since they will not change their religion, they incur various kinds of severe punishments, being cruelly subjected to shame and extreme suffering until at last, for their devotion to the Lord of Heaven, they are tortured to death. Others, and among them some men of strong will, have been moved by solicitude for their sensitive bodies and through dread of torture have, while hiding their grief, obeyed the will of the Shogun and recanted. While things were in this state, all the people have been moved in an unaccountable and miraculous manner to unite in an uprising. Should we continue to live as hitherto with these laws unrepealed, we must suffer all sorts of fearful punishments. As our bodies are weak and sensitive to pain, we might be led to sin against the infinite Lord of Heaven, and from solicitude for our brief lives incur the loss of what we most value. These things fill us with unbearable grief. Hence we have taken this action. It is not the result of a corrupt doctrine."

Itakura, who had at his disposal a force of over twenty-six thousand men, made an attack upon the castle. The result was a complete failure. None of the insurgents were slain, while Itakura lost six hundred men. A second assault made on the fourteenth of the month was even more disastrous. Though only ninety of the defenders were injured, the attacking force suffered a loss of about five thousand. As Itakura himself was among the slain, Matsudaira *lzu* no Kami was sent to take his place. It was now seen that these so-called "farmers" possessed much military skill as well as bravery. To overcome them an army of over one hundred thousand warriors was collected, Matsudaira received orders not to allow a single Christian, whether man, woman, or child, to escape. At the same tune he was told not to waste unnecessarily the lives of his own soldiers. He therefore determined that for a while he would make no assault on the castle, but would guard its approaches so as to keep the rebels from escaping or obtaining supplies of food. Artificial hills were constructed from which cannon sent frequent shot into the castle, while other cannon were placed on junks that they might fire upon it from the sea. These last accomplished so little that Koeckebacker, the head of the Dutch factory, was "advised" and afterwards commanded to send ships with heavy artillery for taking part in the bombardment, A few years before this, Koeckebacker had made such engagements with the Japanese that he now thought he could not avoid compliance with these orders. He had already sent six cannon, as well as some powder, and, after managing to hurry off two of his three vessels to Formosa, he went with the other, a ship with twenty guns, to help in the reduction of Hara. In fifteen days the Dutch fired four hundred and twenty-six shot. Though Koeckebacker says that the conditions were such as prevented his guns from accomplishing very much, the Japanese were surprised at the accuracy of aim, and the insurgents were compelled to dig cellars in which to take refuge from the cannon-balls. Suddenly the Dutch were told that they might withdraw, the reason given to Koeckebacker being that Matsudaira had pity for them on account of the inconvenience they were occasioned by having their homeward voyage delayed. A more probable reason is that some of the daimyos considered it derogatory to their honour that the aid of foreigners should be thought necessary for suppressing the revolt of a few farmers. Koeckebacker says that the insurgents had shot a letter into the camp of the besiegers asking why, when there were so many brave soldiers in Japan, they had to seek help from the Hollanders.

The rebels had reason to fear treachery. After Itakura's first attack, one of their number, named Yamada, sent word to the besiegers that he and eight hundred others were not real Christians, but had been compelled by popular opinion to take part in the uprising. He therefore proposed a plan by which the besiegers could gain entrance to the castle, promising that in the resulting confusion he would either assassinate Masuda or deliver him into their hands. This plot was discovered, the family of Yamada was put to death, and he was placed in confinement to await the time when the leaders should inflict upon him such punishment as his treachery deserved. When the castle was finally taken, he was found and set free, he being the only person within the fort whose life was spared.

Matsudaira hoped that as the sufferings of hunger began to be felt by those in the castle, others would be found to desert a cause whose helplessness was every day becoming more evident. Notwithstanding that he had been ordered to slay all the Christians, he had a letter shot into the castle promising to those who would surrender themselves that they should have full pardon, if they were not Christians or if they were willing to recant. The letter fell into the hands of the leaders, who at once sent back a reply, saying that, since all in the castle were ready to die for the sake of God, nothing would induce them to give up their faith or to surrender.

The insurgents sustained their courage by religious exercises and by songs of faith or defiance. One of the latter has been preserved:

"While powder and shot remain, continue to chase the besieging army that is blown away before us like the drifting sand. Hear the dull thud of the enemy's guns: ' Don\! Don\! ' Our arms give back the reply: ' By the blessing of God the Father, I will cut off your heads\!'"

A vigorous sortie failed to obtain the provisions that were so much needed. Evidently there could be but one end to such an unequal conflict. The final assault began at noon, April 11, 1638. The insurgents fought desperately until the last. In the absence of ammunition they used stones, billets of wood, kitchen utensils, anything and everything that could be shot from their rude cannon or otherwise employed as a weapon. It was not until the next morning that the besiegers succeeded in taking the castle. They did their best to carry out the grim order for the destruction of old and young. Only one hundred and nine were taken prisoners and they were put to death a few days later. The bodies of the slain were thrown into the sea, but previously the heads had been severed in order that they might be exposed in Nagasaki as a ghastly spectacle to warn all men of the punishment due to rebels. A journal kept by the Dutch in Hirado says that they numbered seventeen thousand. The insurgents were not the only ones punished for the outbreak, Matsukura, whose tyranny had been one of its causes, was ordered to commit *harakiri.* From Terasawa were taken away parts of his territory and revenues. He soon after became insane and took his own life.

This revolt led the Government to put forth all its efforts for the suppression of Christianity. The feudal lords sought more energetically than before to apprehend any believers that might be in their territories. The news of the extermination of those who had fought at Hara in the names of Christ and Mary so disheartened others who had before been numbered among the Christians that they had little courage to meet the new trial to which they were exposed. Nearly all who remained in the country made at least a pretence of returning to the old religions.\* Yet from time to time, believers were discovered. In 1639, Father Pedro Cassoui, a Japanese Jesuit, was put to death in the *fosse;* and Father Porro, an Italian Jesuit, was burned alive with all the inhabitants of the village where he was found, A Japanese manuscript says that in Nagasaki ten per cent, of the Christians detected were retained in prison to be utilised as witnesses in future trials, ten per cent, were assigned \(probably as slaves\) to informers, and the rest were executed.

Special officers called *Kirishitan bugyo* were appointed to seek out Christians, and various plans were adopted for the detection of those that concealed their faith. One of the most effective devices was that known as *efumi* \(picture-trampling\). It is not certain when this was introduced. References to it are found as early as 1658. Suspected persons were ordered to tread upon a cross or upon a picture of Christ. Those shrinking from the act of irreverence were recognised as followers of the proscribed religion. In 1669, a copper tablet with a representation of Christ was substituted in Nagasaki for the picture. Similar ones were afterwards used in other places. Thunberg, who came to Japan in 1775, says that once a year in Nagasaki, the inspectors assembled the inhabitants of each ward, calling them by name and making them step on the image. Infant children were brought by their mothers and held in such a way that their feet touched the tablet. Thus they were taught from their earliest days to despise and hate the religion that it symbolised. Four days were occupied in this ceremony, and then the plate was carried to the neighbouring villages, Thunberg denies, as others have done, the assertion that the Dutch merchants were obliged to trample on the picture and that they were willing to do it rather than lose their trade.\*

In time the Christians adopted various subterfuges for avoiding the tests or for reconciling their consciences to an outward observance of the ceremonies. It is said that in some places the Christians, after trampling on the picture, would wash their feet and then drink the water, returning thanks that they had been permitted to touch the sacred emblem.

One result of the Shimabara Revolt was that the Portuguese, being suspected of having encouraged it, were forbidden to come any more to Japan. In 1639, orders were given that, if a Portuguese ship should come, it must be destroyed and all persons on board be immediately beheaded. Notice was given to the Dutch and Chinese that their ships would be confiscated if any Christian teachers were found upon them. The Dutch were also ordered to give information if they knew of missionaries being brought by the vessels of any other nation.

The Portuguese merchants of Macao, greatly disturbed at the loss of such a profitable trade, finally decided to send to Japan four of the most honourable men of the colony, who should bear rich presents, declare that the Portuguese had no connection with the revolt, and ask that commerce be renewed. It was recognised that those taking part in this expedition were running great risks. In all the churches of the city special religious services were held in their behalf. The envoys, their attendants, and the sailors received the sacraments before starting. No one was permitted on the ship who did not have a certificate showing that he had been to the confessional.

The vessel reached Nagasaki July 16, 1640. The Japanese at once surrounded it with guard-boats; removed rudder, sails, and ammunition; and placed the Portuguese under a guard of soldiers until an answer could be received from the report of the affair that was sent to Yedo. When the answer came, it was as follows:

"The crimes committed for many years by these men while promulgating Christianity in disregard of the Shogun's decrees are very numerous and exceedingly grave. Last year the Shogun forbade under the severest penalties that any one should come from Macao to Japan, and he decreed that, in case any vessel should come in disregard of the prohibition, it should be burned, while all the sailors and passengers, without any exception, should be put to death. All these points have been provided for, drawn up in articles, and published in due form. Nevertheless, by coming in this ship, these men have disregarded the decree and have also greatly prevaricated. Moreover, however much they may assert in words that henceforth they will send no teacher of the Christian religion, it is certain that the letters from Macao do not promise this. Since it is solely because of the Christian religion that the Shogun has rigorously forbidden this navigation, and since in the despatches from the Portuguese city the aforesaid promise is not given, it is proved that the whole embassy is only an out-and-out lie. Consequently all persons coming in the ship have merited death, and none ought to be left to report the catastrophe. It is ordered that the ship be burned and that the chiefs of the embassy with all their attendants be put to death, so that the report of this example may reach even to Macao and Europe, and that the whole world may learn to respect the majesty of the Shogun. Nevertheless, we wish that the lowest persons of the crew shall be spared and sent back to Macao. If by any chance or by accident at sea any ship of the Portuguese should come to Japan, let it he known that, no matter at what port a landing is made, all on board to the very last man shall be put to death."

In accordance with this sentence, the four envoys and fifty-seven other persons were beheaded August 3, 1640. The thirteen whose lives were spared witnessed the execution and also the burning of the ship. The next day they were taken to identify the heads of the slain. Near the places where these were exposed tablets had been erected, on one of which was an account of the embassy and the reason for the execution of those connected with it. The second had this inscription:

"Thus is it that hereafter shall be punished with death all those coming to this Empire from Portugal, whether they be ambassadors or common sailors, and even though it be through mistaking the way or because of a tempest that they come; yea, every such person shall perish, even though he be the King of Portugal, or Buddha, or a Japanese God, or the Christians' God Himself; yea, all shall die."\*

The survivors were given an opportunity of going back to Macao on a Dutch ship, but not wishing "to be under obligations to those infidels," they preferred to take passage on a fragile craft that after a perilous voyage reached Macao September 20, 1640.

"The whole city," says Pagés, "received their message with the most admirable sentiments, and rendered solemn thanks to God for having made the ambassadors of earth ambassadors to heaven. The families of the slain occupied the places of honour at the festivals. To the sound of church-bells and artillery, the hymn of glory broke forth on the air and carried to the feet of the Almighty the Christian joy of the people together with their resigned and grateful adoration"

Not yet would the Portuguese give up all hope of resuming trade. In December, 1640, their country, having become independent of Spain, installed a king of its own. The envoy sent from Macao to congratulate him on his accession urged him to send an ambassador to Japan. This was done in 1647. As the two vessels that accompanied him refused to give up rudder and arms, a large force of Japanese gathered to guard them. The ships were finally permitted to depart without injury, hut nothing was accomplished by the embassy.

As the English factory had been discontinued, the Dutch were now the only Europeans remaining in Japan. They did not escape suspicion, notwithstanding their attempts to make it plain that their religion was very different from that of the Spanish and Portuguese. In 1040, they came very near getting into serious trouble through having inscribed the Christian date on a new warehouse they erected in Hirado. It may he, as suggested by Kaempfer, that this edifice, being unusually high and built of stone, was suspected of being made as much for a fortress as for a warehouse. Some of the enemies of the Dutch took this occasion for having an official inspection of the factory, turning over all the goods in hope that some religious wares might be found that would serve as an excuse for making an armed attack upon the merchants. Nothing of the kind was discovered, but orders were given that the warehouse bearing the obnoxious inscription should be torn down. The Dutch director had the good sense to comply, and thus a conflict was avoided. The next year the factory was removed to Nagasaki. The Dutch had long desired to gain entrance to this port, but they soon found that, instead of the comparative freedom they had enjoyed in Hirado, they were to be hardly better than prisoners on the little island of Deshima, almost entirely cut off from communication with the Japanese, and hampered by many annoying regulations. Though these varied from time to time, they were in general for the next two centuries very much the same that are described by such writers as Thunberg, Kaempfer, and Siebold, When a Dutch ship arrived, it had to give over its rudder and armament to the Japanese. A list of all persons on board was required, and frequent inspections were made to see that none were absent. Bibles, prayer books, and other objects having connection with the Christian religion were enclosed in a chest to be put in the care of the Japanese, or else hidden where it would escape their notice. All persons who went on shore were carefully searched to see that they carried no contraband goods. At one time the captains of ships were exempt from such inspection. It is said that they became noted for their corpulency; cloaks and trousers being made of such immense proportions that they afforded room for a good-sized cargo to be taken to and from shore in the three visits that were made each day. Thunberg says that sometimes the captains went so heavily loaded that they had to be supported under the arms by sailors who walked at their side. The commander of the vessel in which he came to Japan had made due preparation to avail himself of this custom; but to his disgust he found, on reaching Nagasaki, that new regulations made this convenient method of smuggling impossible. Japanese officials held the keys of the warehouses at Deshima. The gate leading to the bridge that connected the island with Nagasaki was closely guarded. No one could pass it without the Governor's permission. Once or twice a year the prisoners were allowed to take a walk on shore, and embassies were sent annually to Yedo. No Japanese \(except public women\) were allowed to live in the houses of the foreigners, or even to visit them. For a long time the Dutch were not allowed to bury their dead on land, but the bodies were sunk at sea. Shortly before Kaempfer came in 1690, this rule was relaxed and a burial place on land granted, though the ground was kept level so that there was nothing to distinguish the location of the graves. The Hollanders were very careful to make it evident that their religion was not that of the Spanish and Portuguese. Kaempfer says that they had "to leave off praying and singing of psalms in public, entirely to avoid the sign of the cross, the calling upon Christ in the presence of the natives, and all the outward marks of Christianity."

The Jesuits in Macao were as desirous as the merchants to re-enter Japan. In 1642, ten of their number decided that the time had come for making an attempt. Their leader, Father Anthony Rubin, had been appointed "Visitor of China and Japan." He resolved to go to the latter of these countries. When his friends protested against such a dangerous and almost hopeless undertaking, he replied that the duties of his office left him no choice, for he ought to visit in person the places for which he had been made responsible. He felt under a special obligation to seek out Ferreyra, the Jesuit who had apostatised and who might perhaps be led to repentance.

It was decided that those joining in the enterprise should divide into two bands. The first was composed of Fathers Rubin, Moralez, Capece, Mecinske, and Francesco Marquez. They were accompanied by three persons not belonging to the Society, who volunteered to share the dangers of the expedition. One of these, De Souza, was a Portuguese; one named Thomas was a Korean; while the third, named Juan, was a native of India, The party set out July 5, 1642. All the priests were disguised as Chinese. Though the pretended destination of their boat was Formosa, it took its passengers to a small island belonging to the province of Satsuma, On landing, they knelt down and kissed the ground. It was not long before they were discovered and taken to Nagasaki. When brought before the Governor of the city, they found that the interpreter was the apostate priest whose recovery had been one object of their coming. Father Rubin, who acted as spokesman, replied to all questions and also reproved Ferreyra so severely for his conduct that the apostate was too much ashamed to remain in the room. The captives were subjected to various tortures intended to make them give up their faith.

Several months of imprisonment and torture did not avail to shake the steadfastness of these brave men. Finally, in March, 1643, sentence of death was pronounced against them. They were then placed on horseback, with their hands tied behind them and their mouths so gagged that they could not speak to one another nor to the people on the street. On their backs was placed the inscription, "The Shogun condemns these persons to death for propagating the Christian religion, which has long been condemned." Led to the place of execution, they were subjected to the punishment of the *fosse.* It is said that several days elapsed ere death ended their sufferings.

After the news of this martyrdom reached Macao, the second group of Jesuits set out under the leadership of father Peter Marquez, who had been appointed Father Rubin's successor. His companions were Fathers Arroyo, Cassola, and Chiara, besides a Japanese Brother named Vieyra. According to Roman Catholic histories, they first went to Loochoo and thence were taken to Yedo, where three of them were put to death, while the others were remanded to a prison in which they soon after died. Japanese accounts, whose general accuracy is undoubted, tell a far different story. According to these, the Jesuits were arrested in 1643, in Chi-kuzen, the northeastern province of Kyushu. With them were five Japanese catechists. All were sent to Nagasaki and in the following year to Yedo. The six Japanese soon consented to abandon Christianity. The foreigners also, after being put to torture, recanted, repeated an invocation to Buddha, and signed a declaration that there was no deception in their professed apostasy. They were thereafter kept in a prison that was constructed for them in the mansion of Inoue Chikugo no Kami, who was the chief of a commission for the suppression of Christianity. This prison was beside a steep lane that about that time received the name Kirishitan-zaka \(Christian Slope\) by which it is still known. One of the priests \(Arroyo\) after a while retracted his denial of Christianity, and soon after this he died. Peter Marquez died in 1657. Cassola and Chiara married Japanese women. To Chiara were transferred the name and swords of a criminal who had suffered capital punishment. Chiara died in 1685, at the age of eighty-four, and was buried at Muryoin, a temple near Kirishitan-zaka, where is still to be seen his grave-stone, the top of which is shaped like the hat worn by a Jesuit missionary. Vieyra died in 1678, aged seventy-nine, and was buried at the same temple. The Japanese records mention the arrest on an island near Chikuzen of a Sicilian priest, who was induced to apostatise. He was confined in the same place with the others, dying there in 1700.\*

Five Dominican friars are said to have set forth in 1647 from Manila in the attempt to get into Japan. Little is known about this enterprise, except that it was unsuccessful.

Some attempts were made to reach the Japanese by way of China. Christian books printed in that country were mingled with others carried by the Chinese merchants. These could be read by well-educated Japanese. In 1687, the Shogun's Government published a list of thirty-eight books whose importation was forbidden. Some of them were simply almanacs, which were objectionable because of casual references to Christianity. It is said that the Chinese also sent porcelain decorated with cryptic designs that could be recognised by the initiated as having Christian significance.

The most daring and romantic attempt to enter the country, so far as we have any record, was that made by Father Sidotti, a native of Palermo. He had, even as a boy, become so deeply interested in the history of the missions to Japan that he determined to carry Christianity again to the land where it had once been so prosperous. While preparing for the priesthood he found some books that enabled him to gain a slight knowledge of the language. Better opportunities for study came during a sojourn that he made in the Philippine Islands, where some shipwrecked sailors from Japan were kindly treated by the colonial government and through the rest of their lives were supported at public expense. They entered the Roman Catholic Church.\*

In August, 1708, through the favour of the Governor, who fitted out a ship for Sidotti's use, he left Manila, and after a long and tedious voyage drew near the shores of Kyushu, where, on the night of October 12, he had himself put on shore. The ship at once returned to Manila, leaving Sidotti alone, one man against a nation. He had dressed himself in the garb of a Japanese of the military class, even to the two swords thrust into his girdle.

The next morning a charcoal-burner on the way to his work heard some one calling to him. On turning around he saw a tall man who was talking and making signs. The peasant was unable to understand the stranger's words, but thought the gestures signified a desire for water. After bringing some, he hurried away to tell the villagers about the strange man he had seen. He soon returned with two companions and took Sidotti to his house, there giving him food but refusing to accept the gold that was offered in payment. It was not long before the matter became known to the officials, who sent the stranger to Nagasaki.

Sidotti's study of Japanese had not given him ability to speak intelligibly. None of the official interpreters were able to communicate with him. Recourse was then had to the Dutch traders, among whom was found one who knew a little Latin. Through him Sidotti was questioned concerning his country and his reasons for coming to Japan. After being kept for nearly a year in Nagasaki, he was sent to Kirishitan-zaka in do. Arai Hakuseki, an officer in the Shogun's Government, has left an interesting account of several interviews that he had with Sidotti. Though the latter's Japanese was a medley of badly pronounced provincialisms, Hakuseki says that he gradually became able to understand what the stranger wished to say.

It was December when Sidotti reached Yedo, He was so thinly dressed that warmer clothing was offered to him, a kindness that he refused to accept because, as he was understood to say, his religion did not allow him to receive gifts from unbelievers. At the close of the first interview he said that it gave him sorrow to think he was causing much trouble to the guards, who remained day and night in the cold prison to prevent his escape.

"Surely, there is no need of this," he said, "for it is not likely that, after voluntarily coming thousands of miles in order to reach Japan, I shall now try to run away. Indeed, where could I go? If an attempt to escape is feared, why cannot you securely chain me every night so that the guards will be free to sleep in comfort?"

The other officials were much moved by this thought-fulness, but Hakuseki said: "This fellow is a liar. In this respect I am much disappointed in him."

Sidotti understood what was said and warmly remonstrated: "There is no more insulting charge than to call a man a liar. Falsehood is forbidden by my religion. From childhood I have never said what is not true. Why do you accuse me of such a sin?"

"Did you not profess sympathy for the guards, who on your account are compelled to endure the severe cold of these winter nights?"

"I did."

"Therefore did I accuse you of deceit. You profess to have sympathy for the guards, and yet you do not hesitate to cause them great anxiety by your refusal to accept warmer clothing. You pain them by this rejection of their kindness."

"I acknowledge," said the priest, "that I made a mistake. I will accept the clothes; only, I pray yon, let them be of cotton and not of silk."

Hakuseki was evidently greatly impressed by Sidotti's character, and enjoyed having long interviews with him, especially since he was thus able to satisfy his curiosity concerning foreign lands. He presented to the Government a report in which he gave the main points of their conversation. An account of what he learned from Sidotti about foreign customs has been preserved. Among other things it contains an outline of Christian doctrine.

In a memorial that Hakuseki sent to the Government he said: "According to my humble opinion, there are but three ways of dealing with the prisoner. These I shall describe as the best, the intermediate, and the worst. The first and best way is to release him and send him home. The intermediate plan is to imprison him for life. The third and worst of all is to kill him at once. "In recommending mercy, he said: "The stranger was born in a country where that odious religion prevails. The education that he received has become a second nature to him, and he cannot be blamed for not discerning that his religion is unreasonable and false. He is not personally blameworthy if, at the command of a superior authority, he left his old mother, sixty-eight years of age, and a brother also well advanced in life, that he might come to this land where he was in danger of being put to death and where he has lived for six years among the perils and distresses that have come upon him. The steadfastness of his determination is to be admired, I cannot but wonder at his resoluteness and the persistency of his purpose. To put him to death under these circumstances would be like shedding innocent blood."

He further asserted that humane hearts could not endure to think of having Sidotti confined for the rest of his life in a narrow prison. If those who sent him should learn that he was alive, they would think the prohibitions against foreigners were being relaxed, and so others would be encouraged to come; and on the other hand, if no information concerning his fate reached them, they would send messengers to inquire about him. Hence, the best plan would be to deport him to the Philippines or to China, with a warning that the laws would be rigorously enforced against any others that ventured to come to Japan.

In disregard of Hakuseki's advice, Sidotti was kept a prisoner. In the house where he was confined lived a man named Chosuke and his wife Haru, both of whom had once been employed as Chiara's servants.\* Though they were not believers in the forbidden religion, their employment by such a person was considered a sufficient reason for not permitting them to leave the place. When Sidotti had been four or five years in Yedo, these persons confessed to the officials that through his influence they had been converted and that he had baptised them. They said: "When our former master was alive, he secretly taught us his doctrines; but we did not know that in so doing he was acting contrary to the laws of the land. Now in our old age we have seen how this Roman, in disregard of his own life and for the sake of religion, has come many thousand miles to this land where he has been imprisoned; and, loath as we are to lose the little that remains of life, the knowledge of what a fearful thing it is to fall into hell has led us to receive his instruction and become believers. As it would be opposing the goodness of the Government not to acknowledge these things, we make our confession. Whatever the consequences may be to us, we ask that we may be dealt with according to the law."

The two servants were confined in separate rooms and Sidotti was put in chains. He supposed that they would be executed, and as they were within hearing, he often shouted out, urging them to be faithful unto death. Both Sidotti and Chosuke died in 1715.†

The "Annals of the Propagation of the Faith" \(Eng. ed., 1849, p. 215\), after speaking of Sidotti says: "Subsequently to this an attempt of the same kind was made and the result is not known." Possibly this notice may refer to four mysterious persons who are said to have appeared in Cochin China about the end of the eighteenth century, saying that they were missionaries to Japan. They asked the Vicar Apostolic to give them some sacred vestments, but insisted on the utmost secrecy. Nothing more is known about them.\*

Apparently persecution had attained its object and wholly extirpated the religion against which it was directed. So it seemed to Europeans, save as there remained among Roman Catholics a lingering hope, nourished by one or two incidents hereafter to be noted that some secret believers in Christianity yet remained; so it seemed to the Japanese, except as now and then suspicion arose against the inhabitants of certain villages whose customs had some strange peculiarities. References to the hated religion were not permitted in books, and its very name might have been almost forgotten were it not written so prominently on the public proclamation-boards of every town. As soon as a child could read, he saw upon the boards that the KIRISHITAN JASHU-MON \(Evil Sect of Christianity\) was strictly prohibited, and when he asked what this meant, he was told by his parents about the wily scheme of the barbarian nations that sought to gain possession of Japan by means of a religion that was a strange compound of foolish doctrines and powerful magic.

Thus the close of this stage in the history of Christianity in Japan left it as a religion that seemed to have been thoroughly defeated and whose very name was enough to excite the derision and hatred of those that heard it.

In connection with the funeral of the Empress Dowager, the Japanese Red Cross Society made preparations to care for any persons among the immense crowds viewing the procession who might be injured. Its tents were set up before the Temple of the Great Buddha and almost within the shadow of the Mimizuka, a mound under which were buried the ears of Koreans that had been sent back by Hideyoshi's soldiers to show the number of the enemy they had slain. In strange contrast with the spirit that led to the erection of that mound and with the event related in the text, there floated over these tents white flags bearing what though once the most hated emblem in Japan, is now honoured as that of the Red Cross Society, which, though not distinctively Christian, owes it origin to the influence of Him who transformed the cross from a thing of shame into a symbol of love.

\* Possibly this delay of two years before taking more vigorous measures against the prisoners was owing in part to negotiations that Takenaka had begun with the Philippines. Both he and Matsukura had sent envoys to consult about the renewal of commerce. The Spanish Governor suspected that the real purpose was to spy out the land before making an attack upon it. Though he received the visitors with a great show of cordiality, he took care to show them the forts, arsenals, and troops, so as to impress them with the military power of the colony. His suspicions were not unreasonable, for, though he probably did not know it, Matsukura had shortly before this sent a memorial to Yedo asking that he be allowed to invade the Philippines.

\* The "Nagasaki Sambyakunen-kan," from which I take these directions, says "Descendants of the Fathers" \(*Bateren no shison\),* but as afterwards it speaks of two hundred and eighty-seven children of the Portuguese who were sent to Macao, we may suppose that there has been a mistake in copying.

\* Some of the Christians escaped to Macao, the Philippines, Siam, and other countries. About 1666, Japanese who had taken refuge in Siam told of three hundred and seventy of their fellow-believers in Japan who had been put to death the previous year. They said that, although the absence of priests prevented the reception of the sacraments, the fervour of the Christians was ever on the increase. The Bishop in Siam asked the Japanese to write to their friends at home, assuring them of his sympathy and of his readiness to admit to holy order-: any fit for the priesthood who would come to Siam. *Relatione delle Missione de Vescovi Vicarii,* Rome, 1677, as quoted in Trans.

A more common version reads somewhat as follows; "So long as the sun warms the earth et no Christian be so bold as to come to Japan; and let all know that if the King of Spain, or the Christians' God, or the great God of all violate this command, he shall pay for it with his head.

\* The accounts of these missionaries were drawn from Japanese sources by Sir Ernest Satow \(Trans. As. Soc., vol. vi., pp. 56-62\).

Soc., vol. xvi., p. 207, and in an article in the *Toyo Gakugei Zasshi,* No. 83, reproduced in the *Romaji Zasshi,* Nos. 40 and 41. The latter speaks of a Brother from Canton, named John, who was arrested at the same time as Chiara, was imprisoned with him, and died in 1697 \(cf. Satow's paper, p. 58\). It also says that in 1675 Chiara was ordered to become a Buddhist but refused to do so; also, that his widow died in 1695.

In *The Month* for May, 1905, Rev. Herbert Thurston, after bringing together the reasons that may be adduced for hoping that the Japanese accounts are incorrect, feels obliged to say: "Reviewing, however, the evidence as a whole, it can hardly be doubted that some sort of renunciation of Christianity was extorted from one or more of the Jesuit missionaries by the extremity of their tortures."

### JAPANESE TRADITIONS OF THE EARLY MISSIONS



IF history is that version of a story which has been able to gain general acceptance, we shall expect to find that what the Japanese have until recently understood to be the history of Christianity in their country is far different from that which is narrated in European books. During most of the Tokugawa period, all publications containing references to the hated religion were prohibited. There lingered among the people various traditions that were sometimes recorded in manuscripts intended for private circulation. The following narrative is compiled from several manuscripts of the eighteenth century, and shows what stories were current among the people.\* Owing to the difficulty of identifying names, and the confused state of the narratives, it is not easy to connect these accounts with those derived from the letters of the missionaries. It may be conjectured that "Urugan and Furaten" were Fathers Organtin and Froez, who, though not the first to preach in Kyoto, were among the best known of the missionaries, and for this reason the traditions may have gathered about their names. Europeans were known as Southern Barbarians because they approached Japan from the south.

In some of the family records of the daimyos and in other manuscripts the name of Xavier is found, and there are a few other references to the missionaries; but so far as these documents have been made public, they add hut little to our knowledge of events directly connected with the propagation of Christianity.

One day the King of Southern Barbary said to his council: "I am told that far to the east lies a country called Japan and that it abounds in gold, silver, and precious stones. Why should not that land be subjugated and added to my domains?"

"Furnish me with an army," said one of his generals, "and I promise to conquer it for you."

Another general, however, advised caution. "It would be a great mistake," said he, "to make a direct attack upon Japan. Hitherto there have been many attempts to conquer that country. At one time the Mongols went with a vast fleet and a great force of soldiers; but the guardian gods of Japan sent forth a mighty wind that destroyed the ships, so that only three persons escaped with their lives. In my opinion, the best way to make ourselves masters of the land is by means of our religion. Send thither some wise priests who, by healing the sick, giving alms to the poor, and practising magic, shall win the esteem of the people. When a third of the inhabitants have been gained, we can depend upon their helping the army that should then be sent to occupy the country. The Japanese are too brave warriors to be overcome by force of arms, and so you must be content to adopt slow but sure methods."

"What you say seems reasonable," the King said, "but it would require a person of great sagacity to manage such a delicate business as your plan proposes."

"Twenty-five hundred miles west from here," the genera\] replied, "dwell two learned priests named Urugan and Furaten. If you could only induce them to go to Japan, you might rest assured of success."

The King at once sent messengers to call the priests to his palace. In the interview that followed, Urugan said: "The plan proposed is excellent, but we must move cautiously. You should first send out merchants who, by selling cheaply such goods as are pleasing to the Japanese, will gain their good will. On their second voyage I will go with them. Too much haste would spoil everything."

In accordance with this advice, two ships were despatched to Japan. Three priests accompanied the expedition in order to learn the condition of the country and to prepare the way for Urugan. In 1542, these ships reached Funai. While the merchants were selling their goods at less than cost, the priests quietly taught their religion, special advantages in trade being given to those that became converts.

On the second voyage, Urugan accompanied the merchants. He received from the King the following articles to be used as presents to the ruler of Japan:— a telescope with which a man one hundred and eighty miles distant could be clearly seen, a microscope, two hundred tiger-skins, twenty guns, one hundred pounds of aloes-wood, a number of rosaries, and a mosquito-net that would cover a space twelve feet square and yet would fold into a box measuring two inches each way.

These ships reached Nagasaki in 1568. Whenever Urugan and another priest that came with him walked about the streets, crowds flocked to see the strange-looking foreigners. Reports of them spread far and wide, at last reaching Nobunaga, who had a great desire to meet the strangers. As, however, the western provinces had not submitted to him, he feared that any request to have the priests sent to Kyoto would be refused and thus he would be put to shame. He therefore sent a messenger, who pretended to come from the Shogun with orders to the officials of Nagasaki that the barbarians should be forwarded to Kyoto, The supposed command was obeyed; but just before the priests reached the capital they were met by some of Nobunaga's retainers and taken to a temple near his castle.

Urugan was soon invited to an audience. On a raised platform in the reception room of the castle was seated Nobunaga, while below him were the members of his family and his chief retainers. All looked with curiosity on the strange guest. He was over seven feet high, with a small head, red cheeks, round yellow eyes, high nose, long ears, broad lips, wide mouth, and teeth like those of a horse. His words were unintelligible, but sounded like the cooing of a dove. In reply to the question why he had come to Japan, he said:

"In order that I may preach Buddha's law, and I request that you will give me permission to do so freely."

After honourably entertaining the stranger and promising to take his petition into consideration, Nobunaga allowed him to return to the temple. He then called a council of his retainers, to which were also summoned several Buddhist and Confucian scholars that he might have their advice about allowing the barbarians to teach their doctrines. For a time all were silent. Then a learned Buddhist priest said:

"This barbarian is a mean-looking fellow, who is evidently unworthy to be a religious teacher. When the founder of Buddhism vanquished the demons that opposed him, they took refuge in foreign lands, where they continued to practise their magic arts, and it was probably from them that this man received instruction, Since Japan has already received Buddhism in its completeness, it has no need of this new doctrine, which is doubtless heretical."

After a little reflection, Nobunaga said: "I should like to see what would come from his preaching. Buddhism first came to us from a foreign land; and unless we give these strangers a fair chance, we cannot tell but that their doctrine is valuable. If any evil should appear in connection with their teaching it will then be easy to prohibit it. I shall allow them to preach."

Not only did Nobunaga grant the request of the foreigners, but he also gave them a piece of land in Kyoto for the erection of a church. When this was built, it received the name Eiroku Temple. The Buddhist priests of Mount Hiei were much enraged that this title, which was that of the current era, had been given to the church. When they urged their abbot to protest he replied:

"There is something about this new temple that I do not understand. What is taught there is apparently heretical. If we wait a little, the thing will probably come to an end of itself. At present the military power is so much in the ascendency that even Buddhism and the Imperial Court have to submit to its dictation. Should we make any trouble over the name of the temple, the only result would be to excite Nobunaga's anger. It will be better to let the matter rest for a while,"

When the priests, who were displeased at the abbot's timidity, came together for a conference, one of their number said:

"The year after the Emperor Kwammu established his capital at Kyoto \[a. d. 794\], he ordered this temple to be built in order that it might protect his palace from the evil influences that come from the north-east. He bestowed upon it the name of his era, a distinction such as no other temple has ever enjoyed. Once, indeed, a temple in Yamato took the name of the era in which it was built, but the priests of our mountain went thither and smashed the tablet on which the title was inscribed. This act of Nobunaga and the barbarians is an insult to the Emperor and to our temple. We must bestir ourselves to uphold our honour."

Excited by these words, over a thousand priests put on armour beneath their robes, while others brought forth the sacred cars; and all hastened towards the Imperial Palace to make their complaint. The Emperor, alarmed at the tumult, summoned his council, who advised that Nobunaga be ordered to have the obnoxious title changed. Henceforth the church was to be known as Nambanji \(Temple of the Southern Barbarians\).

Nobunaga was very angry at this interference of the priests. His resentment was increased by the aid they gave his enemies, and reached its height a few years later when one of their number attempted to assassinate him.

"Both Buddhist and Shinto priests," he declared, "have gained so much wealth that they give themselves over to luxury and idleness. They lay up military stores and sometimes take part in battles. They ought to be shorn of their power."

In accordance with these words he confiscated the lands of many temples; but his chief vengeance was directed against Mount Hiei, whose priests were massacred and the temples burned.

In response to Urugan's request for more missionaries, Furaten came to Japan accompanied by two Brothers who were skilful physicians. The Temple of the Southern Barbarians was now in a flourishing condition. It was richly ornamented with gold, silver, and precious stones. Rich banners hung from the ceilings. The fragrance of burning incense filled the air and penetrated to the street. The missionaries sent out men to hunt up beggars, widows, orphans, outcasts, and lepers. Ail such were brought to the temple, where alms were given to the poor and medicine to the sick. To the multitude thus aided the priests said:

"We came here by order of the King of Southern Barbary, a country a hundred times larger than Japan, whose people, being believers in the true God, never suffer from disease. The land produces many medicinal herbs that are used for the benefit of heathen countries Because you do not believe in the Lord of Heaven, you have been punished by these diseases, and we will show you how much more terrible things await you in the next world."

So saying, they took from its wrapping a large mirror on which they bade their hearers look. The people saw with terror that they were reflected as having the forms of birds or beasts. It added to their fear when they were told that this proved that after death they would become inmates of the hell of animals. One of the Brothers then said to them:

"The only way to escape such a sad fate is to believe in the teaching of the Lord of Heaven. We will not urge you to perform the necessary rites unless you desire to do so. It is for you to choose whether or not you will escape from the threatened evil."

When all begged to receive instruction, they were taught the use of the rosary and were assured that by spending seven days and seven nights in repeating prayers they would be cleansed from their sins and thus fitted for further instruction. At the end of the week they were brought to an inner room that was richly adorned with gold and pearls. There also were Urugan and Furaten clad in golden garments. The Brother that introduced the candidates, said:

"These persons, after being healed of their diseases, have for a week observed the prescribed ceremonies."

"Then," said the priest, "let them be shown a proof of the efficacy of such exercises."

Accordingly the mirror was once more produced, and as the candidates crowded about it, they shed tears of joy when they saw themselves reflected as a company of radiant saints. The priest then said:

"If seven days have wrought so great a change, it cannot be doubted that constancy in the faith will insure the attainment of sainthood. You will now be permitted to worship the chief Deity of the temple. Remember, however, that those who once do this must never let their faith be shaken, even though their bodies should be lacerated by swords or tormented on the rack; for it is only by this God that you can be saved. There remains one more rite to be performed before you can engage in worship."

Each candidate was now presented with a *kurusu* \(cross?\), which was an instrument about two inches square, made of gold and having a handle eighteen inches long. Its surface was studded with nails, making it resemble a horseradish-grater. With these instruments the candidates lacerated their naked bodies, and then they anointed their hands with the flowing blood before joining them in the attitude of prayer.

One of the priests said: "The chief object of Christian worship is Deusu.\* Even the greatest sinner in the world may, through faith in Deusu, go to heaven. You must now engage in His worship."

Urugan then led the way to the "Hall of the Secret Thing." At first the interior was so dark that nothing could be seen.

"Let all approach and worship," said the priest. "You must first repeat the prayer that you have been taught."

When the candidates had said the prayer about three hundred times, the curtain slowly lilted, so as to admit more and more light, until the radiance was like that of noonday The worshippers now saw before them an image of Deusu hanging head-downward upon a cross.

"This," explained the priest, "is the image of our Lord and shows how He suffered for us." The candidates were next taken to the "Hall of Meeting where was the image of a beautiful woman crowned with gems and holding a child. This was explained to mean that, just as a mother embraces her child, so does God love and care for mankind. The worshippers, joining their blood-stained hands, shed tears of thankful joy. Those who so desired were permitted, after inscribing their names in a book, to return home. From those who chose to live in the temple several were selected to receive instruction in medicine and magic. Among these were three men, who by their dissolute habits had been reduced to beggary and afflicted with leprosy. They had now been healed, and on embracing the new religion had received the names Hiyan, Kosumo, and Shimon \(John Cosmo, and Simon\). Under the disguise of merchants or priests, they went about the country practising magic and saying to the people: "Through the benevolence of the foreign physicians, all diseases are freely healed at the Temple of the Southern Barbarians. Not only are poor patients supported while there, but money is also given to their wives and children. Change your religion and become followers of Deusu."

Thus many poor people were led to the temple. The new religion also began to make considerable headway among the upper classes. At last Nobunaga, becoming apprehensive of evil, said to his officers:

"There are beginning to be bad reports about the foreign temple. Its methods are very peculiar. In Buddhism contributions are made to the temples; but who ever heard of a temple that gave alms to the people?

This new religion is gaining too much influence over men's hearts. I am considering the question whether it would not be better to destroy the temple and send the barbarians home. What is your opinion?"

One of the councillors replied: "There is indeed much reason for apprehension, Christianity is gaining many adherents even among the nobility. Yet, since any movement against the temple might lead to an insurrection, it would be better to conceal your suspicious until a favourable time comes for taking vigorous action."

Nobunaga, who agreed with this view, said: "I made the greatest mistake of my life when I permitted the barbarians to teach their doctrines."

Among the prominent persons that became Christians was Takayama Ukon, A revolt having arisen against Nobunaga, Takayama was about to join the rebels; but Nobunaga said to Urugan:

"You assert that your religion teaches righteousness. How then does it happen that Takayama is about to rebel? Unless this wickedness is prevented, you shall no longer be permitted to preach."

The barbarians therefore said to Takayama: "This insurrection is so sure to fail that it would be folly for you to take part in it. Moreover, such a rebellion is contrary to the precepts of our religion."

As a result of their expostulations, Takayama became a leading supporter of Nobunaga, who was thus led to regard Christianity with renewed favour.

When Hideyoshi came into power he was urged to prohibit the foreign religion. He replied that he did not have time then to give the matter such careful consideration as he hoped to do after his authority was fully established.

In Yodo, a few miles from Kyoto, lived a noted architect named Shuri, who had been put in charge of Hideyoshi's extensive building operations. It seemed to the Christians that by gaining this man to their faith a way might be opened for reaching Hideyoshi himself. Hiyan finally decided upon a method of procedure. Knowing that the architect was seldom at home, he one day just at sunset appeared before the gate of Shuri's house. An attendant was sent in to say that a priest from Kyoto had been belated on his return from the provinces, and being timid about travelling after dark, asked for lodging. Shuri's aged mother, who was in charge of the house, did all that she could for the worthy entertainment of such a guest. The next morning, when he was engaged in his devotions, she thought it strange that he paid no attention to the family shrine, where she had carefully lighted the lamps and the incense. After eating breakfast and returning profuse thanks for the hospitality he had received, Hiyan continued on his way to Kyoto.

A few days later a messenger came to Yodo, bringing some beautiful presents in acknowledgment of the favour shown to the belated priest. Though the old lady tried to decline the gifts, the messenger insisted on leaving them. After this, there frequently came letters and presents

Not many months afterwards, Hiyan again appeared one afternoon at Shuri's house, where he stopped to pay his respects. As considerable time was spent in conversation, the old lady said it was too late for the priest to go further; and Hiyan readily assented to an invitation to spend the night. In the evening, while talking about various things, he said to her:

"I do not know to what sect of Buddhism you belong, but the Christian sect is the only one that insures immediate salvation. You ought to become one of its adherents."

"For sixty years," said she, "I have been a devout follower of Amida. I am now too old to think of making a change."

Hiyan, in trying to convince her of the superiority of Christianity, showed her the magic mirror. Though the lady was greatly troubled at what she saw, she simply said:

"I am too ignorant to judge about these matters; but in Kyoto lives a priest who has hitherto been my instructor. If you will sometime meet him here and convince him that what you say is true, I shall then be ready to accept your teaching."

Hiyan gladly consented, for he supposed the priest was some ignorant fellow that could easily be silenced. In reality, he was a very learned man named Haku. All preliminaries having been arranged, Hiyan appeared on the appointed day in splendid apparel. Two of his servants bore a lacquer box that they placed on the floor beside their master. The people of the neighbourhood came in crowds to see what was going on.

After the contestants had saluted each other, Haku asked: "What is the chief object of your worship?"

"We worship Deusu," replied Hiyan, "a divinity who appeared while yet there was nothing in the universe. He created all things. Though men were at first upright, they fell into sin. Deusu had pity on them and gave a prayer by whose repetition they could be saved. Shaka, Amida, and others worshipped in Japan were only men, and so unable to save others. Because Japan does not follow the religion of Deusu, its streets are filled with beggars and outcasts, while its people are afflicted with grievous diseases. Southern Barbary, because of its religion, has no paupers, robbers, nor invalids. If the teaching of Shaka and Amida is true, let them prove it by punishing me for what I am about to do."

So saying, he took from the box at his side some Buddhist books, which he tore into shreds, ground under his feet, spat upon, and otherwise insulted. Then he cried out:

"Do you see what I have done? That I suffer no harm proves your religion to be false. Forsake it, and enter the true way of salvation."

The astonished bystanders held their breath, wondering what Haku would do; but he quietly asked: "Is that all you have to say?"

"There is much more," replied Hiyan, "that I might add; but this is sufficient for the present."

Haku then said with a derisive laugh: "This deity that you call Deusu appears to be very stupid. Instead of creating men and then being obliged to take so much trouble to save them, it would have been better never to have made them at all. The sacred books make no mention of this Deusu, and so your teaching must be heretical. I am not surprised that you could insult the books with impunity. No punishment is sent to rats and mice that gnaw and defile them; for, being only animals, they know no better. If your teaching is more correct than ours, bring me some proof from the sacred books. Come, show me even one such proof."

Hiyan, knowing his inability to meet this challenge, turned red in the face. At last, he took out the magic mirror, saying as he thrust it before Haku:

"Learn from this your true nature and the fate that awaits you in the future life."

Though Haku saw himself reflected as having the head of a horse, he showed no sign of surprise. Taking a flower from a vase, he held it before the mirror. It also appeared as a horse's head. He then asked for a nearer view of the mirror, and Hiyan, suspecting nothing, allowed Haku to take it in his own hands. The latter suddenly turned it around, and the people saw that Hiyan himself was reflected as having a head like that of a horse.

Haku threw down the mirror with a laugh. "In my youth," he said, "such toys were very common. In the process of manufacture, a picture is drawn with lacquer on the surface of the metal, which is then re-heated and polished. Are you not ashamed to deceive people by such tricks?"

Hiyan hung his head; then crying out: "You are a fool and no fit antagonist for me," he was about to leave the room. Haku caught him by the sleeve; but the impostor, freeing himself from the priest's grasp, fled in the direction of Kyoto.

"I had supposed," said Haku, "that it would be necessary to debate concerning astronomy, geography, and other sciences. Since he had recourse to insulting words and acts, I was forced to answer him according to his folly. His doctrine is surely heretical, and in due time the Government will doubtless prohibit such teaching."

Shuri reported these events to Hideyoshi, who soon after ordered the barbarians to be sent home and their temple to be destroyed. The Japanese believers fled to different parts of the country. Hiyan became a mountain priest and went about seeking opportunities for quietly teaching the barbarian religion. Kosumo and Shimon changed their names and became physicians. They also practised legerdemain, being often invited to furnish amusement at banquets. In 1588, Hideyoshi, happening to hear of their skill, called them to exhibit it before him. After they had done many strange things, they offered to show the assembled guests anything that might be desired. The court ladies, to whom the choice was left, asked to see Mount Fuji. To this request the magician said:

"We are unable to bring the mountain into this room; but, if the paper windows can be closed for a minute, we will grant your desire."

The windows were closed, and when, after some words of incantation, they were re-opened, the guests saw that the appearance of the garden had wholly changed, and beyond it they could see the beautiful form of the mountain. After other noted places had been shown in the same way, Hideyoshi said:

"Though there are many stories about ghosts, I have never seen one. Can you make a ghost appear?"

"Ghosts do not appear by daylight," answered the magicians; "but if you will wait until evening, you shall see one."

Accordingly, when the evening's feast was concluded, the magicians caused the candles to be extinguished. The full moon was shining brightly; but soon clouds began to float over its surface, while a chill breeze sighed mournfully through the branches of the trees. Finally, from the deep shade of a clump of shrubbery in the garden, there glided forth the form of a woman clad in white, her hair disheveled, and her face turned away from the spectators. All were filled with terror at the apparition. The ladies fled shrieking to the rear of the palace. The ghost drew nearer and could be distinctly seen, notwithstanding that the moon was now completely hidden by dark clouds. The spirit turned its face and fixed its eyes upon Hideyoshi, who carefully scanned the features and then called out:

"Enough\! Let there be no more of this\!"

"We obey," said the magicians, as they closed the windows. When these were re-opened, the ghost was no longer visible and the moon was once more shining brightly.

The magicians, who had hoped that their skill would win Hideyoshi's approbation, were in great dismay when he ordered them to he cast into prison. In explaining this to the guests, Hideyoshi said:

"These men are not mere sleight-of-hand performers, hut Christians who have hitherto escaped detection. The ghost was that of a woman whom I loved in my younger days and who was executed for poisoning her rival. Though this happened long ago, these men have in some way gained a knowledge of the affair, and they doubtless expected that I would reward them for letting me see again the woman I once loved,"

The two men were found guilty of believing in the barbarian religion, and were crucified.

In the summer of 1615, a great drought prevailed throughout central Japan. All prayers and incantations proving futile, the despairing farmers saw their fields being parched by heat. Hiyan, under the disguise of a Buddhist priest, now returned to the neighborhood of Kyoto. Going to one of the villages, he assured the farmers that he was able to bring the desired rain. In accordance with his directions, a large heap of brush-woodland charcoal was collected and set on fire. Hiyan then jumped into the midst of the flames, moving about among them unscathed as he repeated his incantations.

Meanwhile a report of what was going on had reached the officials in Kyoto, who hastened to the village and arrested Hiyan as he emerged from the fire. On being taken to the city, he was asked to what sect he belonged. He named a temple of which he professed to be a priest; but on making inquiry, it was found that the abbot knew nothing of such a person. He was finally recognised as a Christian by some one who had formerly known him in the Temple of the Southern Barbarians.

A few days later he was led out for execution. Crowds assembled to witness the spectacle. The prisoner had hardly been bound to the cross when he suddenly changed to a rat. Great confusion ensued. The officers tried to catch the creature. "There it is\!" they shouted; "Step on it I There it goes\! Kill it\! Kill it\!"

In the midst of the excitement, an immense hawk came swooping through the air, grasped the rat in its talons, and flew away. The wondering people stood gazing into the sky until the bird vanished in the distance. The officers trembled at the thought that they would be held responsible for the prisoner. When, however, their report had been given, they were told that, though blameworthy for letting him escape, yet, in view of the fact that he had been re-captured, no punishment would be inflicted upon them. All were filled with joy at the Government's clemency.

A strict search was now made for other Christians, Those that were found were sewed up in straw sacks, their heads sticking out like those of tortoises, and thus they were piled in heaps upon the dry bed of the river that flows through Kyoto.

At first the sufferers called out: "We have great reason for thanksgiving. Since we suffer here on earth, we shall be re-born in Paradise. Make haste to put an end to our lives."

After a while one of the officers said to them: "Why do you not recant? You have nothing to hope in the present or the future. We have heard you say that when in trouble you would be nourished with heavenly food; but no one gives you so much as a rice cracknel."

Some near the bottom of the heap, being unable to endure the agony any longer, declared their readiness to renounce Christianity; and these were released. There still remained fifty or sixty, who called out to the others: "Cowards\! Cowards\!"

Those that had recanted replied: "You may say to us what you like. So long as we are free, we do not care, even though in the future world we should be re-born as cats or mice."

The officers now had three hundred horse-loads of fagots brought and heaped on the sand. When the Christians were told that they would be burned, they were in great terror and asked permission to recant. Even at that late hour, they were allowed to go free.

It was commonly reported that these recantations were not genuine. Accordingly strict orders were issued that priests must annually make investigations in their parishes and give to the people certificates that they were not Christians. When any believers in the barbarian religion were discovered, they were burned, crucified, or drowned. Thus the evil was stamped out of the central provinces. In more distant parts of the land, there continued to be those that secretly adhered to the faith of the Southern Barbarians. Those of Arima and Amakusa united in the great Shimabara Revolt that resulted in their utter extermination.

### LOOCHOO 1844-1853



THOUGH missionaries were unable to enter Japan, the Roman Catholic Church could not forget the land where its efforts had once been crowned with so great success, and where so many martyrs had consecrated the soil by their blood. Many were the prayers that the country which had been the scene of such triumphs and such sufferings might again be opened to the heralds of the Cross. There were indications that some knowledge of Christianity yet remained among the people. In 1820, some Japanese came to Batavia for the purpose of purchasing Christian books\*

In 1826, the Christians of Korea, who were likewise obliged to hide themselves from bitter persecution, learned that the Japanese Shogun had requested their King to send back to him six men, believers in Christianity, who had escaped in a boat to Korea.† In 1831, it was found that twenty Japanese sailors wrecked on the Philippines possessed Christian medals that they seemed to regard with superstitious veneration. When asked the meaning of these objects, they could give no satisfactory reply. All they knew about them was that they had been handed down from their ancestors as objects of devotion. After receiving instruction, seventeen of these men asked for baptism.‡

In, 1832, Gregory XVI. established the Apostolic Vicariate of Korea, attaching to it the care of the Loochoo Islands, which it was thought might prove the most important part of the jurisdiction. The Vicar was enjoined to make every effort to reside there rather than in Korea, as it was hoped that the islands could be made the gateway for entering Japan. Mgr. Bruguiere, the first to hold the office, was inclined to think that a better way to accomplish the end in view would be through the Japanese colony that since the time of Hideyoshi had remained at Fusan in southern Korea. His successor, Mgr. Imbert, favoured the same policy, and endeavoured to have a catechist visit the Japanese colonists that he might seek their conversion and learn from them whether anything was left of the ancient church in Japan. As nothing came from this attempt, Mgr. Imbert authorised the agent of the Société des Missions-Etrangères in Macao to send missionaries to Loochoo whenever a good opportunity should come.\*

The Opium War in China \(1840-1842\) opened a new chapter in the history of the Far East. Other nations wished to have a share in the commercial advantages that England was gaining. Admiral Cécille, who was commander of the French fleet in Chinese waters, looked with favour upon the missionaries, not merely because he could use them in carrying out his plans for the extension of French influence, but also from a real interest in their work. He at one time meditated the occupation of some point in the Loochoo Islands, whose position between China and Japan proper made them a suitable place from which to overlook movements in each country. Affairs in China that necessitated his presence caused him to postpone a proposed visit to these islands, Korea, and Japan. In April, 1844, he despatched a corvette under the command of Captain Fornier-Duplan to reconnoitre Loocho. He also requested the Société des Missions-Étrangères to put at his disposal one of its missionaries, who would consent to be left upon the islands in order to study the language so that he might at some future time accompany the Admiral to Japan as interpreter. M. Forcade,† a young missionary who had recently come to Macao, was appointed for this service. He took with him Augustine Ko, a Chinese catechist who, by Admiral Cécille's intervention, had been freed from a prison in Canton, where he had been confined because of his connection with the missionaries.

The corvette reached Napha, April 28, and was at once boarded by six officials. Two of them could speak a very few words of English. The Chinese language proved the least unsatisfactory means for communicating with them. Upon most subjects they were very reticent. When asked whether in talking among themselves they used the Japanese language or one peculiar to Loochoo, they at first pretended not to understand the question and afterwards gave irrelevant answers. They also made no response to the inquiry where their king resided.

In the interviews that were held with the Loochooan officials during the stay of the corvette at Napha they tried to make it appear that their country was too poor and unproductive to make it worth the while for Europeans to come there for trade. Every effort was made to keep the French from visiting the city it being alleged that they would cause great terror to the populace. The officers of the corvette, however, were unwilling to accede to the request that their walks be confined to the seashore. Much to the annoyance of the native officials, they several times pressed forward into the streets of Napha. M. Forcade describes one of the excursions in which he shared. He writes:

"I fell into the hands of a very good police-officer. Hardly had I taken two steps when he offered me his arm, saying:

"'You cannot go there; you cannot go there.'

"'Oh, yes, we can go, ' I replied, and taking his arm started along.

"Every minute and at every turn of the road, my guard would say: You cannot go there, ' to which I invariably replied, 'Oh, yes, we can go. ' For three hours, my arm in his, I led him about in the city and in the fields, through all the streets and along all the paths, while the rain was constantly falling upon us; yet not for a single instant did he lose his patience. Though he kept repeating the same refrain, he all the time treated me with respect and kindness.

Partly to recompense him for his trouble and partly to see what he would do, I tried to make him a present of my umbrella, which he had admired and carried for me. I could not get him to accept it. Desirous, however, of showing in some way how much I appreciated his services, I praised him to an official, apparently his superior, simply saying: 'This is a good fellow and he has taken excellent care of me.' This compliment appeared to embarrass the poor man, for it seems that I had compromised him in the eyes of the other."

Just before going back to the ship, M. Forcade noticed the figure of the cross carved on one of the stones that formed the pavement of the landing-place, He believed that it had been put in that position in order that it might be trodden under foot by every person that disembarked there.

At the first formal interview with the Governor, Captain Fornier-Duplan said that his superior had ordered him to leave at Loochoo the First Imperial Interpreter,\* named Forcade, and another interpreter of lower grade, in order that they might become acquainted with the language of the country. The formal despatch in which the Governor replied to the request for the establishment of friendly relations contained the following postscript:

"The Commandant desires that two interpreters should be left here. We have duly considered this request. Never before have foreigners landed on our shores with the intention of remaining. As the country is unhealthy, we very much fear that if these two men dwell here they may contract some illness caused by the unfavourable climate. We beg you to consider how unfortunate this would be."

Fornier-Duplan therefore wrote to the Governor:

"I am glad that you have not declined to receive the interpreters; for, since my orders are to leave them in your country, I should have been obliged to do so, even if you had sent a refusal; though in that case I should have shared in the chagrin this would have caused you. The observations that you make concerning the climate and your anxiety lest the health of the two men should suffer are proofs of your kindness; but, as you know, whenever Frenchmen receive a command, they obey it, even at the risk of their lives. Hence I shall land these men with their effects to-morrow, and I again ask for them your kind attentions."

In accordance with this message, M. Forcade and Augustine Ko were sent ashore on the morning of May 6. They were taken to Tumai, in the suburbs of Napha, where a Buddhist monastery had been assigned to them for their abode. The corvette sailed away, and M. Forcade was left as the chief actor in a comedy whose ridiculous features he himself could appreciate and vivaciously describe in his letters, though the serious and annoying side of the situation weighed heavily upon his spirit. A large number of officers was installed in the monastery for, the purpose, so it was said, of helping the foreigners pass the time pleasantly. Under the show of guarding them from harm, a sharp watch was kept upon every movement. M. Forcade wrote: "By night as by day we could not blow our noses, expectorate, or cough, without seeing ourselves approached by a dozen persons who, in anxious tones, inquired if we felt ill." The foreigners could not take a step in any direction without being followed by some one. It was with difficulty that they could get out of doors for exercise, and then only to the seashore, where they were surrounded by officers carrying bamboo sticks to drive away any people that happened to be there. They had no reason to complain of the food that was provided, for their table was supplied with the best that the country afforded. Apparently the attempt was made to keep them so well contented that they would not care to go outside the walls of the monastery.

After long negotiations M. Forcade obtained the concession that he could have to himself the chamber in which he slept and the little garden upon which it opened. Despairing of obtaining permission to walk elsewhere than on the beach, he determined to take matters into his own hands. Without paying any attention to the clamour of his attendants, he began to take walks upon the roads near the monastery. One day, however, when he directed his steps towards the city, an officer grasped him and prevented him from going further. On his return to the monastery, M. Forcade sent a letter of remonstrance to the Governor, who replied that the laws forbade foreigners walking anywhere except on the seashore, and that Captain Fornier-Duplan had promised that the persons whom he left behind would carefully obey all laws. M. Forcade answered that in giving this assurance of obedience to the ordinary laws of the country it was not intended that the foreigners should he subjected to special regulations or that they should not enjoy such liberty as the captain had insisted upon having for himself. M. Forcade further said that until it was shown that he was in the wrong he should not change his conduct. As nothing further came from the Governor, he resumed his walks and was subjected to no further annoyance than that which came from being accompanied by a crowd of attendants. He then adopted the policy of varying his pace in accordance with circumstances. The larger his escort and the more they beat the people with their poles, the faster would he walk, much to the discomfort of the officials, who did not enjoy such active exercise. After some time they learned the lesson so well that during the last part of his stay in Loochoo he was allowed to go about with only two officers and one servant.

For a long time little progress was made in the study of the language. At first none of the people about M. Forcade would give him instruction, help him to obtain books, or tell him the names of even the most common objects. Finally, however, one of the officials who had become very friendly, commenced to dictate sentences and otherwise assisted him until he had compiled an extensive vocabulary.

Approach to the people was still denied. One day M, Forcade and Augustine took a longer walk than usual into the country, and their attendants resorted to an expedient that had succeeded on former occasions. They professed to be so tired that they could hardly drag one foot after another. They lagged behind, sitting down every few minutes in the hope that the foreigners would take pity on them and go no further. The latter thought the opportunity too good to be lost. Watching their chance, they turned into a side lane and advanced at a quick pace. The people of the villages through which they passed gave kindly salutations and showed no signs of fear. Finally, M. Forcade sat down beside the road, and as the villagers gathered about him he found that he was able, in a stumbling way, to carry on a conversation with them.

On another occasion when he found opportunity to talk to a peasant, an attendant came up and thought he would prove to the Frenchman what had previously been asserted about the attitude of the people In a tone that implied a demand for an affirmative answer, he asked the countryman: "Is it not true that you farmers are very much alarmed when this person appears in your village?"

"Yes," replied the man, "but it is not because we are afraid of the foreigner. We know that he will do us no harm. The officers and attendants that go with him are the ones that we fear."

From the beginning M. Forcade daily celebrated mass. On the first morning he had hardly uttered the words, *"In nomine Patris,"* when his guards awoke from their slumbers and looked with wonder to see what was being done. Augustine, in accordance with the instructions he had received, said to them in Chinese:

He is praying to his God. Woe to you if you do not keep quiet. Either go out of the room, or else if you remain here, kneel down."

That day they remained, but afterwards they left the room every morning at the time of this service, apparently fearing that some evil influence would be exerted upon them.

Near the beginning of the sojourn in Loochoo, one of the officers propounded such questions as encouraged Augustine to talk to him about the existence of a Creator. As some impression seemed to be made upon the man, it was hoped that he might become an earnest seeker for the truth; but for some reason he was soon removed and the foreigners were unable to learn where he had gone. After this, it was almost impossible for them to have conversation on religious matters with any of the attendants. Every time that Augustine broached the subject, his auditors found some excuse for bringing the interview to an end.

It is said that when the Japanese Government learned that a Frenchman was living in Loochoo it was on the point of taking steps for his arrest and execution, but that the Dutch Resident in Nagasaki interposed and prevented any action from being taken.\*

M. Forcade waited impatiently for the promised coming of Admiral Cécille. Two years passed by and he had not appeared. Meanwhile two or three English vessels had touched at Napha. April 30, 1846, another ship was seen approaching. As it drew near, M. Forcade was again disappointed to see it display an English flag; neither did it lighten the disappointment when he found that the vessel had brought a Protestant missionary, Dr. Bettelheim. Two days later, however, came the *Sabine* of the French navy. As soon as M. Forcade could obtain a boat, he hastened to the ship. Hardly had he reached the deck when his neck was embraced by the arms of some one who exclaimed: "Once your pupil, now I am to be your co-labourer." The person proved to be M. Leturdu, a fellow-missionary who had been sent to reside in Loochoo. The ship brought a budget of letters to M. Forcade. The first one he opened told him that he had been raised to the episcopate and made Vicar Apostolic of Japan and Loochoo.

After a month's stay in Napha, the *Sabine* proceeded to Port Melville, a little farther to the north, where it was soon joined by two other French ships, on one of which was Admiral Cécille. Considerable time was spent in negotiations with the Loochooan officials, and the fleet then set out for Japan, taking with it M. Forcade and Augustine, while M. Leturdu was left in their place. The ships reached Nagasaki July 29, but remained only two days. The French considered that the treatment received from the authorities of the port was very overbearing, and so the Admiral, after protesting against the restrictions that were put upon his movements, sailed away without going on shore.

While M. Forcade was still with the fleet in China, M. Adnet, a priest appointed for work in Japan, arrived from France. He was at once sent to join M. Leturdu, while M. Forcade remained for his episcopal ordination, which took place at Honkong, February 21, 1847.

The French ship that took M. Adnet to Loochoo brought back a favourable report of the treatment received by the missionaries. According to promises made to Admiral Cécille, three persons had been appointed to teach them the language, the monastery where they lived had been repaired, and they enjoyed considerable freedom of movement. Later intelligence, however, showed that, as soon as the ship had sailed away, the old restrictions had been renewed, though the missionaries were allowed to retain their teachers. One of these, who was styled the "chief teacher," was really the chief spy. Apparently his duties were to note carefully the subjects of conversation and to see that the other instructors did not become too intimate with their pupils. When the missionaries went upon the streets, they were accompanied by guards to keep them from having any intercourse with the people. Purchases, however trifling, had to be made through one of the officers.

If the missionaries attempted to speak to any of their guards about Christianity, they were met by the reply: "What you say is very good, but we cannot listen. The Government does not wish us to do so, and we cannot disobey without incurring great danger. There was, however, an old man who had formerly been the head officer of a small island and who now found occasional opportunities to converse with the foreigners. One day, as M. Leturdu was walking on the seashore, the man made a sign for the missionary to follow him to a retired spot, and there asked him:

"Will you not explain to me who Jesus is?"

M. Leturdu replied to the inquiry and then said:

"It is for the purpose of teaching these things that I have come hither. Do you not wish to hear what we have to say?

"Yes, yes; hut it is dangerous. We cannot do so."

"At least, promise me that every day you will use this prayer: 'Lord, help me to know Thee.' Then, as soon as permission can be gained, come and listen to us."

"I will do so," was the reply.

At one time a man seventy years old came from the northern part of the island for the sole purpose, as he said, of seeing the missionaries. He came into the house, but the presence of a servant put a check upon conversation. After he had gone, the missionaries, in considering his manner, thought that he had wished to speak with them on religious matters. Might he not be a descendant of the Japanese Christians, or else some one whose heart God had touched? They hurried out in search of the visitor, who was not to be found and nothing more could be learned about him. Finally, M. Leturdu resolved to go to the northern part of the island, hoping that he could find him there. The officials did their best to keep him from making this journey. When they saw that their remonstrances were of no avail, they sent word to the villagers along the road, ordering them not to furnish the foreigner with food, nor even to talk with him. When he entered a house, all the people seemed to be struck dumb. When he told them that he would not stir until they spoke to him, it usually was not long before they found their tongues sufficiently to answer his inquiries. He was unable, however, to get any trace of the object of his search.

The Governor of Loochoo sent to the Imperial Commissioner in China many complaints regarding the conduct of the missionaries. Admiral Cécille, to whom these complaints were reported, believed that the interests of missions in China, as well as his own honour, made it advisable to promise that MM. Leturdu and Ad-net would soon be removed. When Mgr. Forcade learned of this decision, he was filled with great anxiety. He wrote to the Directors of the Seminary in Paris, urging that they use their influence to have the French Government take the position that the Loochoo Islands were not subject to China and that therefore, the Imperial Commissioner had no right to object to the presence of the missionaries. With, China out of the way, he thought it would be possible for some satisfactory arrangement to be made directly with the Loochooan Government. In any case, it was well to gain time, since, thanks to the English, great changes were taking place in the Far East.

Circumstances led to Mgr. Forcade's being requested to go to France that he might explain certain action that had been taken by a French fleet. He was the more willing to go because he would thus have an opportunity to plead for his Mission. He reached Paris in July, 1847. There he found that the only one of the men at the head of affairs who showed any interest in religious work was M. Guizot. "Though a Protestant, it is he whom I have found most Catholic of them all," was Mgr. Forcade's report to the Pope.

It was decided by the Propaganda that it would be best for Mgr. Forcade to reside in Honkong, which was a better place than Loochoo for watching the course of events, so as to take advantage of any opportunities that might facilitate movements upon Japan. The interests of the Roman Catholic Church in this English colony were put in his care.

M. Adnet, who had been in poor health from the time of his arrival in Loochoo, died July 1, 1848. The Loochooans showed at least the outward signs of sympathy. The Prime Minister and also the Governors of Shui and Napha sent letters of condolence to M. Leturdu. The messengers that brought them asked permission to attend the funeral services. This request was readily granted, but when they further expressed a wish to offer sacrifices at the grave, it took some time to make them understand that this would not be acceptable. "To put an end to the matter," wrote M. Leturdu, "I told them that such an act was forbidden by the law of my country. At this they kept silence and made no more remonstrances. I added that, if the officials desired to honour my associate, they could come to the monastery, where I would offer in their name a sacrifice to the Lord of Heaven for the repose of him whose loss we were mourning; but they did not accept this suggestion."

At the funeral, the three officials with a large train of attendants were present. The procession, preceded by a cross, went to a small graveyard by the seashore, where M. Adnet's body was placed near that of a French surgeon, who had been buried there two years before, A cross, ornamented with other Christian symbols, was erected over the grave, and the missionary's name was inscribed upon a stone.

Before the end of the next month, a French corvette came to Napha. Its captain had been told to take away M. Leturdu. In case the latter was unwilling to go, the officials were to be informed that he remained on his own responsibility. Under these circumstances it seemed inadvisable to insist on staying, and the attempt to reach Japan through Loochoo was for the time abandoned.

When Mgr. Forcade arrived in Hongkong he found there two priests, MM. Thomine-Desmazures and Mahon, who had been assigned to Japan. The former had elaborated a plan for reaching the appointed field of labour. It was to go to Saghalien or to the Kurile Islands, and thence to enter Yezo. Since no foreign ships went to those regions, it would be necessary to hire a Chinese junk and for the missionaries to make all the calculations needed in directing its course. M. Thomine had already written to the Director of the Seminary of Foreign Missions asking that funds be sent for hiring the junk as well as for the purchase of a chronometer, compass, sextants, charts, mathematical tables, and other essentials.

M. Leturdu on coming back from Loochoo was convinced that it was useless to attempt anything further there. He wrote to Paris:

"We were carried thither by war-vessels; we have there an official title—that of Interpreters of the King of France; and we are regarded as French officers sent to spy out the land. Is not all this fitted to increase the opinion which all Japanese have had since the former persecutions that missionaries are only spies and emissaries of the countries from which they come?. . . Because of the opposition of the Government it is impossible, humanly speaking, to make a single convert. Even though the King of Loochoo should come to favour us, he could authorise nothing, since it is not he that governs, but the Emperor of Japan through his envoys."

M. Leturdu desired that another attempt to enter Japan should be made; this time not under the protection of cannon, but trusting only in God and the Virgin. He would have the missionaries approach from the north, conceal themselves among the mountains in some place not likely to be visited by police, and then get into communication with persons in the neighbourhood so as to effect their conversion and utilise them as evangelists. This plan, which was similar to that of M. Thomines, failed to gain the approval of Mgr. Forcade, who wrote in one of his letters:

"I know from a trustworthy source that in less than two years a military expedition will be sent to Japan, and I think it will be prejudicial for us to precede it. We might be regarded as its advance-couriers. It is better to know how to wait. When the ports are opened to foreigners, we can enter them. Even though we should be forbidden to advance into the interior, we could, while waiting for better opportunities, seek the conversion of the Japanese about us."

Mgr. Forcade found conditions in Hongkong so unsatisfactory that he was on the point of going with his missionaries Jo Loochoo, when he met a Japanese who had been shipwrecked a number of years before, and who was now able to converse in English. This man declared that the language used in Loochoo was a corrupt dialect which could not be understood in Japan, This made it seem useless to go again to those islands. The Japanese waif and another who had likewise been shipwrecked were utilised as teachers of the language. The Bishop's ill health made it impossible for him to pursue his studies. M. Mahon, however, was soon busy in preparing a catechism. In January, 1851, the Japanese employed as his teacher was baptised.

In November, 1850, Mgr. Forcade sent a letter to the Prefect of the Propaganda, in which he said he was tired of waiting for the Americans or the English to make any move for opening Japan, and that in the depressing climate of Hongkong he found not only his physical strength impaired, but also his moral and intellectual forces deteriorating. He asked permission to have himself landed on the coast of Japan. There he would attempt no concealment. Wearing his ecclesiastical robes and with the cross suspended from his neck, he would go to the first house that he saw, or, if he found himself near Yedo, would proceed directly to that city. As the Vicar Apostolic of Japan he would demand that he be led into the presence of the Shogun. Though it was improbable that he could gain access to that ruler, he believed that sooner or later he would be brought before some person of high office to whom, both by word of mouth and by written documents, he could present the claims of Christianity, and demand permission to exercise the ministry entrusted to him.

M. Mahon, to whom also this plan was presented, believed that its conception arose from Mgr. Forcade's ill health, and that it would be unwise to make any move upon Japan just before the expected sailing of the American Expedition. The Bishop's health had indeed been seriously impaired and was but little benefited by voyages that he made to Singapore, Manila, and other places. About the close of 1851, he attended a council of the bishops residing in China, and it was largely in the hope that a visit to Europe would facilitate his recovery that the others delegated him to carry a report of their proceedings to the Propaganda. M. Mamas hints that the Jesuits were not wholly disinterested when they favoured this appointment. As their Society had been the first to carry Christianity to Japan, they considered that to them ought to be assigned the duty of resuming a work that there was reason to believe would soon be possible.\* Mgr. Forcade, who decided to sever his connection with the Société des Missions-Étrangères, bestowed on one of the Jesuit Fathers the title of Vicar General, considering that authorisation for such an appointment had been given him by the Propaganda. It was not his intention, however, to give over all authority to the Jesuits, for he also left to M. Mahon the same title.\*

M. Mahon was much perplexed to know what course he ought to pursue. There was much uncertainty about the plans of the Americans; and he did not know whether or not it would be decided at Rome to turn over to the Jesuits the mission that had before been entrusted to the Société des Missions-Étrangères. In 1853, however, M. Colin of the latter Society was chosen as Mgr. Forcade's successor, with the title Prefect Apostolic of Japan. The new appointee died while on the way from Manchuria, where he had been serving as a missionary. He had previously sent letters directing that missionaries be sent once more to Loochoo. We shall see in the next chapter how his plan was carried into effect and how ere long it was possible to enter upon work in Japan itself.

### THE RESURRECTED CHURCH   1855-1867



THOUGH the United States in 1854 negotiated a treaty with Japan, this and the similar arrangements made by other Western nations did not provide for the residence of foreigners in the country. It was, however, evident that the first breach had been made in the barriers that shut the Japanese away from other peoples and that the time could not be far distant when it would be possible for even religious teachers to enter within the walls. In accordance with the plans made by M. Colin, Messieurs Girard, Furet, and Mermet were sent in February, 1855, to Loochoo, which was again chosen as the point from which to watch the progress of events in Japan. No more cordial welcome was given to them than had been received by their predecessors. On the arrival of the French merchantman that conveyed them to Napha, the captain of the ship said to the officials:

"I have on board certain doctors, men of prayer, who are desirous of obtaining information for themselves and of communicating to you the knowledge that they already possess."

On hearing this, the officials used all sorts of excuses and arguments without being able to turn the Frenchmen from their purpose. On the ship were three other missionaries on their way to Shanghai, and one of them has left us an account of the way in which the landing at Napha was accomplished:

"After having offered up the Holy Sacrifice, M. Girard went on shore with the captain. We were to join them by another road with the luggage and to meet all together at the house of the bonzes formerly occupied by our confrères Messrs. Adnet and Leturdu. At mid-day we were on our way reciting the *Vent Creator* and *Memorare.* Some magistrates of the island came to us on our landing. We shook hands with them cordially, and having exchanged gracious salutations with them, we left these mandarins with our two confrères Messrs. Boyer and Mermet, and made our way to the bonzery. On seeing our trunks brought in and put down, the bonzes went out, looking anything but pleased One of the youngest of them asked us in Chinese: 'Why do you come hither?' We answered: 'To stay here and learn the language.' Meanwhile our luggage continued to arrive, and the bonzes with the other authorities present held a conference. One of these priests of error, putting on a long black gown and assuming an air of gravity and severity, came and bade us pack up our trunks and begone. We gave an affirmative nod, but continued to receive and dispose of our luggage."

One of the officials told the foreigners that they must go to see the Regent On reaching the latter's residence at the time appointed, they were told that the Regent was so vexed at their landing that he could not speak to them until two hours later. When they were finally admitted, a statement was read in which the Regent said that, since the people of Loochoo had a religion of their own, they did not need Christianity. If the Frenchmen were allowed to remain, other Europeans would come in such numbers as to cause great trouble to their country, which was so small, poor, and unproductive that it scarcely furnished sufficient food for its present inhabitants.

After the question had been discussed for a while, M. Girard said: "We are brought here by duty. The captain cannot take us on board again. You may be as severe as you please against us; but we cannot go away. You shall kill us rather."

The letter that we have been following says:

"At last the Regent, seeing our firmness and unshaken resolution, and fearing lest the French Admiral should refuse him his assistance against the pirates, permitted Messrs, Furet, Girard, and Mermet to occupy the bonzery on condition that in the course of two or three months they should be fetched away."\*

When Admiral Laguerre heard of this arrangement, he sent orders to the commandants of the vessels under his charge that they should not go to Loochoo for the purpose of taking the missionaries away, but only to see that they were well treated.\*

In May, however, M. Furet was taken on board a vessel of the French navy that was on its way to Nagasaki. Much to his disappointment, he was not allowed to proceed from that port to Hakodate, the commandant expressing his fear that the presence of a missionary on board would prove prejudicial to the interests of France. He was accordingly given passage to Hongkong, where he found M. Mounicou, another missionary assigned to Japan. Under the instruction of a Japanese from Nagasaki, they gave themselves earnestly to the study of the language. The next year both of them were permitted to go on a man-of-war to Hakodate, where they spent four days. They went on shore and took walks into the neighbouring villages, though they were always accompanied by policemen, who hindered their attempts to converse with the people.

In October, 1856, Messrs. Furet and Mounicou went to Loochoo. They found that their associates there had profited but little by the concessions that had been gained for them by the French naval officers. They had, indeed, succeeded in obtaining a house in the middle of the city; but it was soon found that, although guards were not posted on the premises, they were placed on the road that led thither so as to turn back intending visitors. M. Mermet wrote: "It is like living in a desert. This was formerly one of the busiest streets; now it is overgrown with grass and thorns. The houses that once faced ours have turned their backs upon us and have their entrance on the other side. The people are forbidden, under severe penalties, to come near us." Those appointed to teach them the language did their best to mislead and discourage them. Workmen and servants could be engaged only through the officials. Domestic servants were changed every month, and were ordered to talk about nothing that was not immediately connected with their work. Notwithstanding these precautions, one of the servants, a young man twenty-two years of age, listened with interest to what the missionaries said about Christianity and was baptised by them. Soon after this he disappeared and the missionaries believed that he had been put to death.

With various changes in its personnel, the mission in Loochoo was continued until 1862. At times there were individuals for whose conversion hopes were entertained; but with the exception of the young man already mentioned, none went so far as to receive baptism.

M. Mermet's health was so impaired by his devotion to study that it was found advisable for him to remove, in 1857 to Hongkong. The next year he accompanied Baron Gros, who negotiated a treaty between France and Japan, This, which was similar in its provisions to the American treaty that had just been negotiated by Hon. Townsend Harris, permitted French citizens to reside in certain ports.

Unknown to the missionaries, descendants of the ancient Christians of Japan were being subjected to a new persecution the same year that this treaty was arranged. Eighty persons living near Nagasaki were suddenly arrested, and though the majority were at once set free, thirty of them were put in prison. There they endured tortures and privations under which ten of them died, while the health of others who were released in a year or two was so shattered that most of them did not long survive.\*

M. Girard, who had been made the Superior of the Mission, was eager to improve the advantages to be gained through the new treaty. His letters to the Directors of the Seminary in Paris were filled with pleas for men and means. He urged that four missionaries be sent at once so that the ports, as soon as opened, should be provided with priests who could administer the sacraments to the European residents, and also seek out the Japanese Christians who, there was reason to believe, were to be found in different parts of Japan.

M, Girard himself arrived in Yedo, September 6, 1859. A few days later, at the formal ratification of the French treaty, he was present in ecclesiastical dress and was officially recognised as a priest temporarily serving as interpreter for the Consul-General of France. Apparently the fact of his being an ecclesiastic did not excite any prejudice, and the Government graciously furnished three persons to instruct him in the language. A few months later, he commenced to teach French to a number of young officials. Some of their superiors were always present during the lessons, probably to prevent too intimate relations with the pupils and the introduction of dangerous subjects.

In November, 1859, M. Mermet reached Hakodate. His experiences in Loochoo and the knowledge that he had already gained of the Japanese language enabled him to confer directly with the Japanese officials and to set aside the many obstacles that they at first put in his way. The vigour with which he began his labours is shown by a letter that he wrote only eight days after his arrival. In it he said:

"I wish I could tell you of being already settled in my house, which is to cost a hundred dollars; but that cannot be for another week. Every day the house is getting into shape. I spur on the workmen, and cheer them with *sake* at an expense of four hundred cash a week. I am very busy. I am giving lessons in English and French; I help the Consul; I go about among the ships; I measure rafters and beams; I plan out work that Mrs. Hodgson \(wife of the English Consul\] is doing for the adornment of my chapel, which will be very handsome, thanks to the cheapness of silks and embroideries. . . . I have had an audience with three Japanese princes. I have seen and conquered. A fine piece of land has been granted to me temporarily, that is, so long as I remain in Hakodate. This has made all the consuls jealous, since none of them had been able to procure it for even a term of six months."

A month later he had commenced the erection of a chapel. He appeared to have won the good will of all classes of people. He wrote:

"I have visited the principal officers of the city and have been visited by them. On showing them my modest chapel, I said that I had built it for them and for all the Japanese. . . . They have given me all necessary aid for the pursuit of my studies. Everybody knows me and salutes me with respect. Alt the Japanese strive to find some excuse for coming to see me. There are some sick people for whom I am caring, and they do not know how to express sufficiently their gratitude. My little chapel is frequented by Russians as well as by some American and English Catholics. Foreign residents, seeing that I am on such good terms with the authorities, come to visit me. I have opened a school for teaching French."

In March of the next year he wrote:

"Everybody comes to talk with me, even the bonzes, who in the bottom of their hearts hate me and who every week preach against me sermons whose invariable conclusion is: 'May the holy Amida drive out the erroneous doctrine of the Frenchman. this, however, does not prevent them from coming to taste my wine nor from sending me presents of little cakes,"

With all his interruptions, M. Mermet found time for study. He prepared an English-French-Japanese dictionary, and also a phrase-book. Obtaining from the Governor permission to visit a village of Ainu, he made a collection of the words of their language.\*

M. Mounicou removed in 1861 from Loochoo to Yokohama and was entrusted with the work of superintending the construction of a church on land that had already been procured by M. Girard. This building was consecrated January 12, 1862. Though the church was nominally for the use of Europeans, it was hoped that ere long it would be frequented by the people of the country. As soon as it was thrown open to visitors, large numbers of Japanese came to see it. M. Girard wrote February 25:

"During a month our chapel has been visited every day by crowds of Japanese of every class and every rank; men, women, and children, old people, officers, bonzes. There have been a thousand on one day. We joyfully yielded to the pressing solicitations of their praiseworthy and pious curiosity; we explained the meaning of the religious pictures which adorned it, making use of them as an introduction to the more complete instruction of these people in. our holy law; when suddenly there was communicated to us sorrowful news which threw us into consternation. Thirty-three of our listeners were seized coming out from our hounds, chained, and thrown into prison. On the morrow, nevertheless, the visitors continued numerous; the same anxiety was manifested to question, the same respect and docility to hear us. Was what we heard false? Unfortunately, our new hearers soon learned by their own experience that the arrests were too true. Twenty-two of them met the same fate as the former. Immediately the panic spreads in all directions. The news of the persecution is confirmed, and the strangers in the land are everywhere agitated. Our church is deserted."\*

When the French Consul-General conferred with the Governor of Yokohama, the latter said that the Japanese subjects who had been arrested could not escape the penalty for violating the laws of their country. Finally, however, the prisoners were released after the missionaries had given a promise that they would not preach to Japanese until the French and Japanese governments had come to an understanding upon the matter. "We could not preach sooner," wrote M. Girard," and we hope to secure freedom for the prisoners and to remove the odium with which their punishment has loaded us."

The Governor of Yokohama also tried to induce the Consul-General to order that the three Chinese ideographs signifying "Church of the Lord of Heaven" be erased from the front of the building. "Of what advantage," asked he, "is it to write the name of the edifice in Chinese characters which Europeans cannot read? I see in them only a means for tempting the Japanese, and you know very well what are our ideas on this point." The French representative did nothing to comply with this request.

Soon after the consecration of the church, M. Girard left the care of the mission to M. Mounicou during his own temporary absence in China and Europe. He took with him a young Japanese who, on Good Friday, 1863, received at Rome the three sacraments of baptism, confirmation, and the eucharist.

Though the number of missionaries in the open ports was increased in 1863 by the transfer of those formerly stationed in Loochoo, there was little to be done besides caring for the foreign residents, studying the language, teaching classes in French, and waiting for more favourable conditions. In Nagasaki, a church was commenced that was to be dedicated to the Twenty-six Martyrs who, in 1597, had suffered on a hill near the city. Already at Rome, June 6, 1862, Pius IX., in the presence of two hundred and fifty cardinals, patriarchs archbishops, and bishops, summoned from all parts of the earth, had solemnly proclaimed the canonisation of these martyrs. To devout Romanists, the events occurring soon after at Nagasaki "seemed like a visible answer to the honours thus so splendidly rendered to these heroes of the Faith."

The construction of the church went on but slowly and as it neared completion in December, 1864 the builder invented more difficulties than ever. He even threatened to suspend work altogether. Just at this time the Governor asked M. Petitjean, one of the missionaries, who after two years in Loochoo had come in 1862 to Nagasaki, if he would not become the teacher of French in a school that was about to be opened "I should be glad," said the missionary, "to do what is desired; but until I am free from the cares connected with the construction of my building, it will be impossible to assent.

"When," asked the officers, "do you wish that your temple should be finished?"

"By the first of January."

The next morning three times the usual number of carpenters appeared. Work went on by night and day so that the church was completed at the close of the year. The gilded crosses on its three towers glowed in plain sight of all Nagasaki opposite the Sacred Hill \[where the martyrdoms are supposed to have occurred\]. Young and old, men and women, soldiers and citizens came to visit what they called the French Church The boys drew pictures of it with charcoal on the pavements of the public road. The old men repeated to each other stories about ancient Christians and their churches."

The dedication of the church took place February 19, 1865. The European vessels in the harbour were dressed out with flags. The French Consul and the commandant of a French naval vessel came with a guard of honour. The commandants of Russian, English, and Dutch vessels, each accompanied by a dozen Catholic marines, were present. A Russian naval band assisted in the musical part of the service. At noon, salutes were fired by all the men-of-war. To the great disappointment of the missionaries, the people of Nagasaki, usually so curious to see anything out of the usual course of things, appeared indifferent to all this ceremony. Shortly before this, their visits to the church had almost ceased. Evidently the authorities had warned them to keep away.

As we have seen, the missionaries from the first had hoped to find descendants of the early Christians still retaining a knowledge of the faith of their ancestors. Their enquiries, however, brought no intelligence that seemed trustworthy. To M. Fetitjean was given the great joy of learning that their hopes had not been without foundation. The story is best told in his own words:—

"On March 17, 1865, about half past twelve, some fifteen persons were standing at the church door. Urged no doubt by my guardian angel, I went up and opened the door. I had scarce time to say a *Pater* when three women between fifty and sixty years of age knelt down beside me and said in a low voice, placing their hands upon their hearts:

"'The hearts of all of us here do not differ from yours,'

"'Indeed\!' I exclaimed, 'Whence do you come?'

"They named the village, adding: 'All there have the same hearts as we.'

"Blessed be Thou, O my God, for all the happiness which filled my soul\! What a compensation for five years of barren ministry I Scarcely had our dear Japanese opened their hearts to us than they displayed an amount of trustfulness which contrasts strangely with the behaviour of their pagan brethren. I was obliged to answer all their questions and to talk to them of O *Deusu Sama, O Yasu Sama,* and *Santa Maria Sama,* by which names they designated God, Jesus Christ, and the Blessed Virgin, The view of the statue of the Madonna and Child recalled Christmas to them, which they said they had celebrated in the eleventh mouth. They asked me if we were not in the seventeenth day of the Time of Sadness \(Lent\); nor was Saint Joseph unknown \(o them; they call him O *Yasu Sama no Yofu,* ' the adoptive father of our Lord.' In the midst of this volley of questions, footsteps were heard. Immediately all dispersed; but as soon as the newcomers were recognised, all returned laughing at their fright.

They are people of our village, ' they said, ' They have the same hearts as we have.'

"However, we had to separate for fear of awakening the suspicions of the officials, whose visit I feared,"

What follows is a condensation of M. Petitjean's account, omitting some minor details.\*

"Saturday, March 18. From ten o'clock in the morning until night there has been a constant stream of visitors. The Japanese officers, not knowing what to make of this extraordinary concourse, redouble their vigilance, and there does not pass a quarter of an hour without some of them coming into the church. Wanted by what happened in Yokohama, M. Laucaigne and I hold ourselves somewhat aloof About noon, however, I cannot resist the entreaties of a man about seventy-six years old and two women of nearly the same age who ask permission to adore the crucifix. The good old man repeated some prayers in Latin,—*Te Sancte* and others that I was not able to catch perfectly. The entrance of officers interrupted us.

"Sunday, March 19. A crowd like that of yesterday. Some of the Japanese remained in the church even during the mass. Among them I recognised some of our Christians. To four or five who came to adore the crucifix I was able to teach the sign of the cross. They appeared, indeed, never to have made it as we ordinarily do. 'We make it thus,' one of them told me as with his right thumb he signed his forehead and breast.† Then he told me: 'In the village of Urakami not all are like us. There are some spies who watch us; and among those whose hearts are one with ours, there are some who have received but little instruction.'

"Monday, March 20*.* The number of visitors increases. The officers station themselves so as to guard the approaches of the church. In order to protect the interests of these dear souls, who would be compromised by a slight indiscretion or. our part, we abstain as much as possible from appearing in the church. When able to slip in a word, we say to them: 'Return home. The officers are watching you. Come again later and not so many at a time.' 

"Tuesday, March 21. Christians and pagans come in a crowd and mingle together. We recognise the former by their lifting their hands to their breasts when their eyes meet ours. We speak to many of them, telling them not to come again for fifteen days so as not to give alarm to the Government and thus expose themselves to danger.

"Wednesday, March 22. Our Christians have doubtless transmitted our advice to others. They come in smaller numbers. The officers have disappeared or else have laid aside their swords. We are able to speak to some persons and have made an appointment to meet three men to-morrow upon a mountain near the city. We hope to find out about many matters. First, have our people at Urakami always had baptism? If not, we will teach them the formula and get them to administer the rite to infants in danger of death. In the second place, have they preserved the essential mysteries of the Christian faith? In any case, it will be useful to recall these to their minds. Finally, we will learn how they recite their prayers, and teach \(hem where they are ignorant.

"Thursday, March 23. We have returned from our appointment. Only one of the men was on hand, but what he told us is of the highest importance. In spite of persecutions, Urakami has never been without Christians. Baptism has always been administered. Paul, the man who gave us this comforting information, was not able to repeat the words used in the sacrament, for these are known to only a small number of persons. He told us: 'When a child is born, we call the person in the vicinity who knows how to administer baptism. He pours water on the head of the child while making the sign of the cross, gives it a name, and repeats some prayers that we do not know.' He added a number of points that confirm us in the belief that they observe the sabbath and feast days. They are now keeping Lent. Finally, in their prayers they frequently invoke God, the Holy Virgin, their guardian angels, and their patron saints. It was arranged that next Thursday we shall meet the baptiser of Urakami in a house that Europeans frequently visit and whose master is a Christian. It is a small house in the country where visitors go to admire the flowers and dwarf trees. We were there last year without suspecting that we were with a Christian family."

Various causes led to delay in meeting the baptiser. In the first place, the gardener, who had been imprisoned a few years before on suspicion of being a Christian, was afraid that he might again draw attention to himself, He therefore asked that the interview might be held elsewhere. On going to a mountain that was next appointed as the place of meeting, it was found to be occupied with parties of picnickers. Soon after this the baptiser came to the church, where he met M. Laucaigne and made another appointment. The following condensation of M. Petitjean's narrative tells of how this was kept:

Domingo, the baptiser, was surrounded by three or four relatives and friends. He told us that he had greatly longed for this day. for he knew we were their priests. Only the fear of compromising our holy cause had kept him from coming often to the church. But to the important point—the formula employed by him in baptism. Here it is: *'Kono hito wo paotizo in nomne Patero, Hilio, et S'ra Spiritou Sancto, Iamoun.'* The word *ego* is lacking, but in Japanese the pronoun is often understood. The *te* is replaced by *kono hito* meaning *this child, this person.* Before and after the formula are prayers to our Lord and to St. John the Baptist. Is this formula valid? Until a contrary decision has been made, we shall regard it so. At least, we shall keep ourselves from allowing the lightest doubt of it to arise in their minds To make it agree with ours I have told Domingo that the words he employs are the same with a slight difference of pronunciation which the Japanese vocal organs have gradually introduced. He has promised that henceforth he will employ the formula which I have given him in writing and he has repeated over to me. Domingo assures us that he is the only survivor of the last baptisers of the valley. In case of death or disability he will be succeeded by his son, a young man of twenty-five.

"Domingo has given us much precious information concerning the Christian community of which he is the head. Every day there is family worship. On one week the father of the family repeats the prayer aloud; on the following week, the mother; and then the children do it in turn. When any person is at the point of death, his friends gather about him to pray. For eight days after his death, supplications are made to St. Peter to open the gates of paradise for the departed one, who after that is not forgotten in the daily prayers. Domingo recited to us in Japanese the *Salve Regina* and many other prayers. He has put into our hands a unique book of Christian doctrine that he possesses. It has for its title: 'The Commencement of Heaven and Earth' *\(Tenchi no Hajimari no Koto\).* It begins thus: 'The Lord of Heaven, Deus, to whom our adoration is due, is the Ruler of heaven and earth, the Father of men and of all created things.' It was written from memory in 1832 or 1823, We find in it accounts of the Creation, the Fall, the promise of the Messiah, etc. We have found in it some errors, but they are of little importance."

The missionaries soon learned of Christian communities in other places. A young man who came to Nagasaki from the Goto Islands followed a crowd of sightseers to the church. Great was his surprise on seeing the cross and other Christian symbols. Finding an opportunity to speak to the missionaries, he told them that in the island where he lived were a thousand Christians, Only a few days later they were told of fifteen hundred more living among the mountains twenty-five or thirty miles distant. By the eighteenth of June they knew of twenty Christian communities, and were in direct relations with seven baptisers. In boats and on foot companies of believers came to see the church and to ask for crucifixes or medals. Their leaders often spent the night in the house of the missionaries.

The organisation of the communities was nearly the same in all the villages. There were usually two leaders. When possible, the first of these was a man who knew how to read and write. He presided at the prayers on Sunday and came to the beds of the dying. The second was the baptiser. He always had a pupil in training to be his successor. The baptiser did not hold office for longer than ten years; and the pupil, as a rule, studied the formula and assisted in administering the rite for at least five years before succeeding to the office. Sometimes the offices of baptiser and prayer-leader were held by the same person. The Christians had some books and religious emblems that had been handed down from generation to generation. One treatise on "Contrition" had been composed in 1603.

Traces were still to be seen of the distinctions that existed in the work formerly done by the different religious orders. One community often looked upon another as not belonging to the same religion. They used the names Kirishitan sect, Bateren sect,\* and Dogio sect according as the original teachers had been Franciscans, Jesuits, or Dominicans. Saints honoured in one village might be unknown in another, and there were differences in the days observed for fasting.

Among the prayer-leaders that visited the church was a fisherman named Michael, who came from an island near Nagasaki. At the end of the interview, the mis«manes gave him a discipline with which to scourge himself when imploring pardon for his sins. His zeal in its use soon led to his being known by the name Michael of the Discipline." He offered to put his boat at the disposal of the missionaries and take them to his own or other islands for secret interviews with the Christians. In September, M. Petitjean thought that he might venture to accept this invitation. His account of the trip, with some abbreviation, is as follows:-

"At evening Michael came to the house at the appointed hour to conduct me, disguised as a Japanese, to his boat, which was waiting for us near the station of the harbour police. The night was so dark that I did not need the disguise. Wearing my cassock, 1 went to the shore with my guide. We set out at eight o'clock in the evening and by half past eleven had reached our destination. On arriving at the hut which was to be my hiding-place, I found there more than thirty persons. It was a meeting of the leading men of the place, who for a long time had been urging me to visit them. The remainder of the night and all of the next day were spent in religious conversation. People were constantly coming and going. The village numbers at least three hundred houses, in each of which live six or seven people There is not one of them who has not been baptised. The general spirit of this Christian community is excellent. It is surprising to find among them so much knowledge of our Faith The doctrines of the Holy Trinity, of the Fall, of the Incarnation, and of the Redemption, seem to be as familiar to them as to most of our French Catholics, They know and keep the Commandments. They lead a life of penitence and perform frequent acts of contrition, especially at the hour of death. There are no books in their village; yet most of the inhabitants know by heart the-Lord's Prayer the Angelic Salutation, the Apostles' Creed, the *Confiteor,* the *Salve Regina,* and the Act of Contrition Many of them repeat the treatise on Contrition of which I have before spoken In the house whose hospitality I received they showed me with much reverence an image representing the Fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary, and below it were represented St. Francis of Assisi, St. Anthony of Padua, and a third saint whose name I could not tell. I have learned from the leaders of the community that in their village and a number of others the ceremony of trampling on the cross had not been practised from time immemorial. This exemption was due to the feudal lords, who were willing to show their independence of the Court at Yedo The same persons tell me that at the time when the ceremony was in vogue the Christian officers used frequently to substitute images of Shaka for those of Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin."

As the officials in Nagasaki sent warnings to the people that they ought not to visit the foreign church, it was arranged that the prayer-leaders and baptisers should come to the residence of the missionaries once a month, by night, in order to receive instruction, which afterwards they should convey to the other believers. These visitors were required to give a password when they came to the garden-gate. The servants employed by the missionaries then admitted them to their own apartments as though they were personal friends, and then saw that all the gates were securely fastened so that there might be no danger of interruption.

In the last months of 1865, notwithstanding the commands given by the officials, many deputations of Christians came to the church, among them being several from the Goto Islands. M. Girard in sending to Paris for more missionaries said that in the communities known to be in the southwest of Japan the Christians were estimated at fifty thousand. M. Petitjean at about the same time put the number of those in and around Nagasaki at twenty thousand; but in 1868, he informed the United States Minister that, so nearly as could be estimated, the number in the whole empire was about twenty thousand. In 1892, the Vicar Apostolic of Southern Japan said that, in all, fifty thousand descendants of the ancient Christians were discovered, though only about one-half of them re-entered the church, the remainder—"the rich," as he put it,—refusing to do so.

As the missionaries became better acquainted with the conditions of the different communities, they were much perplexed over the difficult problems awaiting solution. The Roman Catholic Church places so much stress upon baptism that there was much anxiety concerning the validity of the rite as it had been administered, The formulas used by different baptisers were found to be more or less corrupted.\* In some cases the water had been applied without pronouncing the words: in others, the formula had been pronounced upon the water, which was then sent by a messenger, who sometimes poured it on the head of the child and sometimes made him drink it.

Difficult, too, were the questions connected with marriage; for the Christians, deprived of their teachers, had fallen into the ways of the people about them. It was estimated that one-fourth of the families were in an irregular condition, because of divorces; while the unwillingness to contract marriages with unbelievers had increased the number of those within the prohibited degrees of relationship.

It was thought that no time ought to be lost before beginning to prepare men to be teachers of these companies of Christians. The missionaries fitted up in their own house a room that they named "The Hall of the Immaculate Conception." This was used as the abode, or rather hiding-place, of boys and young men, who received instruction in Christian doctrine, and to some extent, in Latin, It also served as a retreat for visitors who needed to spend more than a single evening at the Mission.

Messrs. Petitjean and Laucaigne felt the necessity of having a catechism to be used by the leaders of the Christian communities. They thought it best to keep the terms that were already current among the Christians. Meanwhile, Messrs. Girard and Mounicou in Yokohama, were preparing a catechism in which these terms—half Portuguese, half Latin—were replaced by those used in China. The difference of opinion over this matter caused some friction. The Yokohama catechism was the first to be completed, but when copies of it were sent to M. Petitjean, he would not distribute them. M. Libois in China, made this difficulty an argument for urging the officers of the Seminary in Paris to try and obtain the making of speedy arrangements for the governing of the Mission. It was partly in consequence of this that, in 1866, M. Petitjean was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Japan.

On the feast of the Twenty-six Martyrs in February, 1866, the sacrament of the Eucharist was for the first time administered to the Japanese. The service was held in the secret Hall of the Immaculate Conception where, on the previous night, "conditional baptism" had been administered to the intending communicants, in order to set aside any question about the validity of that which had been received before. These communicants were three young men who desired to devote their lives to the service of their Church. The missionaries would gladly have sent them for study to the seminary in China; but at that time it was difficult for a Japanese to leave his country. In the vicinity of Nagasaki there was a strict registration of all the inhabitants, with a yearly inspection by the police to see that none were absent without due authorisation.

Other first communions soon followed. A regular organisation of the catechumens was made so that they should come for instruction at appointed times and in companies of not more than twelve or fifteen at once. Those that were taught became teachers in their turn, as they returned to the villages and communicated to others what they had been told. Especially in Urakami there was great zeal to receive instruction. It was soon said that every one there, from the children six years of age to the old men and women, knew the prayers and more or less of the catechism. Tomokichi, who was now the baptiser, had so many asking for instruction that he felt obliged to limit the numbers, and so he refused to teach the girls. Thereupon, several of them, aged fifteen to eighteen, came as a deputation to remonstrate.

"Have you received religious instruction in order to teach everybody except us? Do you not wish that our souls should be saved? If we die, what will become of us?"

As Tomokichi remained inflexible, they became more importunate and said:

Wretch that you are, do you wish then to keep everything for yourself? Do you despise us because we are women? Have we not as much need as others for salvation? We have fully decided that we will remain unmarried in order that we may give ourselves body and soul, to God."

They withdrew in tears, many of them resolving that they would learn to read in order that they might make use of the catechism. Copies of this, made in the Hall of the Immaculate Conception, were in circulation among the Christians. When the missionaries learned what had occurred, they advised Tomokichi to teach the girls provided they came accompanied by some of the mothers and at a time when young men were not present. Afterwards he might choose one or two widows for special instruction, who should serve as catechists for the women.

The Christians manifested great solicitude for the souls of their ancestors. To one who came, asking if it would not be possible to obtain paradise for those that had died before hearing the Gospel, M. Petitjean said: But your progenitors for several generations have been Christians." "Yes, for seven generations; but before that all were pagans." The missionary told him that he should confine his prayers to those of his relatives who, according to Roman Catholic theology, might be in purgatory.

In 1866, M. Furet came to Nagasaki, and the Mission was increased by four new missionaries. M. Petitjean was absent through part of the year, having gone to Hongkong for episcopal ordination. On his return he spent a few days in Tokyo, where he told M. Roches, the French Minister, of his fears that the believers might be persecuted, and received the assurance: "I give my word that in case your Christians are disturbed they may count upon the French Minister."

M. Furet considered that M. Petitjean was altogether too timid in trying to prevent the Christians from flocking to the church in such numbers as would arouse the opposition of the Government; but it was not long before events showed the need for caution. In November the head officer of Urakami assembled the chiefs of the villages, together with some of the principal Christians, and addressed them as follows:

"I supposed that after the misfortunes coming upon you ten years ago you had ceased to be Christians. On the contrary, I know that you often go to the European priests. I know that for a year you have been going to them for instruction, that your children are employed as their servants, and that you have carried many plants to ornament the grounds about the church. I wished to warn you earlier, but was prevented by illness. Believe me, you are doing wrong. Cease from such acts if you do not wish to be severely punished. I say this to you, who are the principal men of our village, so that you may prevail on your people not to provoke the Governor's anger by continuing to frequent the church."

All listened in silence to this exhortation and departed without making any reply. The visits by day to the church became infrequent; but every night many men came to the residence of the missionaries to receive instruction and prepare for the communion.

In January, 1867, M. Laucaigne began to make visits to the Urakami valley, remaining several days at a time in the retreats that the people prepared for him in the different hamlets. He himself has given to us some details of the methods that he used:—

"When nearly every one had gone to bed and there were but few people in the streets, I would lay aside the cassock that I usually wore and put on a Japanese dress that our Christians had made for me, a wig that was a gift from one of them, and some straw sandals, which, if it were muddy, served for but a single trip. The girdle about the waist and a kerchief around the head completed my costume. In this disguise I went among the Christians accompanied by two young men who carried a lantern and what I needed for saying mass. When I reached the Christian quarters, I was sure of meeting a company of the faithful who came out in front of their houses or walked along the fields on the edge of the road that they knew I would take. As soon as I came near them, they would kneel and make the sign of the cross; it was their way of saluting and of asking the blessing of their spiritual father. The Christians prepared for my reception little hiding-places in the most retired parts of their houses. Sometimes the little altar before which I was to say mass would be set up in a barn that on the outside had all the appearance of a shepherd's hut. It was always in the middle of the night that I said mass; all was over by dawn. Those that had been in attendance returned at once to their homes; there remained with me only so many persons as I could hear confess during the day it goes without saying that I took good care not to go out by day lest I should be recognised by the heathen. It was only by night that I went to visit the sick or changed my residence I remained but little more than a week consecutively in one place. Those were the happiest moments of my life,"

M. Cousin, a new missionary who had arrived the previous year, spent eleven days in the Goto Islands, where he administered baptisms and communions. By the first of March those in the islands and in Urakami who had been admitted to the Eucharist numbered about four hundred.

Many among the Christians showed much zeal in carrying to others the instruction that they had received. Michael of the Discipline used to set out in his boat every day, as though to engage in fishing, but in reality to visit the Christians. Though not possessed of much education, he had so thoroughly learned the catechism and some of the prayers that he could teach them to others. After a while he began hunting up believers in more distant places, as in Hirado, where there were said to be about a thousand Christian families.

As believers in remote communities learned of the presence of missionaries in Nagasaki, many of them came for instruction. Since the Hall of the Immaculate Conception could give shelter to only about twenty persons each night, others had to await their turn. The Urakami people, although most of them were poor, gladly offered hospitality to their fellow-believers. One of the leading Christians sometimes had more than twenty of these visitors lodging with him. Another was zealous in hunting up any Christian travellers who were ill. Often he would carry such on his shoulders to his house, which was thus transformed into a hospital. If any of these persons seemed in danger of death, M. Laucaigne was summoned to their side.

### PERSECUTION   1867-1873



IT had been the custom of the Christians to avoid trouble by joining with others in making contributions to the temples, and by allowing deceased friends to be buried with Buddhist rites. Those in Urakami now resolved that, whatever might be the consequences, they would make no more gifts to temples. In April, 1867, the relatives of a Christian who had died asked the missionaries what they ought to do about the funeral. The latter said that the Church, as the enemy of all superstition, disapproved of heathen ceremonies, and they advised that, without having recourse to the Buddhists, they give notice of the death to the officers of the village. Instead of following this advice, the relatives, as had been done in some other cases, buried the body without saying anything to either officers or priests. These last brought the matter to the attention of the Mayor, who summoned the brother of the deceased person, reproved him for what he had done, and threatened to make him exhume the body in order to have it properly buried by the bonzes. The Christians made no reply, and the menace was not carried into effect. A few days later another death occurred. In this case notice was sent to the Mayor, who gave an order for burial by a Buddhist priest. The relatives declared that they would not accept the priest's services, and the Christians of the different villages sent deputies to the Mayor saying that, while they were loyal subjects of the Government, they wished to have no dealings with the bonzes. A few days later, the son and another relative of the deceased person were summoned to appear before a magistrate in Nagasaki. By advice of their Mayor they asked the deputies of the villages to go with them. At two o'clock on the morning of the appointed day, they sought strength through the sacrament of the Eucharist, and afterwards went to the magistrate. He said to the son:

"You have buried your mother without notifying the Mayor or the priest."

"I informed the Mayor but not the priest."

"Why did you not call the latter? You know the law."

From this point Dominic Zenemon, one of the deputies, took the place of the son in replying to the magistrate. In response to the last question he said:

"We do not like the bonzes, and our aversion to them we have received from our ancestors."

"Why do you dislike the bonzes?"

"We do not believe what they teach."

"Henceforth, you must conform to the customs of the country and call them."

"We are citizens of this country and are disposed to obey you in ail respects. Our religion declares this to be our duty. We cannot, however, call the bonzes, for that would be contrary to our religion. You can command us in whatever relates to the body; but not in what concerns the *anima."*

"What do you mean by that word *anima?"*

"The *anima* is the soul. It is that part of ourselves that does not die, that is capable of doing good or evil, and that, after life in this world is over, will receive reward or punishment."

"What is this religion of yours?"

"It is that which we received from our ancestors, It gives peace to our hearts in this life, and assures us of perfect blessedness in the life to come."

As the magistrate made further inquiries concerning their belief, Dominic said:

"Being but a poor farmer, I know only the most essential parts of the doctrine; but if you will go to the French priests, they will tell you all about our religion."

The Governor also met the deputies, and after asking a few questions dismissed them. The next day he sent them his decision that they ought to call the bonzes to conduct funerals. The Mayor advised them to present a petition asking to be freed from the necessity of doing what was opposed to their beliefs. Of eight hundred families living in the Urakami Valley, seven hundred were included in the list of those asking this exemption. Four days later, there was another death, and to the surprise of the people the Governor then gave his authorisation for funerals to be held without recourse to the Buddhists. The police officers simply took note of the failure to have the customary rites performed, and said that the course to be pursued would be decided later. In other respects the Christians for a while enjoyed greater freedom. They went openly to the church in Nagasaki, and made no attempt to conceal the chapels in Urakami. The change in the attitude of the officials was probably owing to the unwillingness of the Shogun to have anything done that would offend the French Minister, whose support he hoped to gain against those who were trying to overthrow his power. The Minister himself, when visiting Nagasaki in May, had met the Christians who were concealed in the house of the missionaries, and had promised to use his influence in their behalf. He also took part in the service of dedicating an image of the Virgin Mary that was set up before the church. In the evening the front of the church was illuminated, and the Vice-Governor, in company with the French Consul, came before the image and presented his congratulations to Mgr. Petitjean.

This apparently favourable condition of affairs was but the calm preceding the outbreak of a storm. About three o'clock on the morning of July 15, M. Laucaigne, who was spending a few days in Urakami, was suddenly awakened by the master of the house where he was stopping, who called to him:

"They are coming to arrest us. Quick\! We must flee."

M. Laucaigne hastily dressed and barely escaped from one side of the garden as armed men entered at the other. The rain was falling in torrents as he made his way to the cabin of a poor old woman who lived on the edge of a forest. He had been there but a few moments when the approach of a band of officers made it necessary to flee. Hastening through the forest he came to a deep and thickly wooded valley where he remained several hours. When all seemed quiet he returned to the cabin Another alarm drove him back to the forest, where he spent the night and then made his way to Nagasaki.

The police had been conducted to the village by a traitor, a young man who a few months before had made his first communion, and who on account of some family quarrel had put himself at the service of the Mayor, that officer being no longer inclined to favour the Christians, the chapel that had been M. Laucaigne's retreat was pillaged and all of his effects that he had left behind were taken. Several of the villages in the valley were visited and a number of the people arrested. The prisoners were at first taken before the Mayor. A crowd of their friends followed them. It is said that the Mayor tried to stir up the people to resist the officers and even to use weapons, his object being to have them raise such a revolt as would in the eyes of foreigners be a sufficient reason for punishment. Some of the Christians were so indignant at the cruel way in which the prisoners were treated that they did come to blows with the officers but there was no such general disturbance as the Mayor desired.

Sixty-four of the arrested persons, some of them being women, were taken to Nagasaki. Crowds watched them as they passed through the streets. The European residents were greatly stirred by the sight. The consuls of different countries uttered their protests. In an interview with the Governors, the French Consul said:

It is not in the name of the Frences that I come before you; it is as a friend and in the name of humanity whose laws you violate. Europe will condemn your act In her esteem you will descend to the rank of barbarous peoples, and your relations with her will suffer. It may even be that the foreign ministers residing in Yedo will oblige you to retrace your steps, a humiliation that can be avoided if you now of your own accord release the prisoners."

A few days after the arrest General Van Valkenburgh, the American Minister, came to Nagasaki, In a report to his government, he wrote:

"I at once asked an audience with the two Governors of Nagasaki, and on the twenty-ninth of July they visited me pursuant to my request. I expressed to them my regret at the occurrence and endeavoured to induce them to release the poor prisoners. They declined, having arrested them as criminals under the laws of Japan upon complaint and proof, unless by direction from the Government. They assured me, however, that they had not been tortured, and promised that the wants of those confined, as well as their families, should be provided for, and that no future arrests should be made until directions were received from the Goroju \(Shogun's Council\)."

The missionaries were much disappointed by the attitude of the French Minister. In a letter written August 8, to Mgr. Petitjean, he said that he had hastened to confer with the Shogun's Council, and had been impressed with the sentiments of moderation and tolerance expressed by its members. He was told that orders would soon be sent to Nagasaki for setting the prisoners at liberty. Meanwhile he reminded the missionaries that the present moment, when the enemies of the Shogun were watching every opportunity to weaken his authority, was not a favourable time for seeking a definite settlement of the religious question, on which the Japanese felt so deeply. He added that he did not doubt the missionaries would use their influence with the Christians to induce them to observe certain external formalities that did not touch their religious beliefs.

Evidently the "external formalities" of which the minister wrote were those connected with funerals, and the missionaries were unwilling to withdraw from their decision that the Christians ought to have nothing to do with the Buddhist priests. Two more deaths had occurred, and those responsible for the funerals had been taken into custody. To the protest of the American Minister that this was a violation of the promise made to him that there should be no more arrests until orders came from Yedo, the reply was given that the persons in question had not been put in prison, but were simply held for examination.

Persecution now commenced in the villages of Omura, some twenty miles from Nagasaki. In connection with a registration of the inhabitants, they were ordered to seal with their own blood, a statement that they were not Christians, and also to drink water over which the Buddhist priests had pronounced certain formulas. In one village forty men who refused to obey were thrown into prison, the women and children being left at liberty. In another village, the Christians at first sealed the document; but when they realised its meaning, they declared that they had been deceived and that they wished to be known as Christians. Thereupon, seven of the men were taken into custody. When the believers in Urakami learned what had happened, some of their number went to these villages in order to guard the houses and otherwise help the women and children, who, however, were soon after imprisoned as their husbands and fathers had been. The whole number of arrests at this time in Omura was about one hundred and ten.

A few days later an attempt was made to procure a general apostasy in Urakami. The Christians of the different villages were told to send delegates to receive an official communication. They accordingly chose persons for this purpose; but the Mayor, who feared that those selected might be too immovable, replaced them by others. On the appointed day the Governor of Nagasaki met these people. He urged them to take such action as would secure the release of their friends and put an end to the trouble. The first two delegates to whom he appealed were frightened into promising to do what was required. The next seven would not yield. Disconcerted by their firmness, the Governor told them to put their statements into writing so as to send them to him in a few days. He then said it was necessary for him to return to Nagasaki where the prisoners were being examined. His place was now taken by a subordinate, before whom came the delegates that had been originally chosen by the villagers. They bore a petition that they asked him to present to the Governor. After he had examined it, the officer said:

"This of itself is sufficient to ruin you, for in it you have used the word 'Christian,' a name which the Government does not permit."

Throughout the interview the officials themselves had always taken care not to use that word, hut had replaced it by such terms as "the French religion," "the foreign religion," "the religion of the Lord of Heaven," etc.

On the same day in Nagasaki, five of the Christians were led in chains across the city from the prison to the place where they were to be examined. They were taken one at a time before the Governor, who among other questions, asked them how they had been instructed, who were their leaders, who among them had taken the first steps in getting the missionaries to visit their villages, and whether they were able to perform miracles.

These examinations were continued from day to day. On September 8, when twenty-two of the prisoners were brought before the officers, all but one of them apostatised. At their head was the chief of one of the villages, a man enfeebled by ill health, who was as yet only a catechumen. The apostates did not receive their liberty, though they were exempted from the severe treatment to which the others were now subjected. The latter were crowded into a little room and had their food reduced to a very small allowance.

At this time, for reasons not connected with the Christians, the Governors of Nagasaki were replaced by an envoy of the Shogun. In an interview with the French Consul the new official denied that the prisoners had been ill-treated. He said that he would release them if they would renounce their faith. Henceforth, too, the missionaries must cease to visit them. When the Consul asked why the prisoners had not already been set free in accordance with the promise made to the French Minister, he was told that the Shogun had never ratified the action of the Council in this matter.

One concession was granted a little later. Whereas, forty-seven persons had been confined in a room twelve feet long and six feet wide, the number was now reduced to thirty-three.\*

On September 16, twenty-eight of the Christians in Urakami were called to the house of the Mayor, that they might be questioned separately by the Buddhist priests.

Why, was the question put to one of them, "do you follow the religion of the foreign priests? Cannot you save your soul well enough through Buddhism, which likewise teaches about heaven and hell? We also adore one supreme being—Amida. It is only because you are not acquainted with our teaching that you reject it."

"No," was the reply, "it is because we are Christians and wish nothing to do with Amida."

"But what you believe is really the same as what we hold to be true. Tell me what your belief is."

The Christian repeated the Apostles' Creed, strongly emphasising the article, "I believe in the life everlasting" That is a very beautiful doctrine. You can follow it without calling yourselves Christians and thus doing what is forbidden by the laws of the land. Do not the commands of the Lord of Heaven require obedience to parents? Why then do you disobey the rulers, who are the fathers and mothers of the people?"

"We are quite willing to obey the rulers, but not to accept the doctrine of Amida," persisted the Christian.

Soon after this Mgr. Petitjean received from M. Roches, the French Minister, a note that contained the following passage:

"You will to-day receive an official letter, an authentic copy of which I have transmitted to the Japanese Government. It is only in consequence of receiving this document that it has consented to set the prisoners at liberty without demanding from them any act that could be regarded as an abjuration. I ought to add that it was not without great difficulty that I secured this solution. of the problem. The daimyos, who, we have been told, are little favourable to the spread of Christianity, and who are perfectly well informed concerning all that has occurred at Nagasaki, have all sent protests to the Shogun against the present state of affairs. They expressed the opinion that the Shogun's Government had given tacit assent to their views, and they added that they were determined to resort to the most energetic methods for causing the fundamental laws of Japan to be respected. They declared that they had given stringent orders for the beheading of any European priest or Japanese Christian that might dare to enter their territories. These letters of the daimyos are by no means a pretext invented by the Japanese Government to cover the present necessity; I have read them and have been able to verify for myself their authority."

The official letter to which the personal note refers was likewise addressed to Mgr. Petitjean. It informed him that the Japanese Government had consented to pardon the persons arrested at Nagasaki who had violated the laws of the country by professing an unauthorised religion. "I ought to add," continued the Minister, "that, if the Shogun forgives the past, he understands that in the future the Japanese will observe the laws of the Empire. I therefore hope that as regards your Catholic Mission you will avoid every act that has for its purpose the encouragement of Japanese subjects who profess the Christian religion in continuing their resistance to the authorities under whom the laws of Japan place them."

The Minister also wrote to the French Consul in Nagasaki:

"After I have obtained the unconditional release of all the Japanese who have been imprisoned on the charge of having violated the laws of the country by professing the Christian religion, you will warn the Bishop in my name that he must henceforth avoid everything that can encourage Japanese subjects to break or defy the laws of the land. Hereafter no priest of the Catholic Mission should go to Urakami or elsewhere for the purpose of religious propagandism. In the great state of excitement that now prevails in the south of Japan, the presence of a Catholic missionary in the midst of the native population would be the cause of incalculable evils. A sound policy and the true interests of our religion admonish us to do all we can to avoid such a result. You will therefore aid, so far as you can, the carrying out what is written in this letter and the spirit of my instructions."

It is not strange that Mgr. Petitjean felt called upon to write to the Minister reminding him that he had been kept informed of what was happening, and that during his visit to Nagasaki, in June, when his attention had been called to the question of the funerals, he had tried to reassure the missionaries by speaking of the liberal ideas of the Shogun, while at the same time he had promised the Christians that he would use his influence in favour of religious toleration. The letter closed with the statement that it would be impossible to follow the recommendations made by the Minister.

The prisoners were brought, October 5, before the Governor, who informed them that they could be set at liberty only on condition of their signing a document which admitted that they had been following a religion not sanctioned by the Government. Some of them consented, and after three days ten of the leaders of the Christians, who had been subjected to torture, yielded, and said to their companions:

"We have submitted; and if we, who are men, have done so, what can you women and children do? It is impossible for you to hold out. It is better to surrender at once rather than to suffer torture uselessly."

This advice was so far followed that the paper was signed by all of the prisoners with the exception of Dominic Zenemon, who still stood firm. Twice was he tortured; but each time he came forth victorious from the test. No less than seven times was he brought before the Governor or his delegates.

"How have you been instructed?" he was asked.

"At first I went like the others to visit the church. There, I saw the priest praying and I asked him to teach me his doctrine."

"Were you not aware that the laws of Japan forbid its people to follow the religion of foreigners?"

"I did know it; but I thought the Emperor ought to permit us to follow this religion, for its doctrines are good, and it teaches nothing but what is right. Urakami has become much better since it has learned the Christian doctrines. Its people do not quarrel, nor drink; they busy themselves with taking care of the sick or with labour in the fields, which are more productive than ever before. It is asserted that Christians practice sorcery and perform miracles. This is a mistake. Sorcery is the work of devils; and if we could work miracles, we should have come out of the prison in spite of you."

"This religion may be good; but by following it you have broken the law and so done wrong."

"No, I have not done wrong; for God, who teaches men this religion, is my first Father and my first Mother. As for the law, if I have violated it, let the offence be washed out by my blood. I give up my body to satisfy the law; but I wish to save my soul."

Notwithstanding his steadfastness, Dominic was soon set at liberty. On his return to Urakami his house was crowded with those that came to hear from his own lips the story of the trials through which he had passed. Those who had not been so brave were ashamed of their weakness. Already, on the day of their deliverance from prison, thirty-eight persons had gone to the Governor's house, saying: "Our apostasy was only in words and not from the heart. We were overcome by fear of torture. To atone for our crime we are ready to go back to our chains, to suffer, and to die." A few days later, ten others wished to follow their example; but the official of their district refused to bring them before the Governor.

Officers had been sent to destroy all the chapels in the valley, and they compelled the Christians to assist in the work. Fifty policemen were stationed in the villages to watch over those who had withdrawn their acknowledgement of wrong-doing. At first these persons were not allowed to have any communication with others. While they were at home, guards stood before their doors; and when they went to work in the fields, they were followed by officers. Little by little this surveillance was relaxed, and in December the guards were withdrawn. A few days before this was done, the Governor himself came to the houses of those that had retracted, expressed his pity for what they had suffered, and in a paternal way advised them to be more careful in the future. He feigned ignorance of their protestations that they had never wished to renounce Christianity, and said that he was so satisfied with their submission to the Government that he could now take away the guards as being no longer needed. A patrol was kept in the village, however; daily visits being made to the houses of the persons who had retracted. The object of this seemed to be to prevent them from having any communication with the missionaries; yet hardly a night passed when some of them did not find means of going to the residence in Nagasaki where they expressed great remorse for the weakness they had shown, and sought pardon for their sin.

Death could not be shut out from the valley; and those that were responsible for the burial of their friends without Buddhist rites were summoned before the officials, only to be dismissed with a reprimand or with the statement that their cases would be considered later.

The prisoners in Omura suffered much from insufficient food and, as winter came on. from insufficient clothing. Four adults and several children died.

There was persecution in other communities. Some of the Christians apostatised, while others tried to conceal their faith. Even Michael of the Discipline advised the Christians to assume the outward appearance of heathenism. When the missionaries learned of this, they were able to get him to come and see them, and as a result of the interview he put away certain Buddhist emblems that he had thought it right to use in order to avoid persecution. At Shittsu a number of Christians were beaten because they refused to attend Buddhist services Afterwards ninety persons from this place and seventeen from Kurosaki, were sent to the coal mines at Takashima as convicts, sentenced to hard labour.

Though the Christians in the Goto Islands were not molested at this time, they were apprehensive that their turn would come. Six of their number, therefore set out in a small boat to see if they could not find some uninhabited island that would serve as a retreat for the Christians when persecution should arise. For several months nothing was heard from them. Driven about by the winds and disappointed by finding people living in all places at which they touched, they finally came to a small island belonging to Satsuma. Its inhabitants regarded them as shipwrecked sailors, confiscated their boat, and sent them to Nagasaki, whence they returned to their home, convinced that no island suited to their purpose could be found.

In October, 1867, Mgr. Petitjean went to France and Rome in order to plead the cause of his Mission. His attempts to induce Napoleon III. to make a benevolent intervention in favour of the persecuted Christians were of no avail, the Emperor saying that nothing could be done except in concert with the other Powers.

It was in the absence of the Vicar Apostolic, who did not return until June, 1868, that the Shogunate was overthrown and the old edicts against Christianity re-affirmed by the new Government. Even before this last action was announced, there were signs of the storm that was soon to break in its fury. March 16. twenty-two Christians of Urakami, eleven of whom had been among those arrested the previous year, were ordered to appear before the new Governor. One of them was Dominic Zenemon, who became their spokesman. About three hundred of their friends followed them to the open courtyard in front of the Governor's residence. While waiting for the door to be opened, they knelt upon the coarse pebbles that took the place of a pavement, and with rosaries in their hands, spent the time in prayer.

The officer that conducted the examination began by asking:

"Is it true that you adore Jesus and follow the religion of the French?"

His pronunciation of the word "Jesus" being different from that used by the Christians, Dominic was not quite sure of its meaning and so said:

"We follow the true Christianity."

"Christianity \[Roman Catholicism\] is the religion of the French, If it were good, the other nations of Europe would accept it. Instead of doing so, they mock at it Therefore, it is evil and you ought to give it up."

"We cannot do so. It is necessary to be a Christian in order to secure the salvation of the soul in another life."

"Do you believe that a naked man, a criminal fastened to a cross, can protect you? Ten years ago some of your people were put in prison and many of them have since died. Do you believe that any calamity has come to the officers that ordered their punishment?"

"God does not always punish men in this life. He waits."

Dominic was going on to explain some of the Christian doctrines when he was ordered to be silent:

"Who are you that you dare to talk in this way before your superiors? You must give up this religion or else resign yourself to death. Choose."

"I cannot give up being a Christian."

"Are you all of the same mind?"

"Yes, yes," cried the Christians, as they made low bows.

The question was put to them three times with short intervals for reflection; but they continued to give the same reply. The officer then said:

"You have come here with closed ears, fully determined not to listen. What would happen in your families if the women and children refused to obey the head of the house? Everything would go wrong, and it would be necessary to chastise them. In Japan there is only one Head of the Empire, and all ought to obey him."

"We are loyal to him. If we are only permitted to be Christians, the Government would have no more faithful servants than we are."

"You disobey the laws by following a foreign religion. Do you not see that you will be put to death and that your families will suffer for your offence? Withdraw from here. Consult with your friends, your wives and your children. Perhaps they will be wiser than you are. Away with you\!"

April 29, one hundred and eighty heads of Christian families in Urakami were called before the Governor. As before, Dominic was the chief speaker. After all had declared that they could not give up Christianity, they were told:

"Instead of trusting your rulers, who are the father and mother of the people, you allow yourselves to be deceived by the French priests. They seek only the conquest of the land. That is the reason why your religion has for so long a time been prohibited, as it will continue to be, whatever changes there may be in the government. You are traitors, since you do not adore Ama-terasu, who came from heaven to create Japan and who perpetuates herself in the person of the Mikado, her direct descendant, and in the officials, who are his representatives. What have the French and other priests done that you should ally yourselves with them? What complaint have you to make against the Son of Heaven and his officials, that you will not submit to them?"

"If we are disobedient," said Dominic, "let us be put to death. It is what we desire."

Once more the Christians were dismissed that they might reflect on what had been said. There were many rumours about what would be done to them. It was said that twenty were at once to be put to death, while the others would be tortured. The day and the hour on which the execution was to take place were said to have been fixed, and people from the neighbouring country began to flock into Nagasaki in hopes to see the spectacle. The foreign consuls in a letter that they addressed to the Governor General of Kyushu, said that they had no desire to interfere with the rights of the Government, but since there were persistent rumours that a general persecution of the Christians had been planned, they desired to make an earnest remonstrance against what would certainly injure Japan's reputation with Western nations.

On May 14 the Supreme Council of the Emperor sent the following circular to the provincial governors:

"Among the inhabitants of the village of Urakami near Nagasaki there have always been some persons who have not ceased to follow the Christian religion; but in recent years their number has grown from day to day until the whole village, consisting of about three thousand inhabitants, practise that religion. The tribunal at Nagasaki is greatly troubled over this matter. It has vainly tried by all sorts of expostulations to bring these people to repentance. At the beginning of the new system of government we cannot, without exposing the country to most serious perils, permit this to continue. Measures of repression must be taken at once. The leaders must be called together and an attempt be made to detach them from their belief by kind exhortations. If they yield, they must be made to destroy their books and religious images and then to take a vow before the national gods. In case they do not heed the exhortations, nothing remains but to adopt strong measures. The leaders must be arrested and beheaded, their heads being exposed as a warning. Others must be transported to distant provinces where they shall be employed in various kinds of labour. In this way it will doubtless be possible to root out the beliefs that they cherish. Those that in time show signs of repentance shall be allowed to return to their villages. While the gravity of the crime may render these methods necessary, they are nevertheless extreme measures. Hence, before putting them into execution, each daimyo is requested to state without reserve his opinion upon the subject."

Okuma Shigenobu \(afterwards Count Okuma, the well-known statesman\) had been one of the officials in Nagasaki at the time when Christians were first arrested under the new Government. A few days later he was appointed an Assistant Councillor of State and called to Kyoto. Immediately after his arrival, the Supreme Council held a meeting to consider what action should be taken in connection with protests made by the foreign representatives against the treatment of the Christians. As no others had any definite plan to propose, they finally agreed with Okuma's contention that yielding to the demands of the foreigners would be such a lowering of national dignity that a refusal ought to be given, even though it should lead to war. Accordingly at a conference held at Osaka with the foreign ministers he was the chief speaker. His own account of the meeting will show the view taken by the Japanese and some of the difficulties with which the Government had to contend:

"I said: 'I am one of those who arrested and examined Christians in Nagasaki. . . . We cannot grant your request for releasing the prisoners and withdrawing the prohibitions against Christianity. Foreign countries are not justified in interfering when we punish our people according to our laws. Hence we do not think it necessary to discuss the matter with you."

"Sir Harry Parkes, the English Minister, was very angry. He shook his fist and struck the table as he said: 'This is insolence; this is going too far. Religion and truth are universal. Men are free to follow this religion or acknowledge that truth as they deem right. Among civilised nations, there is none that docs not permit liberty of belief. To have laws punishing people who have done nothing wrong, to erect barriers for shutting out the truth, is a shame for even a barbarous country. You do not realise what you are doing. You are rejecting the friendship of other lands. You ought to consider the condition of Japan and think of its future.'

"I answered: ' You cannot hope to move us by such simple arguments as these. I know a little about religion and religious history. Christianity, indeed, contains some truth; but it must not be forgotten that its history is filled with evil. A historian has said that the history of Europe is the history of strife; and a religious writer says that the history of Europe is the history of Christianity, If these authors are correct, the history of Christianity is a history of strife. Christ has not given peace to the earth but a sword. After the birth of Christ came the age of the popes. What was it that gave rise to great tumults and continually plunged the people of Europe into deep misery? From ancient times the rulers of different countries have often done cruel deeds; but what is it that has gone beyond kings in cruelty? How about the dungeons and the torments for punishing those who, as you say, simply held opinions differing from those of others? Of late, this evil has somewhat decreased in the West. This is because men's minds are expanding and they are not controlled by religion alone. In our country, conditions at present are different. From the first, Shinto has controlled men's minds. Buddhism also has had great power for over a thousand years. We are not lacking a religion. If at this time we should remove the edicts against Christianity and at the same time release its followers who have been arrested, Shintoists and Buddhists would rise up in anger and there would be a great disturbance. Of all disputes, none are more violent than those connected with religion. They suck out the blood, crunch the bones, and are never satiated. We cannot tell what sort of strife would arise in our land. Our statesmen must carefully consider this. In what happened at Nagasaki our Government did not make the first move. The people of different places came with their complaints and urged us to take action against the Christians. We were forced by reasons connected with the internal affairs of the country to take action and strictly suppress Christianity We thank you for your benevolent thoughts; but the facts being as stated, what else can we do?'

"Parkes became more angry and said: 'You are cowardly If you wish to accomplish anything you must expect some loss If you hesitate because of unwillingness to face difficulties, you can never attain success. Is not this an era of reorganisation? Why not destroy evil customs and come out into a broader world have known?, Christianity is now accepted by all civilised countries. Though some evils may have appeared in its history, its fruits are seen in the civilisation of this nineteenth century, Its excellence and truth are evident. Nothing is worse than to regard as an enemy what the whole world knows to be good, nothing is so foolish as to reject the truth. You ought to open your eyes. It is truly said that Oriental officials are so in the habit of looking only at what is directly before them that they never turn their gaze upwards. If you repeal the edicts and pardon the prisoners, you will find that your fears were needless it you do not take this action, I am sure that Japan is doomed'

I answered with a laugh: 'The day that we blindly follow the commands of foreigners will surely be the time of our nation's destruction. We are better acquainted than you with the state of affairs in our country. You think that what you desire can easily be done; but it is not so. Religious views that are the product of past centuries cannot be overcome in a single day We cannot endure to add another to the many things that are disturbing our country. In making purchases, one should not pay more than a reasonable price. We do not like to pay too high a price, as we should by purchasing Christianity at the cost of many human lives.'"\*

June 7, the very day that Mgr. Petitjean reached Japan on his return from Europe, another circular from the Supreme Council ordered the deportation of the Christians. It was accompanied by a list that specified how four thousand and ten of them were to be distributed among thirty-four daimiates. It was directed that "these persons shall be rigidly excluded from social intercourse until it shall have been proved that their hearts are purified. They shall be employed as labourers on ground requiring improvement, such as mines, collieries, etc. They shall live in forests." The daimyos should take care "to induce them to renounce their evil way, and if there be any who refuse to repent, severe punishment must be inflicted."\* Capital punishment was probably intended by this last clause.

The Governor-General of Kyushu now sent a tardy reply to the letter of the consuls in which he said: "We respect the humane feelings which dictated this letter, and we pity these perverse-minded Japanese subjects of the lower class who, in the face of an old established Japanese law, have committed the crime of apostatising to a strange religion. The practice of this is strictly prohibited, and we shall have no alternative but to punish them according to Japanese law if our repeated remonstrances do not cause them immediately to repent and retract their errors."

Kido, who had been one of the leaders in restoring power to the Emperor, was sent to Nagasaki to enquire concerning the Christians and to arrange for carrying the proclamation into effect. In an interview with the English Consul he said that so much animosity existed between the Christians and other Japanese of the lower classes that civil strife was feared by the Government, whose object was not so much to oppose Christianity as to preserve order. It did not wish to resort to extreme measures; but if the means now being taken did not produce the desired result, it would be necessary to punish the Christians severely. He believed that the missionaries still kept up secret communication with their followers in Urakami. A missionary seemed to him to be a man sent to Japan that he might teach the Japanese to break the laws of the land.†

The deportation of the Christians soon began. The first company, consisting of one hundred and twenty persons, was summoned July 20. Their friends, who followed them to the gates of the Governor's residence, were driven away with blows. The prisoners were taken on board a Japanese steamer, and at one time it was commonly believed that they had been taken to sea and drowned. It was afterwards learned that they had been divided among three provinces. Sixteen of them had been sentenced to death, but were reprieved in consequence of representations made by the foreign ministers.\* It was partly perhaps because of these protests and partly because the Government's attention was occupied in repressing its opponents in the northeast that there was a lull in the persecution.

On the evening of the day after the first deportation, M. Cousin embarked on a steamer that was starting for Shanghai. The anchor had been weighed, the customhouse officers had departed, and the steamer was moving slowly as though picking its way with difficulty among the other vessels in the harbour, when the captain's boat, which had been sent to shore, came quickly alongside, bringing with it ten lads, the seminarists from the Hall of the Immaculate Conception. They were taken on board and the steamer hastened on its way. M. Cousin took his pupils to the college at Penang. Four of the boys died there, while three others were unable to keep on with their studies. The remaining three afterwards returned to Japan, where in 1882 they were ordained as priests.

The Christians in Urakami now openly practised their religion, for they knew that it could not he concealed. There was not a day when some persons belonging to the families of those that had been exiled did not go to the church in Nagasaki. M. Laucaigne, disguised as a Japanese, often went by night into the valley in order to administer the sacraments to the dying.

Several Buddhist sects requested that the Christians be put in their charge so that attempts might be made for their conversion; but Buddhism itself was not in favour with those now in power, and the petition was rejected.\*

November 12, in Hisakashima, a small island belonging to the Goto group, twenty-two heads of families were arrested and taken to the chief town of the islands. Immediately afterwards, with the exception of six young men who escaped, the whole remaining population, men, women, and children, one hundred and eighty-one persons in all, were shut up in the house belonging to one of them, this improvised prison being so crowded that there were seventeen persons to a single mat.† The food given them was insufficient. One child and one old person soon died. There were arrests in other places. In January, 1869, a letter of instruction from the Supreme Council warned the Daimyo in Goto that in taking action against the Christians care should be exercised that nothing concerning it should become known outside.

At about this time a registration was made of all those families in Urakami from which no members had been deported. This proceeding led to fear that more arrests would soon be made. The number of the prisoners at Omura had been greatly lessened by death, there being in January, 1869, only seventy-eight survivors of the one hundred and twenty-three that had been incarcerated less than a year and a half before.

The persecutions at the Goto Islands became known to the foreign ministers, so that they sent a new protest to the Imperial Government. After a while the reply came that an officer sent to make an investigation had reported that there had been no persecution. Thereupon the ministers presented a detailed statement prepared by Mgr. Petitjean, which gave particulars concerning four hundred persons who had been arrested. Many of them had been tortured, while two men, three women, and twelve children had died under the treatment received. The particulars concerning the death of the men was given as follows:

"1. Paul Sakeichi, aged 79 years, arrested the 12th November, was beaten with an iron rod and thrown in prison, where he died toward the middle of December, of hunger, cold, and the blows he had received.

"2. Francis Rikiso, aged 55, son of the above Sakeichi, arrested the same day as his father, was, after being beaten almost to death, submitted to the torture named *sangtshino seine,**\** during which he fainted. On recovering consciousness, he was, on the following day, tortured again; the executioners beat him with iron bars, putting live coals into his mouth. Again it was thought he was dead. Thrown into a prison where he had scarcely room to rest his bruised body, he was soon nothing but one living sore, and died after three months of agony, on the 17th February, 1869, His body was left unburied for four days and nights in the midst of the prisoners."†

In the year 1869 arrests occurred from time to time. The protests of the ministers appeared to have little effect except that in the Goto Islands the number of those kept in confinement was reduced in June to twenty-seven, all of whom were heads of families. These were told that ere long they would be put to death unless they gave up their religion. The others were kept under surveillance, and those that were able to do so were made to work in the fields. Mr. De Long, the United States Minister, received from the officials of the Foreign Department the following communication:—

"In reply to the letter received in the fifth month of last year, we now beg to inform your excellency that we duly inquired into the alleged ill-treatment of Christians from the officers in charge of the Goto Islands; and as their statement did not appear to us sufficiently explicit, we directed some officers from Nagasaki to visit those islands and investigate the matter on the spot. Altogether there were more than one thousand persons on those islands who professed Christianity. Out of those, three hundred and thirty-five were reconverted to their own country's religion after having been gradually advised and disciplined. Five hundred and ninety-three were kept in prison, where they continued to receive advice, and one hundred and forty of these persons escaped from their prison.

"It having been reported that some of those had formed a, conspiracy to rise against authority, they were caught and tried, and those who did not confess were coerced in the usual way in order to extort confession from them; but they have not been struck with iron rods, nor has fire been put into their mouths, as mentioned in your letter. Moreover, the prison, so-called, was simply a dwelling-house arranged in such a way that the persons kept in it could not go out during the night. During the daytime they were permitted to work on their farms. Of this large number, some have died from natural causes, but not from any cruel treatment administered. Those persons received a much gentler treatment than is usually accorded to criminals under the laws; and since special laws were issued during the last sixth month relative to Christianity, ill treatment of native Christians has been forbidden, and we believe therefore that the cruelties reported to have been practised are simply the result of rumours without foundation..."\*

January 7 another communication from the same officials said that it had been decided to transport all the Christians remaining in Urakami; "our reasons being that if those Christians remain undisturbed, from the unfriendly feelings of which they are the objects, difficulties will inevitably arise between them and their neighbours, and in this manner it will become troublesome to govern those country people. In conclusion, we beg to state that, all rumours that may be circulated notwithstanding, those people will not be subject to any severe labour."†

Early in January, 1870, all the Christians of Urakami, about three thousand in number, were embarked on two steamers. The men were first sent on board and were followed by the women and children. Those of the women who had been admitted to the sacraments wore upon their heads the white cloths that had been given to them as veils at the time of their baptism. Many were seen to make the sign of the cross as they got into the boats that bore them to the steamers.

The foreigners in Nagasaki were moved with pity and indignation. Nothing was effected by a protest of the consuls; while Sir Harry Parkes, the English Minister who arrived in Nagasaki while the Christians were being collected, asked in vain that the proceedings be delayed for fifteen days in order that he might have time to communicate with the Central Government. On his return to Tokyo, he joined with the representatives of the other treaty powers in asking for a conference with the highest officers of the state. The request was granted, and the meeting was held January 19. It was attended by Sir Harry Parkes, and Messrs. Outrey, De Long, and Von Brandt, the representatives respectively of Great Britain France, the United States and Holland. Among the Japanese were Prince Sanjo, the Prime Minister; Sawa and Terashima, Ministers of Foreign Affairs; and eight members of the Imperial Council. Some extracts from the report of the proceedings will show the position assumed by each party in the controversy:

Sanjo. "Since last year the Government has had a full opportunity of discovering and understanding the character of the Japanese people who profess Christianity, and it has learned that they have become troublesome, and if allowed to proceed unchecked will subvert all governmental authority, interfere with trade, and seriously affect the relations of the Government with foreign nations. This Government does not move these people on account of their religious professions, but on account of their having been for a long time ungovernable and insubordinate, and on this account the Government has determined to change 'their residence. The Government heretofore removed some of them and has treated them with kindness, and those now being removed are being treated in the same manner, and consequently we do not think that we have destroyed or violated the promises made by this Government last year to the foreign representatives. this Government, in allotting to these people new residences, has not been persecuting them..."

Parkes. ". . . My own judgment of this', and I am sure it will be of my Government, is that this was a most cruel proceeding the only reason assigned being that these people professed the Christian religion, and that is the religion of my countrymen. Such an act when known in England will produce a bad effect and be looked upon as a most unfriendly act. . . . If a few of these people commit wrongs, punish them; but to visit this punishment on families and on thousands is contrary to our view of right...

Outrey. "In my opinion there is a misunderstanding about a word. You said you would act 'mildly' towards native Christians. I suppose the greatest punishment you consider you could inflict is death, and I suppose what you mean by 'mild treatment' is that you will not *kill.* This is not our understanding of 'mild treatment,' In our country it is regarded that a man taken from his family and banished is most cruelly treated....."

Iwakura. "There is a misunderstanding. We consider that we have acted mildly and as we promised. These persons recently deported have had their families sent with them, and this cannot be called severe punishment. They have lands assigned them and an opportunity given them to make a living as they had before. Heretofore the punishment for this offence was crucifixion. This we had moderated at the request of the foreign representatives, but you know that in Japan, where all the people believe in one religion, a sudden change or the sudden introduction of a new religion would produce great and constant political disturbances. Our object now is to converse on this subject. If in the future we understand and believe it to be necessary we will still execute this order. If it was only for those people at Urakami believing in Christianity, this Government would never have thought of moving them. Whether it is on account of their religious belief or because bad persons seek refuge there, we do not know; but trouble ensues and the only way we know of correcting it is dividing them up and sending them away. This is done solely on account of their acts of insubordination."

Outrey. "This is not in accordance with the letter you wrote us. I will ask what are those things in which they are disobedient? Is it because they profess Christianity or not?"

Sawa. "I was myself for a long time Governor of Nagasaki, and I know all about these people. What I now say is that it is not owing to the influence of missionaries that criminals from neighbouring daimyos' clans take refuge in these Christian villages and are there received; they then profess Christianity, are baptised, etc., and when the Government officers seek to apprehend them, collisions ensue between these Christians and the forces sent to apprehend them, while, in fact, these men are robbers."

Outrey. "I wonder that you have the power to punish a whole village and not a few persons in it. There is contradiction here."

Sawa. "I did not mean to say that we could not arrest them, but that the whole people of the village would resist our officers, pretending that the man was being arrested on account of his religious faith when really it was for some crime he had committed."

Terashima, "The villagers among themselves are extremely hostile toward those in the same village not of the same religious faith; that is, among our people it is quite usual for one to help another in necessity by making little loans of salt or provisions. When asked such favours, these Christians would not grant them unless the others would profess Christianity; and many have thus been starved or driven into professing Christianity. Their conduct has been constantly overbearing. They have not come to open hostilities, but they have pursued a system of vexation and intimidation so oppressive that it has led many to leave...."

\*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    

Sawa. "The upshot of this matter is that we do not move these people on account of their profession of the Christian faith, but on account of their actions, and this Government would have pursued the same course with any other people; and unless we do this we do not know how we will govern them."

Outrey. "How many people?"

Sawa. "About five thousand."

Outrey. "How many Christians?"

Sawa. "About three thousand."

Outrey. "Three thousand are troubling two thousand, and you remove the three thousand?"

Sawa. "Yes."

Outrey. "I thought there were four thousand, according to this decree."

Sawa. "This included native Christians in neighbouring villages."

De Long. "Has the decree of deportation which was published last year been repealed or amended?"

Sawa. "It was left in abeyance for awhile on account of our internal troubles. It has not been repealed or amended."

Terashima. "We were prevented from carrying it out also on account of the expenses we should have had to incur, these Christians not being treated as criminals, but they were provided with houses and lands, besides their number being very large. We have hoped the respite given them would induce them to amend their ways. In this we were mistaken."

De Long. "Then the decree now being enforced is the original decree?"

Sawa. "Yes, but in a milder form; and we shall explain the difference to you."

Terashima. "Formerly only the men were to be deported; now they are not separated from their families, and they will even be furnished lands and houses."

\*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    

Iwakura. "If this Government has prohibited the Christian religion in Japan, it is not because it is opposed to it, but because we foresee great troubles to ensue from it, as, for instance, if one man in a hundred becomes converted to that faith it would lead to a splitting up and dividing of the people. Formerly the laws against this were very strict; now they are three or four degrees milder than formerly but we cannot allow it to be professed generally."

Von Brandt. "We do not ask you to allow the free exercise of it, but we do ask that men who do profess it shall not be punished for professing it; in this there is a great distinction. I ask no change of laws, but simply to allow those who do profess Christianity to remain without being tortured for their faith."

Iwakura. "You must consider the motives of our Government, as, for instance, the native Christians formerly sent from this village to Choshu are all to be returned now as they have recanted their professing of Christianity."

Outrey. "This is a contradiction. This proves that it was because they professed Christianity that they were punished, as now that they have recanted, their punishment ceases. If all would now publicly recant their professions of Christianity, would they all be allowed to remain?"

Iwakura, "Yes; if they follow the religion of their Emperor and obey the authority of the Government, no reason for their punishment exists."

\*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    

Terashima. "If I said that this was being done on account of the religion of these men, it was true in only one sense; but the main reason is that in consequence of their professing the Christian religion, they despise their own. According to the Shinto religion, the Mikado is the direct descendant of the gods. Thus he rules by divine right on account of his divine origin. Christianity teaches our people to despise and disbelieve this feature of our faith, and thus it brings this sacred thing into contempt. As, for instance, these Christians, instead of going to the Shinto temple in Urakami sacred to the Mikado and worshipping, they refuse to do it and thus treat the Mikado contemptuously and lead others to show disrespect to him."

Outrey. "How comes it. if this is the reason of your opposition to Christianity, that you do not punish the Buddhists? The Mikado is the chief of the Shinto faith, and he cannot be the chief of more than one religion."

Terashima. "The Buddhists show their respect to the Shinto faith by agreeing to this principle."

Outrey. "Yes; but they have their own temples and priests. Do they compel them to go to the Shinto temples and pay their respect?

Iwakura. "In Japan, whether Buddhists or not, they have respect for and adore Tensho Daijin, the ancestor of the Mikado, as such, but Christians do not. They insult and ridicule her, and of course thereby insult and ridicule the Mikado."

Von Brandt, "How do they insult her?"

Terashima. "In Urakami, at this temple of Tensho Daijin, they have a peculiar gate sacred to the Mikado's ancestor. These Christians never will go through this gate, but go around it, and thus show all the people how they despise the goddess, and teach others to despise her also, Then, in all Shinto houses the people have idols, family gods, and also sacred writings; they insult these idols and put the sacred writings in indecent and filthy places to show the people how they despise them, There is a place there called Shibakaru, with several little red gates, and inside these grass grows, which people gather, and they will throw this grass through these gates and go around after it rather than pass through it. This action itself may be small, but the feeling exhibited is great and shows disrespect to the Mikado and his ancestor. The systems of government here and in Europe, you must bear in mind, are different. There the people have more or less to do with the government; here they have nothing to do with it; and to maintain this government it is absolutely necessary for us to compel all the people to believe in the divine origin of the Mikado, and respect and reverence him and his ancestors."

After consulting together the foreign representatives declared their belief that the people were being persecuted on account of their religion, and urged that such proceedings should be discontinued. The Japanese officials continued to insist that, as expressed by Iwakura if Christianity were permitted, "the Government cannot be carried on, because the Government is based on the Shinto religion." They also complained as follows of the action of the missionaries:

Terashima. "In referring these religious questions to the treaties, it will be seen that the engagements are mutual; that foreigners in Japan can have their own places of worship and practise their own religion, and that neither foreigners nor Japanese shall disturb the other. This a\! least is the spirit of the treaty. Now, although we have given foreigners their own places of worship and have never interfered with them, we have found out that missionaries have established a place of worship at Urakami, not within the limits of the foreign settlement where they go at night and preach their faith."

Outrey. "They must not have this; it is the first I have heard of it.

Terashima. "Although it is not. perhaps, according to the letter of the treaty that foreign places of worship should not be attended by Japanese, we consider that foreigners have no right to go outside of the settlement propagating their faith, as they are doing It appears to this Government that these missionaries have also led these people so to act as to implicate them seriously That they have promised them assistance if troubled by our Government is evidenced by the fact that when we attempt to control them they always rush to these priests and complain to them. That we ought sooner to have come forward with our complaints against these priests we admit, and we are very sorry that we have not done it; but thinking that the shortest way would be to deal with our own subjects, we have let the matter go on. Now we regret this; for if we had sooner complained, it would have resulted in only ten or a hundred persons being moved."

Outrey. "I regret that you have never informed us of this; but I wish to say that this persecution commenced four years ago, and this shows that the more they are persecuted, the more they increase. We know that at a place in the interior where there were no priests, you have had to persecute these people for Christianity; and this we know from your own official newspaper."

Terashima. "That is true; but there are Japanese who are preaching Christianity."

Outrey. "Do you not know that in the time of the Tycoon \[Shogun\] your Government suddenly heard of four or five thousand native Christians? Were they not Christians from their fathers? And does not this prove that the more you persecute, the more Christians there will be?"

Terashima. "It is possible that those were people who were Christians before this; if so, they kept it still. The Government was not going so far as to try and find out the sentiments of a man's heart and punish him for them; but these men are seditious, and we cannot tolerate them. We will not say the missionaries advise this; but the people do defy the Government. The officers from Nagasaki inform us that they have turned one of the ten temples into a place of worship, and there the people assemble and await the missionaries, who come in the night and perform religious worship."

Outrey. "Destroy the houses there and stop it if it is not within the treaty limits."

Terashima. "These missionaries employ two-sworded men, who are outcasts, as sub-instructors, who go about teaching and it is owing to these that Christianity is propagated inland. Now, the reason we move these people is to take them from under the influence of these missionaries. To say the truth, Urakami and other such villages have become the asylum of outcasts, and there they congregate and claim that they are under the protection of foreign powers. I know well these people have been led to believe so."

Outrey, "We certainly have never any of us or our consuls given them any such assurances, and we have never heard of this before. We trust you will reconsider your actions, because it will cause great feeling in Europe and America, and may lead to serious results. We ask postponement and due reflection."

Iwakura. "I can only repeat that we desire friendly relations, but we must be allowed to govern our own people. We thank you for your evidences of friendliness, and we will send orders to postpone further actions pending this conference, and on this conference it will depend whether we go further or not. We have spoken of the wrongs of the missionaries, which you ministers cannot defend; and we hope it is in the power of you ministers to control these missionaries."

Outrey. "We will do what we can do to make our people in all cases do right."

De Long. "I state unhesitatingly that when any complaint is made to me of a wrong done by any American citizen, I shall always be as ready and willing to restrain or punish him as I am prompt to demand redress for my countrymen from this Government when I consider them aggrieved."\*

Two days after this conference, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs sent to the foreign representatives the following report that had been made to them January 9, 1870, by the officials in Nagasaki:

"We beg to report that up to yesterday we continued sending off the native Christians to various provinces as set forth in the accompanying paper, taking good care, in conformity with the instructions received, to treat them kindly and tendering them advice. Heads of families were provided with money, and the sick who applied for relief were sent into hospital. The old and infirm were furnished with sedan chairs in places where the road was rough, and sandals for travellers were given to all. Families were not separated, in accordance with your instructions, but some were sent to different places at their own request We allowed them to take whatever they required of their own goods and such as were eft behind were placed in strong warehouses to await your further orders as to its disposal. As it was exceedingly cold and snow falling at the time, we furnished all with *sake* to use on the road as and when they pleased. Strict orders were given by us to those officers who accompanied them to provide whatever could contribute to their comfort, it was clearly explained to them that all reasonable wants they may have shall be duly supplied in the provinces whither they are sent, and they all left cheerfully and in good spirits."†

As will be seen, the Japanese constantly asserted that there was no cruelty, but in after years one of the officials related the following incidents. It is not stated with which of the successive banishments they were connected:

"Men and women were bound and passed from hand to hand across the gang-plank of the boat which waited to carry them, handled and counted and shipped like bales of merchandise. One woman, thrown amiss, fell into the water, and her hand waved farewell in the sign of the cross as she sank never to rise again. The other concerned a woman too, a mother with her infant at her breast. The officials determined to force her to recant, and failed. At last they took her infant, placed it just beyond her reach, and there let it wail its hungry cry two days and nights, with promises all the time of full forgiveness to the mother and the restitution of her babe, if only she would recant. Recant she would not, and at last her tormenters gave in, their cruel ingenuity exhausted."\*

January 28 the Ministers of Foreign Affairs presented the following memorandum, which may he taken as the official statement of the Japanese side of the controversy:

"They \[the Japanese ministers\] understand that the foreign ministers are dissatisfied with the measures taken by the Japanese Government relative to the native Christians.

"Appreciating friendly intercourse and the respect of the treaty powers for Japan, they have deemed it their duty to explain their motives for these measures; that the inhabitants of the village of Urakami are wrong in worshipping a foreign religion is not the question, but as co-religionists they formed a party and thwarted the authorities. The Government would not treat these people severely simply because of their worship. The Government never inquire what religious opinions people inwardly profess and as long as they infringe no laws or offer no resistance, though there may be many who profess foreign religions, they will not be interfered with. And hence, since the conclusion of treaties with foreign countries, has the Government abolished the law of *fumi-e* \[trampling on Christian emblems\] which was established for the purpose of inspecting people's hearts.

"The Government have engaged in their schools to teach languages, etc., those who come here as missionaries and have permitted any one to translate and sell publicly all sorts of books, even such as relate to religions. This proves that the Government intends to change the law respecting religion; but when the people commit wrongs and misdemeanours, infringe the laws of the country, or resist the power of the Government on the plea of being Christians, or when they are told by missionaries that they will not be punished, as foreigners will protect them, then the Government must step in, as such things cannot be permitted. Advice must then be given to such people and they must be brought back to submission to the laws of their country.

The Government carries out the treaty in allowing foreigners to worship their own religions and build churches in Japan; but they are dissatisfied with foreign priests who induce the people to worship with them. They use soft speech and science, or give money to those who worship their religion, telling them that foreigners will aid them, and the people consequently become so outrageous as to insult the authorities, and this must be remedied On investigation, it has invariably been found that these so-called native Christians are only so in name; their acts, however, are such as would undoubtedly be punished in all other countries. They conceal among themselves all sorts of criminals whom the Government wants to have arrested; they always disputed with others and caused disturbances; insulted our ancient religion, destroyed images of the gods, and defile the gods from whom his Majesty the Mikado is descended. If these people were left alone they would cause great trouble, the Government might be weakened, and the country endangered. It would have been quite proper to punish these people severely; but, as it was promised in January, 1869, by Higashi Kuse to the foreign ministers that they would hereafter be treated leniently, the Government had no other means in dealing with this matter than to remove these people to other places and thus cut off their communication with priests, whose desire of converting them may not be bad but unfortunately the Japanese misapprehended the matter and insulted the authorities. The Government removed them in the manner as promised to the foreign ministers. No severe treatment was inflicted, but all necessary aid was rendered. This the Government is prepared to prove

\*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    \*    

"The Japanese Government will not be obliged to resort to such measures as the unpleasant one referred to, if foreign missionaries would exclusively apply themselves to the teaching of their own people according to the treaty, instead of acting improperly as hitherto. Then the Japanese Government may not be obliged to cut off the communication of those of their people who seek information on religious subjects with the missionaries, and may further have no objection to send back to their village those who have been moved out of it.

"The Japanese Government are desirous that their people be instructed in arts and sciences, in which your country is superior, instead of being instructed in religion, and they are, above all, desirous that the existing friendship between our countries may increase more and more."\*

A week later the foreign representatives presented the following memorandum:

"The Japanese Government having declared that the action of some foreign missionaries in preaching outside of the limits of the foreign settlement has caused serious disturbances, and is one of the reasons for which the Government thinks the removal of the native Christians from the neighbourhood of Nagasaki is a political necessity, the foreign representatives do not hesitate to declare that they, on their part, will do everything in their power to restrain the foreign missionaries from such acts, and will punish them therefor if such acts be persisted in; provided, that the native Christians who have already been deported from Urakami are all brought back."\*

As might be supposed, the missionaries were far from pleased at the attitude taken in this last memorandum. Moreover, they put little faith in the promise that the exiles would be returned to their homes. M. Laucaigne decided to leave Japan for the present. He took with him thirteen of the young seminarists whom he had been instructing in the Hall of the Immaculate Conception, and went with them to Canton to continue their education.

It was at first difficult to find out anything about the condition of the exiled Christians. It was learned after the cessation of the persecution that their treatment varied greatly in the different provinces. The Buddhist and Shinto priests were charged with the duty of trying to bring about apostasy, and when their discourses failed to produce the desired effect, recourse was often had to torture. The worst treatment was suffered by those sent to Iwami and Nagato. Among those in the former of these provinces was Dominic Zenemon, who, it will be remembered, had been the spokesman of the Christians when they were called before the officials in Nagasaki. He was in the first company of exiles. With twenty-seven others he was enclosed in a small room connected with a Buddhist temple in the town of Tsuwano. Though the weather was bitterly cold, they were allowed no fire. The food served them was very insufficient. There was so much curiosity among the people of the town to see the prisoners that the officials decided to examine them in public. Four or five hundred people were present. The officer said to Dominic:

"Who is it that you worship?"

"We Christians worship the One who created Heaven and earth and all mankind. It is because He is the Lord of all that we worship Him. You, too, are under obligation to do so, since He created you also."

"No, no\!" said the officers with a laugh, "we do not worship Him."

"It is true that you do not, for you do not know Him; but it is none the less true that you ought to do so."

"We follow the religion of our own country; but you, although a Japanese, follow the religion of foreigners You are disobedient to the Emperor,"

"It is not of much importance whether a person belongs to one country or another. He who made other lands made Japan also. Hence Japanese, like other men ought to worship Him, The deities that are worshipped in Japan have created nothing, and, therefore, have no claim on our worship. You speak of the Emperor. We surely have no desire to oppose him; but the God who created the world created him also. The Emperor and his ministers, like all other men, ought to obey God. Moreover, we Christians pray for the Emperor's prosperity. Our religion commands us to do this."

"Nevertheless, if you do not renounce this religion, you will be put to death. On the other hand, if you are docile, you will be sent to your homes."

"Do with us whatever you will; we cannot renounce our religion."

This was the first of many occasions on which the Christians were summoned before their judges. On one occasion, when they had been urged in vain to give up their religion, the principal officer threatened to throw them all into a pond of ice-cold water that was near by.

"Do as you please," said the Christians, "we cannot give up our faith."

"Well then, go back to your prison. To-day only Zenemon shall be punished."

Thereupon Dominic, who was in a weak state of health, was led to the pond, while the people crowded around to see the sport.

"Take off your clothes and jump into the water," commanded the officer.

"No. If you wish, you may strip off my clothes, but I will not do it."

"What? You will not obey? Do you forget that it is in the Emperor's name that I command you?"

"I am not obliged to obey you in this thing, and I will not."

All the officers joined in ordering him to take off his clothes. He refused to do so, but made no resistance when one of the servants began to strip him. Exposed to the cold winter air, he stood in silence. To all the commands to jump into the water he simply said;

I am in your power. Do to me whatsoever you will."

Some one finally pushed him into the water, which, as he recovered his footing, was waist-deep. Though his whole body shook violently from the chill, he joined his hands in prayer and remained silent. The officers commanded him to kneel. This time he obeyed; keeping his clasped hands above the water. Soon, however, the cold so weakened him that his hands fell of their own weight. His tormentors dashed water over his head, and it was only when his strength was nearly exhausted that he was taken back to the prison, where the officers showed a little mercy by allowing a fire to be made of straw, before which he lay as his companions chafed his limbs and covered him with their own garments. Afterwards other prisoners were thrown into the pond.

When the second company of exiles reached Tsuwano, they also were severely treated. Even the women were sometimes deprived of clothing and exposed for two or three days to the winter air, no food being allowed them during that time. By these and other means a few were led to apostatise. As it was thought that Dominic had much to do with encouraging the others to be steadfast, he and two of his companions were shut up in a dark room swarming with vermin, and were not allowed to leave it at any time. The two who were with him died ere long and were replaced by others. Their food was gradually diminished. They commenced to dig a tunnel, hoping to get out where they could find some nourishment, This was discovered by the guard, who with a spade struck Dominic over the head and shoulders, wounding him so severely that his two companions had much trouble in staunching the flow of blood. Some of those who by apostasy had gained a considerable degree of liberty learned of this and found means for sending medicine and food to Dominic.

It is not necessary to continue the narration of the sufferings of the prisoners in this and other provinces. The Central Government constantly asserted that the exiles were being treated with kindness; hut when rumours came that those in Kaga were subjected to much cruelty, the British Acting Consul at Niigata was sent to investigate their condition. He found this much different from what was alleged by the officials. Husbands had been separated from wives, and children from their parents; no land had been allotted to the exiles; in many instances their food was insufficient, being increased only on condition of apostasy. At one place iron rings attached to the floor were fastened round the necks of men and women who would not give up their faith.\*

Mgr. Petitjean, who had been in attendance at the Vatican Council, returned to Japan in December, 1870. He at once authorised the missionaries to renew their nocturnal visits to Christians living near Nagasaki, but enjoined them to use the greatest prudence. He decided to take up his own residence in Yokohama. On his way thither he visited Kobe and Osaka, M. Cousin in the latter city was having frequent visits from the exiles. In some sections of the country they enjoyed a considerable degree of liberty, being able to be away from their guardians for several days at a time. One came from a place so distant that it took him five days to reach Osaka, while two others were eight days on the road. Afterwards people came even from the province of Kaga. The intelligence that M, Cousin was thus enabled to obtain showed that most but not all of the Christians were standing firm. He was able to send out catechists whose chief duty was to strengthen those that were in danger of apostasy. The persons in Kaga who had yielded began to show signs of repentance. They would come together in the evening to receive instruction from the catechists, and they asked to have their children baptised. Though the officials must have known of what was being done, they did not interfere.

In Nagasaki a time of calm had succeeded the storm. Though most of the Christians of the immediate neighbourhood had been torn from their homes, many remained in the Goto Islands and other places. Young men, nominally employed as servants of the missionaries, were instructed by them and then sent out as catechists. Every evening people came to the residence, so that in the first eight months of 1871, five hundred and fifty persons confessed and received the communion. The missionaries went to the bedsides of the sick when these were near enough to be visited in a single night. Mme. Salmon, the mother of one of the missionaries, took a large house near the church in order that she might provide a lodging place for the female catechists and for women that otherwise would not have been able to receive the sacraments.

In December, 1871, there was a renewal of the persecution. Sixty-five persons living in the vicinity of Nagasaki were sent into exile. Again the representatives of foreign powers uttered their protests; this time with more effect than before, for further arrests that had been ordered were not carried out, and six weeks later the sixty-five exiles, with the exception of one who had died, were returned to their homes. One reason for this act of clemency is to be found in the desire of the Government to obtain a revision of the treaties. In furtherance of this object, an embassy started for the West at just about the time the last arrests were made, and those who protested against the violation of the promise that no more Christians should be deported were also able to show that intelligence of what had been done would make the Western nations very unwilling to make such concessions as were desired by japan.

In March the Supreme Council issued to the local governments a notification concerning the persons who had been deported in 1869. This ordered: "If there are any of them who have manifested repentance, they shall be set free. According to their desires, they shall be registered among the inhabitants of your province or sent back to their former homes." A subsequent circular said: "Among the repenting Christians set free in accordance with the notification of March 9, 1872, are some who wish to be restored to their families, from which they find themselves separated. The prefects shall confer together in order to facilitate the re-union of households. If, notwithstanding such efforts, the location of members of the family cannot be discovered, the head of the family shall be sent to the place from which he was deported, and the local authorities of that place shall aid him to collect his household once more."\*

It will be seen that this last circular contains a disproof of the Government's former assertions that families had not been separated. Foreign officials were told that these orders were intended to include all of the exiles, and that the apparent restriction to apostates was to avoid offending public opinion, which was still strongly opposed to granting any concessions to Christians. Nevertheless, up to July, only five hundred persons had been sent back to Urakami, and all of them had bought their release by apostasy. "It was announced in Kaga," wrote M. Cousin in October, "that those who wished to return to Nagasaki had only to ask permission; but the essential condition was that they should sign with their own blood a promise never to profess Christianity, Only ten had the weakness to apostatise, and these were sent back at once. Nothing was said to the others. A general prison is being prepared, which they can leave only in the daytime and by permission of the chief of the guards." In some other places those that stood firm were treated more severely than before. Their liberty was so\_ restricted that the clandestine visits to the missionaries in Osaka became infrequent.

At this time, however, the missionaries had very much to encourage them. There had been several conversions at Hakodate, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. The work about Nagasaki had been more completely organised. The following statistics were given for that region:

 
Children of Christians baptised in 1871-72 650 to 700 Adult baptisms in 1871 350 Adult baptisms in 1872 1220 Confessions in 1871 1170 Confessions in 1872 1020 Communions in 1871 1050 Communions in 1872 1569 Confirmations in 1871-72 429 Extreme unction in 1871-72 71 
The number of persons receiving extreme unction was lessened by the difficulty the missionaries found in reaching those at the point of death. Persons dangerously ill were often brought from distant places to Nagasaki, in order that they might receive the ministrations of the priests. There were eighty-five catechists, men and women, more than half of whom had received careful instruction for four or five months; the men being sheltered at the residence of the missionaries, and the women in the house of Mme. Salmon. Twenty children, abandoned by their parents, had been placed in Christian families. In June, 1872, five nuns connected with the Society of the Holy Infancy had come to begin the work of gathering children into an orphanage.

Rumours of a change in the policy of the Government increased. By the end of 1872, the exiles were receiving more lenient treatment, and there were many indications that brighter days were at hand.

"EDICTS AGAINST CHRISTIANS REMOVED. PRISONERS FREED. INFORM ROME, PROPAGATION OF FAITH, HOLY INFANCY. NEED IMMEDIATELY FIFTEEN MISSIONARIES."

Such was the message written in March, 1873, by Mgr. Petitjean and sent to Hongkong for transmission by telegraph to the Missionary Society in Paris. Orders had at last been sent for the return of all the exiles, and ere long, companies of them began to arrive in Nagasaki. What joy for them to come back to their beloved valley, which some of them had not seen for more than three years, and others for five years\! What joy in the reunion of families that had been long separated\! What tales they had to tell of their experiences during the days since they had parted\! Vet all the feelings were not of joy. Many faces were missing. The statistics are deficient; but according to a table made out by the missionaries, those that had been deported from Urakami numbered 3, 404. There had been 660 deaths and 176 births in the time of exile, and the number of those returning in 1873 numbered 1,981. Apparently this last number does not include the 500 apostates of the previous year.

Those that returned were in great poverty. Many at the time of their departure had sold their lands at any price they could get, and they were now forced to cultivate less fertile ground on the sides of the mountains. The Government constructed barracks for those that had no other shelter. The Christians of other places came to the help of their brethren, and as the first harvest was bountiful, the severest stress was soon relieved.

The Christians that had been sent into exile had not suffered in vain. Not only had they been one of the means for bringing about religious freedom, but they had also impressed some people who saw them with profound respect for their faith. Hon. Ebara Soroku, a prominent Methodist and a leading member of Parliament, says that some of the exiles were placed under his care by a provincial governor, who afterwards became, like himself, a Christian and a member of the National House of Representatives. Various efforts, he says, were made to lead the exiles to apostatise. They were first brought into the presence of the officers, who attempted in vain to overawe them. When this method failed, young Christians were exposed to temptations that it was thought would surely lead them to such immorality as would bring disgrace upon their religion and loosen its hold upon them. Another fiendish plan was, after much thought, devised by the Governor. He caused a mother to be shut up with her infant and deprived of food. The mother, growing weaker and weaker, could no longer nurse the child. It cried from morning until night; but when food was offered to the mother on condition that she would renounce her faith, she replied: "I prefer to die and to kneel at the feet of my Lord," The Governor was so much moved by her steadfastness that he finally relented and ordered food to be given to the woman. Mr. Ebara says that the conduct of the exiles under suffering had great influence in leading him and others to become Christians in later years.\*

Hon. Kataoka Kenkichi, who was several times Speaker of the House of Representatives, says that in his city of Kochi about sixty of the Christians, before being sent back to their homes, were taken to a Buddhist temple in order that the priests might make one more effort to persuade them to renounce their faith. Their steadfastness so surprised the priests that it is said some of them decided to become Christians. Mr. Kataoka adds: "To the exiles I attribute my first leanings towards Christianity and my subsequent Christian belief."†

It will be seen that at the end of the period of persecution, the Roman Catholic missionaries had several thousand adherents. They counted the Christians directly connected with them as fifteen thousand, while they knew that there were many thousands more who considered that they held the faith of the ancient Christians, but who had not yet entered, as many of them afterwards did, into formal relations with the missionaries. In comparing the results of what has been accomplished by the Roman Catholic, the Greek, and the Protestant churches, the great number of adherents that the first had from the beginning must be remembered. On the other hand, however, it cannot be forgotten that its missionaries have laboured under the great disadvantage of being the successors of those who were believed to have brought great evils upon the country two hundred and fifty years before. Though the common people were slow to learn of any distinctions, educated persons were aware that there was a great difference between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Many who were bitterly prejudiced against the former were not unwilling to examine the teaching of the latter.

### DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHURCH 1873-900 

THE telegram in which Mgr. Petitjean informed his society of the release of the Roman Catholic exiles called for the sending out of fifteen new missionaries. Evidently the officials of the society felt as he did. that the needs of Japan were very pressing. The thousands of believers now in connection with the missionaries ought to be instructed, other descendants of the ancient believers were to be gathered in, it was necessary to plan for the training of native workers, and there was reason to hope that the changes now going on in Japan would open the way for winning many new converts. By September, eleven of the fifteen missionaries that had been asked for were on the field. M. Laucaigne was raised to the episcopate and made an auxiliary of Mgr. Petitjean. A seminary for the training of evangelists was opened in Nagasaki. One was already in operation at Yokohama. In the latter city twenty young men received instruction in lithography, so that they might multiply copies of the catechism and other books.

At the close of 1873, there were connected with the Mission two bishops, twenty-nine missionaries, six sisters, two hundred and twenty-seven catechists, and two hundred and fifty baptisers. There were three churches and twenty-seven oratories, two seminaries with seventy pupils, six boys' schools with two hundred pupils, one girls' school with fifteen pupils, and two orphanages with thirty-six inmates. The baptisms that year of "heathen adults" numbered one hundred and twenty; of "converted schismatics," five; of children of Christians, two thousand and seven; and of children of heathen, one hundred and ninety-seven.

The year 1874 brought severe trials to the Christians of Kyushu. An epidemic of dysentery in Urakami and other places caused the death of about one hundred of their number. The missionaries gave medical aid, while catechists and others nursed the sick. While the epidemic was still raging, a severe typhoon accompanied by heavy rains caused much damage. The barracks put up by the Government for the returned exiles yielded to the fury of the storm, which also blew down a large part of the houses in Urakami and some other villages. The fishermen in one place lost all but one of their boats. The rice-fields, which had given promise of abundant crops, were devastated. The price of food at once rose rapidly, and the condition of the Christians was so pitiable that an appeal to European charity was made by Mgr. Petitjean.

Another trial to the Mission was the burning in December of the residence of the missionaries in Yokohama. Religious utensils, books, and printing presses, were lost in the conflagration.

One consolation in the midst of these trials was that some of those descendants of the ancient Christians who had formerly held aloof from the missionaries now showed an inclination to enter into relations with them. Some of these "separated ones" *\(les séparés\),* as they were called, had known so many cases of betrayal by pretended brethren that they were very suspicious, fearing that, if they did not keep their faith a complete secret, they might be arrested and put to death. Even their children were left without instruction until they had arrived at the age of discretion, so as to avoid any danger that might come from their not keeping silence. After these persons were convinced that the missionaries were indeed the spiritual successors of those who had taught their ancestors, they held aloof because of hesitancy about associating with other Christians. Some even united with unbelievers in inimical acts towards those whom they ought to have regarded as their brethren. Yet some of them, when at the point of death, sought the services of the priests. The kindness shown to them by other believers at the time of the epidemic did more than almost anything else to lead many of them to give up their policy of separation.

Not only in the open ports, but also in the interior, there was an increasing number of conversions. In August, 1875, one of the missionaries baptised in the village of Matsunaga \(Suruga\) thirty persons who had received instruction from a catechist. Soon after this, the number of worshippers at the annual festival of a Shinto shrine in the neighbouring city, of Numazu was much smaller than usual, whereupon those that mourned over the diminution of revenue decided that the advent of Christianity must be held accountable. They accordingly induced the officials to call together the heads of families to read to them the following document:

"Every one knows that Japan is the Land of the Gods, and that the one hundred and eighty-two Emperors, commencing with Jimmu Tenno, have for 2,535 years ruled the country. Certain foreign religions that came from India and China have already spread through the land and have lessened the respect paid to the gods. In our days the religion of Jesus also, although its followers are still few, is striving to possess the land. From a patriotic point of view this is greatly to he regretted, since it is not right that a person by allying himself with a foreign faith should become unmindful of the claims of his own country. Therefore we have this morning assembled the inhabitants of Numazu in order that we may administer to them a solemn oath, which shall be confirmed by the ceremony of offering a cup of *sake* at the shrine. By this oath they shall make a promise that neither they nor their descendants will ever accept the Christian religion. If any one violates the promise, may the gods crush him under the weight of their curses."

The people, with the exception of one man, signified their willingness to take the oath. This one declared that, since he was a Christian, he could not do it. That evening he was called before the officers, who told him that he must write a statement declaring that he was a Christian. When he had done this, they asked him what were the chief teachings of his religion, whereupon he produced a catechism, from which he read the Ten Commandments and other important sections.

When the Christians of Matsunaga heard what had happened, they informed the missionaries, who at once sent two catechists, one of whom was well known in that region, as his father was the chief officer of Matsunaga. The catechists went to see the officials who had been responsible for forcing the oath upon the people, and got from them an acknowledgment that they had not received from their superiors any authorisation for such an act. Having also procured a copy of the document to which the names had been signed, the catechists next went to the Governor of the prefecture and gained his assurance that he was not responsible for what his subordinates had done. Returning to Numazu, they advertised that for a week they would hold preaching services in the house of the man that had refused to take the oath. Though the people at first were timid, the house was afterwards crowded with persons wishing to listen.

In other places there were similar attempts to get the people to sign promises that they would not accept the foreign religion. In one village, when a Christian refused to obey the summons to attend the assembly where the document was to be presented, half of the other villagers followed his example. The Buddhist priests in Numazu were now aroused to action. They did their best to decry Christianity, urging the people not to have even business relations with its followers.

"Paganism is not the only enemy of Catholicism," wrote one of the missionaries about 1874, as he commenced to describe the missionary efforts of the Protestants and of the Russo-Greek Church. He considered that the work of the latter was inspired by the political ambitions of Russia, and said:

"The popes exert all their efforts to gain adherents to schism and thus to Russian ideas. . . . For three years the Russian schism has established its centre of action at Tokyo, from which it extends its influence to the most distant provinces. The pope, with a zeal worthy of a better cause, has educated many catechists whom he sends into the interior, where he supports them at great expense." 

In 1876, Mgr. Osouf wrote that the Russian schism was losing ground, while Protestantism was "increasing and was paralysing the efforts of our missionaries by means of the publications that it lavishly scatters, and of the schools that it multiplies."

To meet what it regarded as dangerous heresies, the Mission published several books in opposition to the Protestants and Russians. Indeed, its literary efforts at this time were largely expended upon works of this kind. The most elaborate book was one in four volumes, "Seikyo Bumpa Ron" \("A Discussion of the Divisions of Western Religion"\), This, which was written as though by a Japanese, described the founding of the Christian Church, the way in which the Greek and Protestant divisions arose, and the evil nature of these great heresies. The spirit in which the book was written may be judged by the opening sentences of Vol. Ill., which treats of Protestantism:

"Having already in the Second Volume investigated the origin of the Russo-Greek Sect and shown its falsehood, evil, sin, and error, it is necessary in this Third Volume to speak of the myriad sects of Protestantism so as to show their falseness, stupidity, error, sin, and atrocious evil. Protestantism had its origin in such great sins as uncleanness, licentiousness, robbery, and tyranny. If I describe it, Japanese will look on it as so shameful and unclean that they will not wish to listen to its teachings or give their assent to it."

In speaking of the evils of schism, the writer says, that in America there are more than three thousand sects. Of Luther he writes: "From the creation of the world, never has such another wicked person been seen." Henry VIII., however, is described as being a close second, and Cobbett's "History of the Reformation" is utilised as a valuable witness for showing how even Protestant writers acknowledge the evils that accompanied and followed England's separation from Rome. The Greek Church does not fare much better than Protestantism in this exceedingly bitter polemic. Though the book may have furnished weapons for the opponents of all forms of Christianity, it may be doubted whether it helped the cause of those who issued it.

In 1876, the Propaganda decided that Japan should be divided into two vicariates; that of the south being committed to Mgr. Petitjean, who now removed to Osaka; and that of the north to Mgr. Osouf, who now made his residence in Tokyo.

At first but few converts were gained in Osaka. After having his hopes in many persons disappointed, M. Cousin in 1877 baptised seventeen adults; in 1878, twenty-one; and in 1879, forty. Hoping that descendants of the ancient Christians might be discovered in that part of the country as they had been in Nagasaki, he took care to follow up every promising clue. Information was received of several villages where it had been the custom for the officials to attend every burial in order to thrust a stake into the grave so as to prevent the resurrection of the dead person. It was thought that the apprehension implied by this act might be due to some misinterpretation of the Christian doctrine, and catechists were sent to explore the region. They found there a woman that knew the *Ave Maria.* She said that the officers still kept up the practice of driving stakes into the graves. When her husband returned from the fields, he declared that all the people of the village had once believed in Christianity; but he professed to have forgotten all that he ever knew about it. A few days after this, one of the missionaries went to see if he could find any believers; but the chief of the village, after learning of the visit of the catechists, had so threatened the people that only two families could be found whose members were willing to acknowledge that they were Christians.

In March, 1879, there were church buildings "worthy of the name" in the six cities of Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Kobe, and Hakodate. There were also fifty-five chapels and oratories. The Christians connected with the Mission numbered 20,146.

In 1880 Mgr. Petitjean removed to Nagasaki, he having become convinced that it was still the most important centre for the work of his vicariate. In the city itself some conversions had occurred, so that the number of Christians was about two hundred and fifty. A judge, who had taken part in the persecutions, expressed, shortly before his death, a desire to receive instruction, and he was finally baptised. The patience and resignation that he showed during his last days were so marked as to astonish the physician, who asked him how he was able to endure his sufferings without complaint, and to face death so courageously. "You would not be able to understand the reason, were I to tell you," was the reply; "let it suffice for me to say that I count myself happy in being permitted to suffer and then to depart from this life." In the Urakami Valley the Roman Catholic population was then reckoned as 3,370. Although one hundred families once included among the "separates" had returned to the pale of the Church, two hundred other families still held aloof. To a considerable extent the village had recovered its former prosperity. Strengthened by the persecutions through which they had passed, the Christians were fervent and zealous in good works. A missionary wrote of the valley as being one of the most Christian places in the world. There were chapels, schools, orphanages, a hospital, and a community of women who, while supporting themselves by tilling the ground or other occupations, also cared for the sick and orphans, taught the catechism to the children of the valley, and held themselves ready to do any work of charity to which they might he called. A large building, which had formerly been the residence of the officers charged with enforcing the laws against Christianity, where the ceremony of trampling on the cross had formerly been performed, and where ten years before the Christians had been convoked to hear the decree for their banishment, was purchased, and on July 7, 1880, the Feast of the Japanese Martyrs was celebrated by beginning the work of transforming this building into a church. Dominic, the old hero, who had stood so firm throughout the persecutions, obtained from the Governor of Nagasaki permission to erect a large stone cross on the summit of one of the hills that overlooks the valley.

At Nagasaki, on the last day of the year 1882, three young men, who the previous year had been made deacons, were ordained as priests. They had been in that company of boys that M. Cousin had taken to Penang in 1868. One of them was a son of Dominic. It is the belief of the Roman Catholic missionaries that, as a rule, it is unwise to induct to the priesthood those who have been converted from heathenism or even their children since they yet bear in their blood, as it were, such corruption as makes it doubtful whether they will not bring dishonour to the sacred office. The candidates for the priesthood should have behind them at least two or three generations of Christian ancestors. The discovery of the descendants of the ancient Christians has made it easier to follow this policy in Japan.

In Hirado and its neighbourhood were five or six thousand Christians under the care of the missionaries. They had constructed several chapels, and in 1883 they built a large church in the centre of the city. When they petitioned the local authorities to support them in their refusal to make contributions for Buddhist temples and festivals, not only was their request granted, but the Buddhists were ordered to restore property that they had taken from the Christians ten years before.

A letter written in 1883, by M. Fraineau gives such a vivid picture of some features of missionary life that the following abridgement of it will not be out of place:—

"I started, May 30, for Ichimanda, which is about twenty leagues south of Oita. In that village there were a few catechumens. A peasant who possessed the best house in the place had consented to take out an inn-keeper's license so that I might lodge there He was led to do this by no desire for religious instruction, for which he has always shown the most complete indifference, but by the love of the twelve *sous* that I promised to pay him daily for food and lodging.

"I installed myself in his house, with fleas, mosquitoes, and lice for my companions; for never have I seen a richer collection of these pests. It is the season when work in the fields is at its height, the farmers being busy harvesting wheat and preparing the fieIds to be planted with rice. The people that now serve as our landlords are labourers, in the morning, after absorbing a kettleful of a kind of vermicelli boiled with cabbage-leaves and wild greens, the whole household, including the cows and the horse set out for the field without paying any attention to my catechist and me. I ought to say in excuse for my hosts that the person who came to Oita to consult about my entertainment arrived on a fastday and so reported that I ate only one meal in \(he daytime. Thus, unknown to us, the fast had become a *sine qua non.* Behold then the catechist and me condemned to an enforced Lent three weeks long. I at one time thought of installing myself in the kitchen and leaving the people of the house free to reap their wheat and plant their rice in peace; but in the midst of heathen I could not indulge myself in such liberty. Dignity is more precious than life, and here it would be better for a person to perish with hunger than to lose prestige by condescending to occupations not appropriate to his sex and condition. Moreover, let us be patient; we shall be obliged to wait only until about two o'clock in the afternoon. It is at that time every day that the woman of the house, who has neither clock nor sundial. leaves her work and comes to see if we are still alive. In accordance with the rules of Japanese etiquette she always begins by bowing her head three times to the mat, asking us at the same time if we are in good health. She then makes many excuses, though without any real contrition, for having kept us waiting so long, and says that we shall be served with food immediately, this meaning about an hour later, since it is now that she lights the fire and begins to heat water for cooking the rice.

"In the evening it is about half past ten before we get anything more to eat. Here, as in a regiment of cavalry, the animals take precedence of the men. Before our needs are supplied, it is necessary that food should be prepared for the cows and the horse, to say nothing of the five goats that have been left from morning to night without food and are now stunning us with the noise they make in one corner of the house. However, a person that has had dinner at two o'clock can wait until half past ten for his supper. These two grand meals whose preparation has given our hosts so much trouble consist invariably of a dish of rice and some boiled bamboo-roots that have no other seasoning than an ancient flavour of salt fish with which the wooden cover of the family kettle seems to be saturated as the result of years and perhaps ages of use. Apart from such trifling defects, this is a very palatable dish. By adding vinegar and wearing green spectacles a person might make himself think he was eating asparagus.

"Let us come to more serious matters. The bonzes follow me everywhere, and I at least have the consolation of being able to say that, if they make me trouble, I also on my side give them abundant anxiety and annoyance. It is certain that at night they do not lie down in so tranquil a state of mind as I do. Yet it is not my laurels that keep them from sleeping; for thus far, in appearance at least, my labours have not been crowned with very great success.

"I had hardly set foot in the village of Ichimanda at ten o'clock of a dark night and in a pouring rain, before the temple more than a league distant that cares for this section of the country learned of my arrival and prepared a pastoral letter to warn its people of the danger that menaced them. At daybreak the next morning this letter was carried from house to house, read to the members of each family, and re-enforced by the comments of its bearer. This letter was the fifth or sixth edition of what the bonzes had already said or written elsewhere. Not only was it a tissue of calumnies, but it also contained menacing prophecies and invoked the anger of Japan's guardian deities upon all that dared to come near me. It said I was the cause of the rain whose constant fall for fifteen days had made the grain rot; the cause of the thunder which, as it appears, is more frequent than usual, while lightning has set fire to a farmhouse more than two leagues from the place where I am stopping; the cause of the floods that after the heavy rains inundated the fields to the destruction of the crops; etc., etc. These calamities are but the preludes of yet greater ones; for since my arrival flocks of crows frequently pass over the village by night with mournful croaks, and this is regarded by the heathen as a very evil omen.

"To the written lies are added such as the bonzes did not dare to put on paper, probably because they would appear too absurd; but these are propagated by word of mouth and are readily accepted by the credulous peasants. Here are some samples Leaves of trees are changed in my hands to bank-notes that afterwards resume their original form, so that a merchant who at the day's close shuts up in his safe the money received from me is likely at some future time to find in its place only a handful of oak-leaves. Hence it is always with fear and but poorly concealed hesitancy that people receive paper money from me, and I have to take special care that the notes are not of too high denominations. One day the people of a wayside inn where my catechist and I had eaten rice preferred to make us a present of it rather than give us change for a one *yen* bill. It is said that my glance will cause all sorts of evil to people that happen to meet me on the road when I am in ill humour; their bodies are likely some day to crumble into dust as suddenly as though they had been struck by lightning. By my mere wish I can poison the water in the wells, and I can confound my enemies while they are at a long distance from me.

"In the midst of these ill-disposed and hostile people I have found some friendly persons. There are some souls here that the good God seems to have chosen, and it was for their sakes that I came. Their instruction had been begun by Peter, a poor labourer who was baptised in March. On his return home he tried to teach others and succeeded in leading some families of the neighbourhood until there were more than a dozen applications for baptism. To them I was not a mysterious being, half man and half demon; I was not even a stranger; but I was the Lord's messenger, whose coming they awaited with impatience and who was able to induct their souls into a new life I was also received as a priest that had come among his children. It was a great joy for me to see the ardour with which, notwithstanding the labours of the day in what was a busy season of the year the poor people came every evening to hear an explanation of the truths of our holy religion. The catechetical instruction began immediately after our supper, that is to say, according to the custom of our hostelry, between half past ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, and it always ended after midnight by all reciting the evening prayer, which, as you see, ought to be the morning prayer. I need not tell you of the annoyances and troubles to which my new catechumens were subjected. Knowing already that the disciple is not above his Lord, they were resigned to all. There was only one thing that they could not bring themselves to accept. They did not wish that any one should insult them by calling them Christians. The doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to them too good and its morality too pure for them to be able, notwithstanding what the bonzes said, to confuse it with the tissue of crimes and magic of which the reports had come down to them from ancient times; and they persuaded themselves that the 'Religion of the Lord of Heaven' was certainly not the same as that preached by Saint Francis Xavier to their ancestors. With all their favourable disposition and their ardour to receive instruction, they would have been ready to give up everything the day they should learn positively that they were on the point of joining the sect of ancient Christians, so much does that name, sullied by the calumnies of the bonzes, arouse hatred and repugnance in the popular mind. In the beginning I had respect for their weakness and took the greatest care to avoid what would enlighten them too quickly. They needed to be prepared for the reception of that unwelcome truth.

"Finally the time came when I could no longer leave them in ignorance. It was a very solemn moment when on a beautiful sabbath evening, in commencing a catechetical exercise on the First Commandment, I told them that the religion they were about to embrace by receiving baptism was the very one that had been reviled for three hundred years, and that the God whom they ought to worship was even the same Jesus Christ who had been so despised in their country. This declaration came to them like a clap of thunder. The questions and cheerful remarks that had made our lessons so pleasant came to an end; all the heads sank in consternation to the mats; and the deep sighs that escaped from the breasts of these poor men attested the terrible struggle going on in their hearts. I was the only one to speak and often my voice betrayed even to myself how great was my emotion. It might be that this evening would see the end of all the hopes I had been cherishing. At the close of the meeting, when I asked them whether they were willing to give way before the calumnies of the bonzes or whether they would not have the courage to make a momentary sacrifice of their reputation for the sake of God who had so loved them and had died for them, all replied with a magnificent profession of faith:—

"'Not only of our reputation, but also of our property and of our lives. If we must be called Christians, we will use that name ourselves; and far from being ashamed, we will glory in it.'

"The news of this caused a great commotion in the village. The annoyances took a new turn and became a real persecution. The village mayor and the physician, the two great men of the village, were induced by the bonzes to put themselves at the head of the movement against the Christians. Especially did the mayor, aided by a subordinate, display an ardour worthy of a better cause. When he learned that our catechumens, instead of yielding, had thrown away their idols and were preparing for baptism, his anger could no longer be kept within bounds. Unmindful of the fact that he was acting not only against human rights but also against the laws of his country, which placed him in office to serve as a peacemaker rather than as a judge, he called all the heads of families to his office and opened a court as a Roman governor in the time of Nero or Diocletian might have done. He ordered our people to apostatise under penalty, in case of refusal, of having all their goods at once confiscated and given into the hands of their creditors, and of having all the village cease from having friendly relations with them. They would be forbidden to draw water from the village well, to cut wood on the mountains, to hold communications with other people, etc., etc. The mayor thought that in view of such threats the catechumens would hasten to submit. None of them, not even of the women, appeared alarmed or affected by his words, and all openly declared that, although they had not yet received baptism, they were already Christians at heart, so that, even though their heads were to be cut off, no one could make them give up their faith.

"Our catechumens held meetings by themselves—holy assemblies in which they exhorted one another to preserve carefully in their hearts the gift of faith which God had bestowed upon them and which the devil was trying to take away. Let me cite especially the noteworthy meeting where the patriarchs of the band addressed the little company to the following effect:—

Since our relatives and friends reject us, let us form a new family. Persecuted as we are for the same cause, let us unite our efforts so as to sustain each other. Let us have only one heart and one soul. Let us strengthen our courage by a mutual agreement, and though men may try to force us to deny Jesus Christ, let us here take an oath that we will remain faithful and be ready for any sacrifice rather than abandon Him.'

"Ere the meeting adjourned the form of the oath was settled upon, and the paper on which it was written was passed around the assembly. The men affixed their seals, while each woman pricked the point of a finger with a needle and so signed with her own blood."

Soon after this M. Fraineau returned to Oita. The last of July the catechist brought intelligence of the progress of events in Ichimanda. The threats made against the Christians had to some extent been put into execution. One man had been deprived of all his property, and it had been divided among the people of the village. Probably he had been in debt to the community. After having been driven from his house, this man was cared for by his fellow-believers. Two families, whose members were preparing for baptism, had been frightened by a visitor from Nagasaki, who said it was well known in that city that when any Christian was sick the priest knelt at his side and either sucked out his blood or drove a nail into his head. After this, whenever the catechist visited these families, the women and children kept out of sight, while the men made it evident that his presence was unwelcome.

During M. Fraineau's sojourn in the village the man in whose house he lodged had overheard much of the instruction that was given to the catechumens, and had himself shown some interest in Christianity. After the departure of the missionary he had ventured to take down his idols. Two nights later his horse suddenly died. Regarding this as a punishment for his rash deed, he had called a bonze to appease the anger of the deities, whose images he now restored to their former place.

The Christian charity of the believers had been shown by their treatment of a leper who had come to their village. The daughter of a *samurai,* she had become the wife of an Osaka merchant. Soon after the death of her husband, she found that she was a victim of the terrible disease of leprosy. Her brother shut her up in a sort of cage in order to keep her from the rest of the family, and she saw no one except the servant that brought food to her. After two years of this seclusion, she broke out from her cage with the intention of drowning herself. It was January. On reaching the river's bank, she could not get up courage to jump into the cold water. She therefore decided to make a pilgrimage to noted Buddhist temples in order to pray that she might be healed. As she was begging her way, she came to Ichimanda, where the Christians were so moved by pity, that one of them took her into his house while others saw that she was always supplied with food.

The two missionaries that had taken the most prominent part in the events connected with the discovery of the Christians in Nagasaki were taken at about the same time from the scene of their earthly labours. Mgr. Petitjean had for some time been aware that he had not long to live. It was his hope that before passing from earth he might be able to establish a station of his mission in the Loochoo Islands, where he had begun his labours for the Japanese. He had gone to Kagoshima with the intention of taking passage for those islands, but became so ill that he was taken back to Nagasaki, where he died October 7, 1884. Three months later, January 10, 1885, Mgr. Laucaigne, who had shared with him the hopes, the disappointments, the joys, and the perplexities of the early days of the Mission, also passed away.

M. Cousin was then made Vicar Apostolic for Southern Japan. M. Osouf, who was appointed to the like office in Northern Japan, was raising funds in America at the time these deaths occurred. He was at once summoned to Rome. Leo XIII. had just addressed a letter to the Emperor of China, and he now put a similar one for the Emperor of Japan in the care of Mgr. Osouf. The new Vicar Apostolic arrived in Yokohama in August, 1885, and through the French Minister made arrangements for being presented to the Emperor, by whom he was graciously received as the bearer of the Pope's letter.

About 1886, there was begun a charitable work that soon attracted the notice and admiration of European residents in Japan. A woman suffering from leprosy, and for that reason abandoned by her husband, had found shelter beneath a miserable roof that was built over the wheel of a rice-mill. Her bed was a coarse straw matting spread over the boards that formed the cover of the sluiceway. Her food consisted of a cup of rice bestowed daily by her relatives, who otherwise did hardly anything for her relief. The disease made rapid progress and she was soon totally blind. It is not strange that the temptation to take her own life often presented itself to her mind. In some way, however, she gained a knowledge of Christianity and desired to receive baptism, M. Testevuide, who was asked to administer the rite, says:

"While I was seeking upon her brow, disfigured as it was with leprosy, some place to apply the water, the woman wept; but it was now with a joy that brightened up her face, notwithstanding the sores with which it was entirely covered."

He could not bear to leave her in such a place. Her brother, who was displeased that a foreign priest had come to see her, showed no disposition to help in bettering her condition. M. Testevuide wished to get her into a hospital; but at that time there was in all Japan no place where such a patient would be received. His interest in this woman led him to reflect on the sad lot of thousands of Japanese who were suffering from the same disease. The desire grew strong in his heart to do something for the relief of these unfortunate persons. In a letter telling the bishop of his wish to devote his life to such work he said:

"I am not ignorant of the dangers to which I shall expose myself. Some day, perhaps, I shall see myself shut off from your society and that of my brethren. If God" in His just and merciful designs should permit me to be infected with the evil that I desire to heal in others, I will remind myself of the promise of our Lord Jesus Christ not to leave without reward a cup of water given in His name, and I will present myself at His tribunal with a greater degree of confidence. I will ask of you as a last favour only this, that you will permit me to live and die among my poor lepers."

Some friends gave him a small sum of money with which he hired a house in the neighbourhood of Gotemba, a town at the base of Mount Fuji. Though the house was far removed from other habitations, the people did not like the idea of having a leper hospital so near them, and they tried to get the owner to refuse to rent the house. M. Testevuide insisted for a time that the bargain already made should be kept; but finally, in order to avoid trouble, he sent away the few lepers he had gathered and set himself to collect money for the erection of a building of his own. The foreign communities in the open ports, always quick to respond to charitable appeals, soon furnished him with funds that enabled him to purchase a tract of about six acres, on which he erected a small hospital. There he lived in close intimacy with the lepers, alleviating their sufferings, cheering their hearts by his kind words, and giving them religious instruction. The best known methods of medical treatment were used. In some cases the external signs of the disease so far disappeared that the patients could go back to live once more with their friends. As M. Testevuide did not believe that complete cure could be effected, he always told such persons to come again for treatment the moment that there was a reappearance of trouble. Such patients as were able to do so, worked in the garden, which was thus made to furnish much of the food needed by the community. Japanese Christians were found who gladly gave themselves to the work of nursing the sufferers. Mention is made of one man that shut himself up for life among the lepers, making only the one condition that food should be provided for his own family. Such kindness as was shown by M. Testevuide and his associates could not fail to touch the hearts of its recipients and make them willing to listen to the Gospel that had inspired such love and self-sacrifice. Though M. Testevuide did not become infected with the dread disease, his years of labour for the lepers were but few. He died in 1891, but the work begun by him has been continued with similar devotion by others.

An extract from the *Japan Weekly Mail* of November 26, 1887, gives a bird's-eye view of the educational work of the Roman Catholic Mission at that time:

"The missionaries. . . are exclusively French. It is a large and powerful mission, numbering nearly sixty fathers and over forty Sisters of Chanty. Most of the staff is attached to the seminaries and convents in the capital and the outports. The rest are scattered over the country. The two parent seminaries of the Mission, which were established simultaneously at Nagasaki and Tokyo, date from the year 1872, and the Yokohama Convent School was founded in the same year. Tsukiji Convent School followed in 1874, Osaka and Kobe Convent Schools in 1877 and Nagasaki Convent School in 1880. There are also convent schools in Hakodate and Niigata, besides stations at Sendai, Morioka, Okayama, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Kochi. . . . The educational work of the Mission in its higher branches is devoted almost exclusively to the training of youths for the priesthood and does not suffer itself to he diverted into secular channels. Instruction is ever restricted to a subordinate place as the handmaid of religion. Even where a technical education is given, as at Osaka, the lads are trained to be carpenters and smiths for the service of the Church. In the convents it is somewhat different; since many girls attend these establishments merely to receive a foreign education. Great attention is paid by the sisters to sewing, crocheting, and all kinds of fancy work. Many of the pupils are enabled to pay something for their board by the sale of their handiwork; a contribution which is welcome, seeing that almost everything has to be supplied gratis to the pupils. In Protestant mission schools it is a question under debate whether pupils shall be admitted before the age of nine or ten; in these Catholic homes there are babes two months old. The orphans whom the sisters adopt are mostly placed with Christian women outside the convent who receive a small fee for their services. Some of the most difficult or delicate cases are attended to within the convent walls. The care and attention which the good sisters bestow on these wretched waifs, the diseased and unsightly offspring of poverty and sin, is beyond all praise. The Mission has no less than nine orphanages with nearly a thousand inmates."

An interesting event in 1.888 was the discovery of descendants of Ishikawa Kizaemon, one of the Twenty-six Martyrs of 1597. There were now two branches of the family; one living in Okayama and the other in a neighbouring village. The tiles on the roofs of Japanese houses are often decorated with some emblem, and in the house occupied by the Okayama branch of the family the decoration included a cross. Though the present members of the family had apparently lost all knowledge of Christian doctrines, some of them were soon afterward baptised.

In 1879, the Propaganda had established several districts between which the vicariates of China and adjacent countries had been distributed. For the promotion of unity in ecclesiastical matters it had been ordered that each district should hold synods at regular intervals. Since the conditions in Japan and Korea did not justify their inclusion in this arrangement, it was not until 1884, that these countries were set off as together forming one district. In March, 1890, the first synod was held in Nagasaki. The time was so chosen that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the discovery of the Urakami Christians occurred while the synod was in session. To increase the importance of the occasion, the Pope accorded a plenary indulgence to all Christians who should at that time make a pilgrimage to the Church of the Twenty-six Martyrs in Nagasaki, and he accorded to the bishops the power to bestow the papal benediction upon the people. The first solemn session of the synod was held on Sunday, March 2. On that day also, the pilgrimages were inaugurated by twenty-five hundred Christians from Urakami. Early in the morning six hundred of them had received the communion in their own valley and then, forming a procession, they had marched over the same road that had been trodden by many of them twenty years previously, as they went into exile. The women, as before, wore the white head-dresses received at the time of their baptism; but now, if tears were in the eyes of any, it was as a sign of joyful thankfulness, and not of grief. With banners and songs the pilgrims made their way through the streets of Nagasaki and up the flight of steps that led to the church.

Certain days had been appointed for the coming of Christians from other communities. As the ancient Jews made their way to Jerusalem at the time of the Passover, so the Japanese believers came from different parts of Kyushu. Some journeyed by land, bands of happy pilgrims rejoicing in the religious liberty that had been assured to them a year before, by the National Constitution. Dwellers on the islands came by boats, on which they lived during their stay in Nagasaki. At early dawn and in the evening, their prayers and songs could be heard floating over the placid waters of the bay. On the day assigned to a company for its visit to the church, its members gathered upon the shore and awaited the summons for climbing the hill. When the bell sounded, the missionaries in charge of the section of the country from which the pilgrims came would put themselves at the head of the procession as it made its way to the church. Often the number of those who came was too great to allow all of them to enter the building at one time. It was estimated that in all, some ten or twelve thousand Christians took part in these pilgrimages.

The great day of the feast was March 17, the anniversary of the discovery of the Christians. Throughout the commemorative service that was observed, two women remained kneeling before the tomb of Mgr. Petitjean, Twenty-five years before, this mother and daughter, the latter then but a little girl, had been in the company of visitors who had said to him whose body was now lying within that tomb: "We have the same heart as you."

In 1888, a third vicariate—that of Central Japan— had been created, and this was followed in 1891, by a fourth, comprising Yezo and the Kurile Islands, that was named the Vicariate of Hakodate. Almost immediately after this, the Pope established an episcopal hierarchy in Japan. The vicariates were replaced by three bishoprics and one archbishopric. In carrying out this arrangement, Mgr. Osouf became the Archbishop of Tokyo; Mgr. Cousin, the Bishop of Nagasaki; Mgr. Midon, the Bishop of Osaka; and Mgr. Berlioz, the Bishop of Hakodate.

At this time the prospects of rapid growth seemed bright. In Oshima there were thousands\* asking for instruction preparatory to baptism, and in a short time the rite was administered to about fifteen hundred of them. From 1880 to 1890, the "Catholic population" had grown from 23,909 to 42,378. Included in this increase were many people that had formerly been reckoned among the Separates," and this source of enlargement was from the necessity of the case becoming of less importance, so that the growth of the next five years to 50,302 was very encouraging. The effects of the reaction that retarded the advance of Protestant Christianity were not felt so quickly by Roman Catholicism. They appeared later in the slower growth of the next two five-year periods, the population in 1900 being 54,602, and that of 1905 being 59,437.

The following account, abridged from that given in 1895, by M. Marnas,\* will serve to show some of the methods by which the work was carried on:

"In each diocese there are useful auxiliaries to second the efforts of the bishops and missionaries, who without them would be unable to perform the many duties of their apostolate. Some are Japanese. These are priests, catechists, and school-teachers. In the south, eight native communities of nuns devote themselves to the religious instruction of children and to charitable efforts of the most varied forms. Other nuns have come from Europe. The Marianites, a congregation of men, including both priests and lay brothers, devoted solely to education, have established a college. The Dames of Saint-Maur, the Nuns of the Holy Child Jesus of Chauffailles, and the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres have seminaries and schools for girls, direct the orphanages of the Holy Infancy, and give themselves to labours among poor, sick, and needy persons of all kinds.

"History will not be able to bring against modern missionaries in Japan the reproach urged by Rohrbacher against those of former times that they did not pay sufficient attention to raising up a native clergy. This work, which holds the first place in the solicitude of the bishops, is in excellent condition. Up to the present time twenty-three priests have been ordained. Three of these have died: one of them by disease after a service of four and a half years, and the other two by being drowned at sea in a typhoon.

"Whoever has seen the first native priests of Japan engaged in their labours can bear of them the general witness that they are as well instructed, as pious, and as devoted to God's service as could reasonably be expected. Since 1890, as a result of an understanding between the bishops, a single seminary—that in Nagasaki—receives from all four dioceses those who by previous examinations have been judged fit persons for ecclesiastical studies.

"The studies are exacting. The pupils show much interest in them. They apply themselves closely to their work and are successful. In the lower classes they study Latin, the Japanese language, and the Chinese ideographs. In the following grades, history, geography, literature, the sciences and philosophy are added. Finally they come to the study of dogmatic theology, moral theology, and the Holy Scriptures. The entire course requires over fifteen years. In rare cases, candidates for holy orders are admitted before reaching the age of thirty. They are tested before being made sub-deacons. The rules require that they shall leave the seminary for one year and be sent into the country districts as catechists under the direction of missionaries. If any then feel appalled at thought of the irrevocable vows that every priest must make before ascending to the altar, they have the option of remaining in an inferior position. Those that persist in their desire for ordination are tested at the seminary for one more year before being allowed to take the decisive step.

"These young men are attractive in appearance. They are simple-hearted, refined, good-natured, and animated. They show the same zeal in their sports as in their studies. They have clear brows and frank faces. At the altar they are reverent and grave. They carry out the ceremonies with great perfection and chant the liturgy in a very appropriate manner. For the most part they are sons of confessors of the faith. At the time of the last persecution many of them shared the prisons of their parents, and in childhood had the honour of suffering for Jesus Christ. The children of heathen are fewest in number and belong to dioceses that have not the advantage of possessing descendants of the ancient Christians.

"The catechists, a class of helpers whose preparation is easier and quicker, have not for that reason failed to render most important service. Not only did they at first give effectual aid in the restoration of the ancient Christian communities, but they have been and still are indispensable agents for the conversion of the heathen. It is doubtless true that the work of the catechist cannot supply the place of that done by the missionary; but it supplements the latter and serves to extend its influence. It can readily be seen that a Japanese layman, who is ordinarily a mar-Tied man not distinguished from others by his dress or behaviour, can mingle much more easily with his fellow-countrymen, talk with them on matters of common interest, and gradually lead them to a religion of which he himself is already a convert. A foreign priest, especially at first, is the object of a certain amount of suspicion. Heathen have no idea of the spiritual motive that has brought him to them, and they often think that he has been led by some secret and selfish purpose.

"In Japan two methods are employed for the training of catechists. The first is that of having them study for a while in special schools. The other is to choose from the most talented and earnest members of a Christian community one or more men who are willing to serve in the desired capacity, and the missionary himself instructs these persons, furnishes them with books, replies to their own doubts or to those proposed to them by others, has them preach in public when he is present, and otherwise directs their education. While in the case of a native priest, who to a sufficiently thorough knowledge of the sacred sciences must add the practice of lofty and stern virtues, there must be a special, call well tested by means of long studies and training, a catechist, since he is not constrained to celibacy or to a particular form of life, can be prepared for effective service in a few months, especially if he has bad some previous education.

One very remarkable thing in Japan is the taste that the people have developed for public speaking Perhaps there is no country in the world where there is more of this and where the people listen so well without signs of weariness.\* The Japanese are naturally eloquent and it is not rare to find, even among men of meagre education, a real talent for extemporaneous speech. Whoever has anything to say can always find an attentive audience, All that it is necessary to do is to hang out through the day before the gate a paper lantern on which is written in Chinese ideographs a notice of the lecture; and at evening the speaker, whether he be a politician, a preacher, or a simple story-teller, finds seated on the mats before him an audience made up of people of all ages and classes, who smoke their tiny pipes and sip tea while they willingly listen until late at night to whatever may be said.

"The catechist's mission does not end here. He remembers the Chinese proverb: 'A chance word often accomplishes more than a well-prepared discourse.' All the time not given to study is devoted to interviews with the heathen and especially with the catechumens. He teaches them the holy doctrine; he prepares them for baptism; he shows an interest in children, invalids, and poor people; he takes part in the joys and sorrows of the family whose confidant and friend he becomes; and it often happens that it is by his deeds rather than by his words that he gains for God the souls of his brethren. The work of the catechist therefore completes that of the missionary. He prepares the way for the latter by winning for him the minds and hearts of men. Without him the evangelisation of the people, if not impossible, would at least be very difficult. In the midst of the Christian communities the catechist fills a different place but one no less useful. In the absence of the priests it is he that gathers the Christians for the recital of prayers, that exhorts them to remain faithful, that instructs the children, and prepares them for the reception of the sacraments.

"Women can serve as catechists for persons of their own sex. While keeping within their sphere, they often prove no less successful than the men. The communities of nuns in the Nagasaki diocese are veritable nurseries of female catechists. At the direction of the bishops these workers often go to the most distant places; for in Japan women are not shut up as they are in China, and they are often better able than men to exert a helpful influence upon families.

Important as is the part taken by catechists, they do not suffice for fully attaining the end sought by the Catholic apostolate. Schools are also needed. These are necessary for Christian children, whose faith and morals must be safeguarded. They are necessary for the heathen themselves, since the schools often furnish the only means for reaching these persons. The Japanese Government has established educational institutions of all grades. Before the movement that makes Japan to-day enthusiastic in educational matters had become so marked, the Catholic missionaries, when as yet they had no Christians, gathered many heathen pupils or accepted positions as teachers in the government schools. The institutions founded by them did not survive the persecution of 1870-73. After that outbreak few efforts were made in the same direction. Although the zeal of the missionaries was chiefly directed to the care of the Christian communities and the evangelisation of the heathen, they opened primary schools wherever their resources made this possible. These primary schools have continued to increase in number until the present day. The teachers are Japanese chosen and supported by the Mission. The pupils pursue the same studies as those of the government schools, with the single addition that the catechism is taught outside of the regular class-hours. Heathen children are usually admitted to these schools in the same way as Christian children, and it often comes to pass that they and their parents ask to become Catholics.

"In order to reach the upper classes of society the bishops appealed to the Marianites to establish colleges in the principal cities. The first members of this order, who arrived at Tokyo in 1887 under the direction of the Abbé Heinrich, were favourably recommended to the Japanese authorities by the French Minister. When permission had been obtained for opening a school in the capital, they rented a building and commenced their first term with sixty pupils. These belonged to the best families in Tokyo and Yokohama, Protestant as well as Catholic. Among them were some Japanese. In 1895 the pupils numbered one hundred and sixty, divided about equally between Japanese, Europeans, and Eurasians. In 1891 the Marianites established a second institution in Nagasaki with the intention of having it serve for a novitiate as well as for a school.

"Long before the Marianites arrived in Japan, the Dames of Saint-Maur, the Nuns of the Holy Child Jesus, and the Sisters of Saint Paul had been called for the purpose of opening girls' schools. There are in Japan no communities of nuns that do not have schools. Besides the orphanages under their care, where Christian education is given to about fifteen hundred children they have established several schools for daughters of well-to-do families. It is remarkable that after a little while most of those who come as heathen ask of their own accord to be Christians.

"Some missionaries have engaged in literary labours They have published in Japanese fifty books that treat for the most part of religious matters. Since 1880 they have conducted under various names a review which discusses important theological philosophical, historical, and scientific questions, besides giving the religious news of Japan and the Catholic world. There is also a weekly journal.\*

"If words are powerful, works are much more so. When an epidemic breaks out, when the cholera rages as it did in 1886 and 1890, missionaries, nuns, and Christian believers are to be seen carrying help to the sick in the unostentatious manner of persons that are performing the most elementary duties. In 1890 MM. Brotelande, Vigroux, and Lecomte saw their devoted labours in the hospitals of the capital rewarded by the baptism of five hundred cholera patients. In Tokyo the older orphan girls under the care of the Dames of Saint-Maur aroused the admiration of the physicians and hospital officers, who gave to these improvised nurses the recompense usually bestowed on attendants of the first class; but what was more pleasing to these orphans was the number of baptisms that they were able to administer. In 1891 and 1892, when influenza prevailed, a single Christian obtained the baptism of four hundred adults It is not only under unusual circumstances and at the lime of great epidemics that Catholic charity is manifested. Among the nuns are some that care for the sick, either visiting them in their homes or bringing them to the convent. They have pharmacies and dispensaries where every year they give remedies and help to thousands of people and where they obtain many conversions or prepare the way for them. Others have small hospitals where they receive sick people who have no other refuge and who for the most part find there the benefit of a Christian death. But the most extensive work conducted by the three sisterhoods is that done in the orphanages. Thanks to the Society of the Holy Infancy, they are bringing up in ten institutions about fifteen hundred orphan girls who find all the care that could have been given by their own parents, the affection that such parents often refuse, and beyond all this the inexpressible advantage of a Christian training and education. The nuns teach these children such industries as will give them a means of support in future days. Nearly all these young girls are Christians when they leave the orphanages. The greatest obstacle to their continuance in the faith is the difficulty of finding suitable husbands; the number of Christian young men being much less that that of Christian young women. Most of them are compelled to marry heathen, and this gives rise to many inconveniences.

"There are also orphanages for boys. Every diocese has its own, but the number of inmates is much less than that in institutions for girls. One reason, and perhaps the principal one, is that in Japanese families boys are always preferred to girls. Hitherto the young men going out from the orphanages have shown little inclination to marry the orphan girls.\*

"Infirm and friendless old people cannot fail to have a claim on Catholic charity. At Nagoya, M. Tulpin has brought together on land belonging to the Mission about forty old persons whom he lodges, either in families or singly, in detached buildings, thus leaving them at liberty and under the pleasant illusion of dwelling in their own homes. Finally, there is the work for lepers inaugurated by M. Testevuide, and since his death in 1891 continued by M. Vigroux."

At about the time described by M. Marnas, the Roman Catholic missionaries were feeling, with others, the results of the reaction against Western ideas. M. Bulet wrote: "The characteristic note of the period we are passing through is, if I am not mistaken, a real religious indifference, which is more difficult to overcome than the ancient hostility, which made martyrs." Archbishop Osouf reported: "Nearly all the missionaries complain of a want in their Christians, the absence of zeal to propagate their religion around them." One missionary wrote of a place where about thirty catechumens had "fallen away during the year, under the influence of political excitement and the revulsion of feeling against foreigners;" while another said: "This year has been the most painful of my life. To judge by the number of baptisms I have to report, one might doubt of the zeal of my five catechists. Nothing could be more unjust. St. Paul \(2 Tim. iv.\) has well described the state of my district: 'There shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine, but will turn away their hearing from the truth and will be turned unto fables.'"\*

\* This interest in public speaking of which M. Marnas writes is a matter of recent growth, and to a considerable extent it is due to Christian influence. In former times there was, of course, no public discussion of political questions, and Buddhist priests did but little preaching. Among Japan's noted men it would be hard to select any who were famous as orators. As soon as the public proclamation of Christian doctrine became possible, Protestant missionaries and afterwards the native evangelists began to preach. Those of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches did the same somewhat later to a less degree. The Buddhist priests found that in order to retain a hold upon their followers it was necessary to do more than formerly for their instruction, The advocates of popular rights soon saw the advantage of public discussion as a means for arousing the people, and so political lectures became common.

\* Father Steichen, writing in 1904, says that the Catholic Church then had 21 orphanages, where 1,378 girls and 182 boys were sheltered at an annual expense of 100,000 *yen.* He questions whether the results correspond to the expenditure. "It may be asked," he says, "whether it is really practical to confer baptism on these waifs. Some persevere, but the great number when once put back into the pagan environment forget little by little that they are Christians. In general the Japanese have not much will power, but in the environments from which come the children of our orphanages it is even impossible to give it to them. . . . This essentially Christian work is the despair of the missionaries. On the one hand they would not abandon these poor unfortunates to their sad fate and on the other hand they ask themselves whether with the same resources they might not undertake some less ungrateful work."—"The Christian Movement in Japan," II., p. 195.

### MISSIONS 1901-1909
THE MISSIONS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY   1901-1909





HOWEVER it may be to those more directly concerned with the progress of the Roman Catholic Church in Japan, its later history presents, to one outside of its communion, but few striking events. Such a person can not be greatly interested in the coming and going of individual missionaries, or even in the appointment of new bishops to take the place of those who have passed away. Year by year, whether those in attendance be many or few, the Church's services of worship are conducted in the same way; it carries on its educational and charitable institutions with some increase in their number, yet with little change in their methods; and it adds slowly though steadily to the number of its adherents; but, except that its edifices are often prominent features in the appearance of the cities where they are located, the missions are carried 011 in ways that but slightly attract the attention of the outside world. There have been, however, some events connected with the development of the Roman Catholic Church in the twentieth century that demand a place in this history.

The interests of the Church in Japan, as has been seen, were for a long time entrusted to the Société des Missions-Étrangères of Paris, and thus, nearly all of the missionaries were French. After the Spanish-American war many of the Dominicans removed from the Philippine Islands, and in 1904, the Propaganda having caused the Island of Shikoku, which then had three hundred Roman Catholic Christians and four chapels, to be given into the care of their order, six of these Spanish friars went to this field. A company of Franciscans have set-tied in Sapporo, where considerable of their time is given to the teaching of English, German, and French, probably with the hope suggested in a report of the Société des Missions-Étrangères, which says: "If the teaching of languages has as a result a students' hostel and later a real college, it may be believed that the *élite* of the next generation will be led to our holy religion."

The desire of the Jesuits to re-enter Japan has at length been granted, and in 1908, members of that Society went thither, entrusted with the task of founding an educational institution of high grade. Thus three of the orders that long ago laboured in Japan have returned to the scenes of their former triumphs and sufferings.

A company of Trappists that had come to Japan in 1896 and established a monastery near Hakodate, began, about 1901, to attract considerable attention because of accounts that were published by journalists who had visited them and been impressed by their austere method of life. At first the community had experienced great difficulties from the severity of the northern winter, from sickness and even death, from the hostility of the people among whom they settled, from unfriendly articles in the newspapers, from the interference of officials, from the destruction of one of their buildings in a typhoon, and from insufficient funds. They gradually disarmed prejudice, and by 1902, about fifty persons, children and adults, living in the neighbourhood, had been baptised by them. The products of the farm that they cultivated were of such excellent quality as to gain a ready sale, so that a report made in 1902 said that, if means for clearing more land could be found, the community might hope that after a while it could be supported by its own labour. The same report says:

"The principal object of our foundation was to introduce the religious life into Japan. In fact, we are the first and only religious order here. If it is true that it is as well worth while to make one native priest as to make a thousand Christians, how much more is this true of a religious destined for the priesthood? We have now eleven Japanese, of whom five are professed religious and six novices; three more will enter soon."\*

Near the monastery is a company of nuns belonging to the allied order of Notre Dame des Anges.

In Kyushu many descendants of the ancient Christians still hold themselves aloof from the missionaries; the Report of the Société des Missions-Étrangères for 1903, says that they are more difficult to reach than the pagans, though most of the forty-four adults baptised at Urakami the previous year were from this class. The Report for 1906 says that in Ikutsukishima—the island formerly under the rule of "Prince Anthony"—there were still six thousand of these *"séparés."*

M. Ferrand has taken much interest in the establishment of hostels for students attending higher institutions of learning. This work he began in 1899, when a small building for the purpose was obtained in Tokyo. Soon afterward another was opened in Kanazawa \(Kaga\). In these hostels the students paid for their lodgings, but, in addition to being under helpful influences, they received from the missionaries gratuitous instruction in foreign languages. Obedience to rules, such as that forbidding the inmates to be absent at night, was required. The directors learned by enquiries at the different schools whether the students were regular in their attendance and whether their conduct was good. In 1906, M. Ferrand, in writing of what had been accomplished, said of the boarders in these hostels:

"Under a gentle, paternal surveillance, a rule easy to accept, they live in an atmosphere really Christian, where they receive instruction adapted to their needs from a religious, philosophical, historical, and scientific point of view. Little by little, thanks to the lectures they follow and to private conversations, the errors and prejudices imbibed at school are disappearing; ignorance and doubts are vanishing; the true religion and its ministers are better understood and appreciated. Many souls who have remained upright come nearer to us and make the decisive step for which they are prepared; the light shines for them and it is thus that more than a hundred students have been converted and baptised

"We have also established a club of Catholic students to group together all those who are in Tokyo and through them attract the non-Catholic young men. This little society counts in all about eighty members; they meet once a month for conferences given by the missionaries and the older students. . . . For more than a year the members of the Catholic students' club have published a little monthly review of about seventy pages, called the *Shin Riso* \(New Ideal\), which treats from a Catholic point of view all serious questions which may interest the student."\*

The Japanese are very fond of theatrical representations, and in some places the missionaries have taken advantage of this fact for reaching the people by means of what bear some resemblance to the mystery plays of the Middle Ages. At one of the first exhibitions of this kind the drama was founded on the history of the Twenty-six Japanese Martyrs. A report of it says:

"The actors performed their parts with faith and true piety. From the fifteen or sixteen pagans that the building could contain not a single unpleasant word was heard. On the contrary, the pagan women wept with emotion, while the men waxed indignant over the cruelty with which the executioners treated the martyrs The effect that was produced has exceeded our hopes. Many pagans who for some years have been inclined towards Catholicism were converted."†

M. Angles, writing from Osaka, says that, as the exhibitions are conducted there, the actors are usually selected from the young men of the parish or from inmates of the orphan asylum. Among the most effective pieces are those founded on the story of Joseph and on that of the Twenty-six Martyrs. Large audiences listen with close attention, not only to the dramas, but also to the short addresses on religious themes that are introduced between the acts.

Many publications have been issued in recent years. M. Ligneul has been specially active in preparing a number of books on subjects more or less directly connected with religion. These have established for him a reputation as a scholar, and probably led to his being invited to give a series of lectures at Tokyo, before the Imperial Educational Society. He took for his subject "The Philosophy of Teaching," and the lectures were published by the society. Afterwards he delivered an other course before the students of philosophy in the Imperial University of Tokyo, upon "The Place of Philosophy in Contemporary Society."

The war with Russia probably affected the Roman Catholics less than it did the Protestants and Greeks, though they shared the work done in behalf of the soldiers and their families. The Mission's request that it be allowed to send one or more priests to care for the spiritual interests of Catholic soldiers and to engage in beneficent efforts for others, was not granted by the Government. Among the Russian prisoners brought to Japan were many Polish Catholics, and the missionaries gained permission to visit these. The Bishop of Osaka, when visiting one of the prisons, spoke to an audience of twelve hundred men of different races. At that time he confirmed three hundred and fifty Poles.\*

Of another place a missionary wrote:

"Our five hundred prisoners have all made their confessions and been communicated. We say mass for them regularly, every Sunday and nearly every Thursday, so that they are really better provided with services than they were in Russia. In the two places where mass is said for them the prisoners have fitted up proper chapels; the sergeants serve at the mass, and some of them would take rank with the most experienced servers."†

Father Steichen thus describes how the interest taken in the prisoners excited the suspicion and distrust of ultra-patriotic Japanese:

"Some of our Christians abandoned their religion because the missionary had gone to visit the Russian prisoners in order to offer his services to some Polish Catholics among them. Another reason for this abandonment of their faith was that the missionary had incurred the suspicion of being a Russian spy, because he had gone to witness the departure of troops for the front."‡

In November, 1905, Archbishop O'Connell of Maine \(afterwards of Boston\) went to Japan as a legate from the Pope to return thanks for favours that had been shown to Roman Catholics in Japan, and for protection given at the time of the war to those in Manchuria. He was given an audience by the Emperor, and at a reception tendered to him in the Y. M. C. A. Hall of Tokyo, several Protestants were among the speakers.

Roman Catholicism has been, to a greater extent than Protestantism, subject to the charge that it tends to weaken the spirit of loyalty. This is partly because of the prejudice occasioned by the events of three centuries ago, because fewer of its followers have been among those taking a prominent part in national affairs, and because of what is thought to be its attitude in some European countries. One French missionary speaks of having the objection thus thrown at him:

"Catholicism is not a religion fitted to Japan, because a Catholic is deficient in patriotism."

"What proof have you of that?"

"What proof? Why is it that Clemenceau makes war on the French Church? Is it not because French Catholics are not patriots?

Another effect of the troubles in France was that the contributions from that country to the work of missions were greatly diminished. Letters of the missionaries abound in regrets that lack of funds prevented their utilising the opportunities that were before them. They were inclined to contrast their condition in this respect with that of the Protestants, whom they supposed to be provided with immense sums. Little had been done to develop self-support in the Japanese churches. Father Steichen, writing in 1904 of the self-sacrificing spirit of the missionaries, said:

"Instead of requiring the faithful to come to their aid, whether for the maintenance of the churches or for other running expenses, as is done in all other parishes throughout the world, they deprived themselves of necessaries in order to defray the expenses themselves. So the 58,086 Catholics of Japan contribute hardly 2,000 *yen* for the maintenance of the Mission."\*

The greatly increased cost of living in Japan combined with the lessening of the contributions from France to cripple the work. The Report of the Société des Missions-Etrangères for 1906, in speaking of the reduced number of seminarists studying at Nagasaki, said that the mission, alarmed at the financial outlook, did not dare to call to the service of the Church young men, to whom after ordination it would be unable "to furnish such sustenance as is required by the canons. The mission at Nagasaki has no resources of its own, and the best Christian communities will long be incapable of undertaking the support of the native clergy that is already in existence." M. Sauret wrote, in 1905, that the cost of living had so increased that most of the missionaries had dispensed with their catechists, and he went on to say:

"This means an absolute stand-still in our missionary labours, properly speaking, as it is impossible for us Europeans to do any direct work among the pagan element of the population. To reach it we need the catechist as an intermediary; the very fact that we are foreigners is an insuperable obstacle to our being admitted in a pagan family, much less gaining its confidence."

The same letter says:

"The diocese of Nagasaki is rather behind in regard to the evangelisation of the pagans: this is due to the fact that the old Christians of St. Francis Xavier, discovered by Bishop Petitjean in 1865, are all in this part of the country. For many years the missionaries had all they could do to minister to those Christians, who numbered several thousands. Although they had kept the faith, they were very ignorant and had to be instructed and trained in the practices of religion. I was the first one to attack the pagans and not without some success. I formed a catechist to clear up the ground for me, and that man has brought to the faith a number of pagans."

After speaking of the need for a dispensary, the letter continues:

"But if we want a dispensary to do some good to the soul, we must also employ Catholic Japanese nurses. They are indispensable and would alone be able to make conversions. Sisters might have direction of the institution, but they could do no effective work for the evangelisation of the pagans. Their habit and their nationality would always stand in their way. The Japanese keep strangers at a distance. In their heart of hearts they despise them more or less, though exteriorly they preserve a respectful silence. There is no possible intimate association under such conditions and consequently the heart is not won over and it is difficult to effect a sincere conversion. In dispensaries and in hospitals a Japanese woman could do a great deal of good. A sick man or woman would speak to her with sincerity and would not hesitate to ask her about the character, life, and religion of the foreigners at the head of the dispensary. From admiration it will be easy for them to pass to imitation. The patients would not dare to ask similar questions of the Sisters; and, even if they did, they would not pay much heed to the answers; in their opinion all foreigners must have a motive of human interest for coming to Japan and it must be for their advantage to keep it concealed. With-such a feeling of distrust, no mutual confidence can be established. After they are once converted, the men will speak frankly to me of their disposition before baptism. Nurses, therefore, will not only do good at the dispensaries, but they will dispose men to study the Christian doctrines by visiting them in their homes. . . . Moreover, if a child is dying in the neighbourhood, it can be baptised unknown to the parents. My woman catechist baptises a number of pagan children every year in this way. Every one knows that she is in my employ, and as I have the reputation of being a good medical doctor, the people imagine that, by being associated with me, she has learned to take care of the sick. She can present herself anywhere where there are sick children. As she has a weakness for finding fever and always discovers microbes in a dirty skin, she, of course, needs water to lower the temperature or bathe the parts affected by the microbes. Whilst the pagans admire so much scientific knowledge in a Japanese woman, she profits by the occasion to administer the Sacrament of Baptism, making use of the Latin formula. The unknown language sounds rather strange to pagan ears; they imagine her words to be some kind of incantation to add efficacy to the remedies."\*

Imperial recognition of Christian philanthropy was shown, about this time, by the conferring of the Blue Ribbon on M. Bertrand and Sister Marie Colombe, for what they have done among lepers, and on M. Corre for his works of charity. This honour is bestowed on persons that have performed noteworthy deeds of public utility. On M. Vernier, who has been engaged in education, was conferred the decoration of the Order of the Sacred Treasure.

Perhaps the most successful enterprises under Roman Catholic auspices have been the schools of the Marianites. The first of these, as has already been mentioned, was established at Tokyo in 1887. Up to 1906, Japanese and European boys were educated together; but, as it was found advisable to make a division, the latter, with most of the Eurasians, were then sent to a new school that was opened in Yokohama. The next year it had 130 pupils, representing sixteen or eighteen different nationalities. Statistics of the Tokyo school for 1907 show that it was attended by 685 Japanese, 17 Chinese and Koreans, and 8 Eurasians. The enumeration by religions shows "Catholics, 71; Catechumens, 29; Pagans, 610." That it was reaching the upper classes of society is shown by its having thirty pupils from families belonging to either the old or new nobility of Japan. There were twenty-eight sons of generals or admirals; while others were sons of ambassadors, ministers of state, consuls, judges, members of the Diet, etc. Two of the Marianites were professors in the Imperial University, one taught in the Nobles' School, and two in military schools. The order also had a school at Nagasaki with 388 pupils, another \(begun in 1906\) at Kumamoto, and a commercial school at Osaka with about 600 students. The account from which these figures are taken, says that an "Apostolic School" had just been opened at Urakami, and already had more than thirty pupils. "It will have for its end the recruiting of religious, whether priests or not, who will devote themselves to teaching. If some prove unfitted for religious lives, they will be employed as free teachers, and thus, while living in the world, will be able to render valuable service."\*

One difficulty attending missionary work at this period was probably felt in a greater degree by the Roman Catholics than by the Protestants. It was that which came from the changes in population. The young people were moving from the country into the manufacturing and commercial centres. Coming into new and sometimes unfavourable surroundings they were tempted to conceal their religion or to grow weak in the faith. After the war with Russia, many Japanese removed to Korea and Manchuria, where the chances of their being in helpful religious surroundings were small. The Report of the Société des Missions-Etrangères for 1907, makes frequent mention of the weakening of small communities of Christians by such removals.

The Report of the same society for 1906, in explaining the reason for slow progress, mentions, besides other things to which reference has already been made, the fact that the Catholic doctrine rests upon the principle of authority, and says: "This principle our Japanese would perhaps admit if the seat of that authority were Japan; but their national pride opposes itself to permitting that a foreigner should, apart from the Emperor, have control over them."

What has been accomplished in the half century since Japan has been re-opened to the missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church, so far as this can be told by figures, is shown by the following statistics for 1908, taken from the Annual Report of the Société des Missions-Étrangères \(Paris. 1909\):

PART II

THE GREEK ORTHODOX MISSION





### THE BEGINNING OF THE MISSION   1861-1872





JAPAN'S nearest neighbour is Russia. For a long time subjects of each nation had settlements in Saghalien, and the resulting disputes over territorial rights continued until 1875, when Japan waived its claims to that island, and at the same time received the islands of the Kurile group that had hitherto belonged to Russia. The Kuriles had been visited in the eighteenth century by Russian priests, and not long ago there were still living on one of the islands about a dozen families of Christian Ainu, the descendants of those that had been taught by these missionaries. It is said that some of the priests penetrated into Yezo.\*

There was a professorship of the Japanese language in a school that was established by Catherine II. in Irkutsk It was filled by Japanese who had been shipwrecked on the coast of Siberia. When Klaproth was sent in 1805, as interpreter of an attempted embassy to China he remained for a while in Irkutsk, where, among other things, he studied Japanese at this school. The occupant of the professorial chair at that time had become a member of the Greek Church.

In 1854, the Chaplain of the Russian ship *Diana* then anchored at Shimoda, was one day walking on the shore when a Japanese, whose attention had been attracted by the cross on the priest's breast, asked to be taken on board the ship, and there, when secure from the observation of any of his countrymen, he drew from beneath his robe a cross, repeated the names of Jesus and Mary, and said that he was a descendant of Roman Catholic Christians. He was taken to Siberia, where he probably joined the Russian Church.\*

M. Mermet, the French missionary who visited Hakodate in 1861, was vexed at the growing influence of the Russians. In one of his letters he wrote that their houses and shops were springing up on all sides, as though by magic, that Russian men-of-war were numerous in the harbour, and that "an army of popes," having large sums of money at their command, was spreading over the country. These popes, he said, were very zealous and by their benefactions were purchasing the good will of the people.† The Frenchman's zeal for his own church and his desire to arouse the emulation of his supporters must have led him to an exaggerated view of the activity of the Russians. It may be doubted whether his army of popes equalled in number that of the band that set upon the doughty Falstaff; certainly, there seems little reason to believe that, with a single exception, any Russian priests connected with the navy or the consular service were deeply imbued with a missionary spirit.

A Russian consulate had been established at Hakodate in 1859. The priest that served as Consular Chaplain had been there less than a year when poor health compelled him to withdraw. The Holy Synod, when called upon to appoint his successor, asked the authorities in the St. Petersburg Ecclesiastical Academy to find a suitable person. The one chosen was Ivan Kasatkin, a young man twenty-four years old, of deep faith and fervent piety, who had been earnestly praying that God would show him the work he ought to undertake. Before this, he had become deeply interested in Japan through reading Golownin's account of his captivity in that land. Moreover, he longed to preach the Gospel to those that had not yet heard it. Hence, the position of Consular Chaplain at Hakodate was attractive, as it might possibly open the way for him to carry out his desires.

He was soon ordained to the priesthood, taking at that time the name of Nicolai, by which he has since become so well known. In July, 1860, he left St. Petersburg and with only two days' delay at his home, pushed on through Russia and Siberia until, at the end of September, he reached the town of Nicolaievsk at the mouth of the Amur River. Since it was too late to get a boat to Japan, he remained in that place through the winter. His missionary zeal was strengthened by intercourse with Bishop Innocent, who was seeking to convert the tribes of eastern Siberia.

When spring came, Père\* Nicolai proceeded on his journey and reached Hakodate in June, 1861. His duties in connection with the consulate were so light that he had abundant time for studying the Japanese language. Among the teachers that he employed was Joseph Neesima, who, after being with him about a month told him of Ins purpose to leave Japan, and asked his assistance in carrying it out. Père Nicolai warned him of the danger and offered to teach him English; but on returning from a summer vacation, the Chaplain found that the young man, in whose care he had left the house was no longer to be found in Hakodate.

Another person who was engaged as a teacher failed to appear at the appointed time, and when Père Nicolai sent to enquire the reason he said: "Please excuse me-for if I go to your house, I shall be killed." Père Nicolai afterwards thought that some young men who were studying Russian had frightened away the teacher, so that more time might be devoted to them.

A *samurai* by the name of Sawabe, who was a native of Tosa in the island of Shikoku, had come to Hakodate and there married the daughter of a Shinto priest After the death of his father-in-law, he succeeded to the care of the shrine. He did not take much pleasure in the duties of the priesthood and, like so many others of the military class, his thoughts were much occupied with the political questions of the time. Hakodate had become a rendezvous of the *ronin—*military men who had detached themselves from the service of their feudal lords, and who were restlessly agitating various plans for advancing what they considered the interests of their country. Many of them had adopted the watchword *"Bono joi"* \("Honour the Emperor; drive out the foreigners"\). They were waiting some favourable opportunity for action. Sawabe was on intimate terms with many of these men.

The Russian Consul wished his son to take lessons in fencing, and Mr. Sawabe, who had formerly been a teacher of that art, was employed for an instructor. In his visits to the consulate he often saw Père Nicolai, whom he regarded with special dislike as being not only a foreigner, but also a priest of the European religion. For a long time he refused to have any conversation with the Chaplain, though he took every opportunity to show his aversion by scowling upon him. Believing that the danger of intercourse with foreign lands came largely from their religion, he, as an ardent patriot, desired to do what he could towards warding off the threatened evil. He decided to have a discussion with Père Nicolai and to slay him if it proved impossible to defeat him by argument. Wearing the two swords belonging to the military class, he one day broke abruptly into the Chaplain's room, calling out in an angry voice:

"Is it because you wish to get possession of our country that you have brought hither your corrupt doctrines?"

"Are you acquainted with the doctrines that I teach?" quietly asked Père Nicolai.

"I at least know that they are evil."

"How can you be sure of that? Before making such an assertion, ought you not to examine my religion to see whether or not it is so hateful as you suppose?"

"Well, then, tell me about it and I will listen."

Père Nicolai therefore began to speak about the Creator of the universe. Gradually Mr. Sawabe became so interested that anger gave way to respectful attention. After a time he began to jot down notes of the principal points. At the close of the conversation he asked that he might come again for further instruction. This was the beginning of earnest study that finally led Mr. Sawabe to the conviction that Christianity is true. He did not conceal from his old friends the change that had come in his views. They were amazed that one who had been prominent in advocating the expulsion of foreigners had become a believer in their religion. Some of them thought he had become insane.

Among the friends to whom Sawabe told his new faith was a physician named Sakai, an upright man who had the reputation of standing firmly by whatever he believed to be true. He brought forward many objections against Christianity, some of them being such as Mr. Sawabe was unable to refute. He was therefore in the habit of repeating them to Père Nicolai, who supplied him with answers to carry back to his friend. Finally Dr. Sakai became sufficiently interested to go himself to the Chaplain for instruction. A third inquirer was a man named Urano.

There were rumours that a new official that had been sent to Hakodate was about to enforce the old laws and punish as rebels those persons that had anything to do with Christianity. This frightened some of those who had hitherto been ready to listen to what Mr. Sawabe toId them. Some went so far as to cut off all social relations with him and Dr. Sakai. They would probably have been ready to give information against their former friends. Mr. Sawabe had most reason, however, to fear his mother-in-law. She was bitterly opposed to Christianity, and would not have hesitated to betray him to officials searching out followers of that religion.

Sawabe, Sakai, and Urano, following the advice of friends, decided to seek safety by flight to some place where they were not known. They earnestly desired to receive baptism before leaving Hakodate. On an April night in 1868 they slunk through the streets to the house occupied by Père Nicolai, where all the preparations had been made for the ceremony. A young Russian, who was accustomed to act as reader in the consular chapel, was stationed on the stairway to guard against intrusion, while within a dimly lighted room the rite was administered. Following the custom of the Greek Church, the three men received Christian names, and were henceforth to be known as Paul Sawabe, John Sakai, and Jacob Urano.

At the close of the ceremony, Père Nicolai bade farewell to these men, the first fruits of his missionary labours. It was doubtful whether he would ever look upon their faces again. They as yet knew but little of Christian truth. They greatly needed the instruction that it would be impossible for him to give. He was indeed sending them forth as sheep—nay, as new-born lambs-—into the midst of wolves.

The three men went out into the darkness and made their way to the house of a friend by whose aid passage had been secured on a junk that was about to sail. Joined by Dr. Sakai's wife and daughter and by Mr. Sawabe's serving-man, they were soon on board; but the wind and waves were so high that the captain did not dare to set sail. For a whole day they remained in the harbour, apprehensive lest their absence would cause a search to be made for them. The next day they started. Hardly had they cleared the harbour when the violence of the sea made it impossible to proceed. The ship put back to port. Dr. Sakai with his wife and daughter went to the house of a friend who had helped them to escape, and there lay concealed in the attic. The others found refuge elsewhere. On the fourth day they again set forth and after three days at sea reached a port in the northern part of Hondo.

As it was thought safer to divide into two bands, Dr. Sakai with his family at once set out toward his native town in the province of Rikuzen. Mr. Sawabe's servant, who was an intemperate man, gave so much trouble that it was found necessary to discharge him. Mr. Sawabe decided that Yedo would be the safest refuge for himself; and as Mr. Urano's home was in Rikuzen, the two travelled thus far in company and then separated.

At this time the country was in a troubled state, the northern daimyos, who sided with the Shogun, being in arms against the Imperial forces that had been sent to compel their submission. The Tosa clan, to which it will be remembered that Mr. Sawabe belonged, had taken a leading part in the overthrowal of the Shogunate. It is not strange that, being betrayed by his dialect, he was soon arrested on suspicion of being a spy. Fortunately he was able to obtain release by presenting satisfactory proof that he had come from Hakodate. Soon afterwards he reached the home of Dr. Sakai, who gladly welcomed his friend and fellow-believer. The house, however, was small and not well fitted for concealing a stranger, whose presence was likely to give rise to unpleasant enquiries; therefore, Mr. Sawabe was sent to Mrs. Sakai's parents in a neighbouring village. They at first received him kindly; but when it became known that he and Dr. Sakai were Christians, the family feared that they would be punished for giving shelter to a follower of the proscribed religion. The relatives had several consultations over the matter, and though they did not openly refuse to keep Mr. Sawabe, there were various indications that he was no longer a welcome guest. Among other gentle hints, they frequently discharged muskets before the house, saying that they were trying to frighten away evil spirits. Mr. Sawabe, being well aware of what they had in mind, was unwilling to cause them annoyance, and soon decided that it would be better for him to move on towards Yedo.

He had not gone far when he was again arrested as a spy. The officers that examined him differed among themselves as to whether his story about coming from Hakodate ought to be believed. They finally decided that in any case the best plan would be to send him to the city from which he professed to come. He was therefore sent under escort to the northern boundary of the province and there left to pursue his own way. As all places seemed dangerous and the direct road to Yedo was not open to him, he decided that he might as well obey orders by returning to Hakodate. Before landing there he heard that such a strict search was being made for all persons that had any connection with Christianity that it would be perilous to go to his own house, and difficult to find a safe retreat anywhere in the city. He sent some one to call his wife, and then with her and his child went to the house of her uncle, a petty official living in a village not far away. The fact that this official was giving shelter to the refugees probably became known to his superiors, for he was soon summoned to the office, where his attention was called to the regulation by which any person who concealed a Christian became Hable to severe punishment. He did not like to send away his relatives, but Mrs. Sawabe happened to learn what had happened and told her husband, whose unwillingness to have others suffer on his account made him decide to return to Hakodate. There he called on Père Nicolai who, in surprise at seeing him, asked why he was so rash as to venture into the very jaws of the tiger that was waiting to destroy him.

"There is no place," said Mr. Sawabe, "where I am safe. After seeking various refuges, I have been forced to return to Hakodate. Here everybody knows me and it will be useless to hide. I shall simply go on my way to meet whatever may be God's will."

At this time the remnants of the Shogun's army were gathering at Hakodate, where it was said they planned to make the last stand. The city was in confusion and the excitement over military and political matters prevented the paying any attention to the enforcement of the laws against Christianity, Mr. Sawabe was therefore left undisturbed.

Père Nicolai saw reasons for believing that the time was near at hand when it would be possible to engage in active evangelistic efforts. He was teaching Russian to some of the officials, and when he occasionally referred to Christianity, he saw no indication that they wished to evade the subject. Conversations that he held with *samurai* coming from different parts of Japan showed that a great revolution was taking place in the thoughts of the people. The movement in favour of adopting Western civilisation had begun and some people were saying that there must be a new religion, since Buddhism was losing its influence and the attempt to revive Shinto was not arousing much enthusiasm. It would be impossible for a consular chaplain, working as an individual and having no resources beyond his own salary, to utilise properly the great opportunity that was close at hand. He therefore sent to Russia asking for a furlough, during which he could appeal to the Holy Synod and to his friends for help. Having thought much about the way in which missionary work ought to be conducted, he had already prepared a set of rules for a society of evangelists that he hoped sometime to organise. These rules are interesting as showing his early recognition of the importance of making converts work for the salvation of others, and also because the plan here marked out is in the main the same that was afterwards used with good results.

RULES

"The evangelists shall be organised as a deliberative body.

"These evangelists shall teach Christian truth to other people while still continuing to study it for themselves.

"There shall be two kinds of meetings. In the first the evangelists, together with others who know the essential doctrines but desire further study, shall meet to read and explain the blew Testament. Such meetings shall be held twice a week the evangelists taking turns in conducting them. None of the number should fail to attend; if any person is unavoidably prevented from coming, he ought before the next meeting to learn from some one else what was said. The second meeting is for the benefit of those—whether men, women, or children—who are commencing to study Christian doctrines. The evangelists shall explain to them the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. This meeting shall be held twice a week. The evangelists shall divide the people into classes for instruction. If for any reason a person is not present at a meeting, the evangelist shall ask some one of the absentee's family to inform him of what was said or shall go himself to the person's house for that purpose.

"In neither kind of meeting shall there be discussion until after the explanation is finished, although the meaning may be asked of anything that has not been understood

"Besides conducting the two kinds of meetings already mentioned, the evangelists shall go about the city every day trying to win new enquirers. If among those interested are persons unable to attend the meetings, \(he evangelists shall go to their houses in order to explain the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. This is to be regarded as of prime importance and should be done even if, for lack of time, the evangelist is obliged to omit the meeting for reading the New Testament.

"When persons have thoroughly learned the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and are established in the faith, they shall be presented to the priest for baptism.

"Whenever any point of doctrine is not understood, it shall be brought to the priest for explanation, and, if it is a matter of importance, the explanation shall be written down in a notebook.

"On Sundays the Association of Evangelists shall meet at the house of the priest to report what has been done during the previous week, as well as to consult together and decide on what shall be done in the week to come. These decisions shall be recorded by the evangelists in their notebooks.

"A record shall be kept of baptisms, births, marriages and deaths.

"A book for recording receipts and expenditures shall be prepared and put in the care of a person to be chosen by the Association.

"The money first collected shall be used for the propagation of Christianity.

"When sufficient money has been gathered, a young man shall be taught the Russian language and sent to a theological school in Russia. On the completion of his education, he shall return to Japan and there establish a school for teaching Christian doctrine and the sciences. He shall also translate religious books Another young man shall be sent to a medical school in Russia and on completing his studies shall return to found a hospital and a medical school.

"When the number of baptised believers reaches five hundred, one of the evangelists shall be chosen for sending to Russia that he may be ordained to the priesthood. Afterwards, one person shall be ordained for every additional five hundred converts. When there are five thousand believers, a request shall be made for the appointment of a bishop.

"The evangelists who go to teach Christianity in the different provinces shall strictly observe the above rules."

While Père Nicolai was awaiting the reply to his request for a furlough, Mr. Sawabe brought him two men whom he was trying to interest in Christianity. One of them was Mr. Kannari, who afterwards became a prominent evangelist. The second, named Arai, though only a youth, had the reputation or being a talented scholar. Both were deeply impressed by what they heard, and until Père Nicolai's departure for Russia they frequently came for further instruction.

These new enquirers were taking an active part in the political movements of the time. With others of the Sendai clan, to which they belonged, they favoured an attempt that was being made to rally the adherents of the Shogun and establish a republic in Yezo. Seeing that their numbers were insufficient for the impending conflict with the Imperial forces, they returned in April, 1869, to their province in the hope of getting others to join them. They found Sendai occupied by the Imperial troops and such a sharp watch being kept that they were obliged to remain in concealment. In conversation with those whom they met clandestinely they repeated what they had learned about Christianity.

As education had been highly valued by the Sendai clan, it possessed many men of superior ability. They were now, however, regarded as rebels. A few of the more prominent were put to death and the others had no opportunity of using their talents in the direct service of their country. Many of them became farmers or else went into retirement while they watched the course of events and hoped for better times. It was among such men that Mr. Arai found persons ready to hear about a religion whose nature they did not clearly understand but which seemed to offer a ray of hope for their own future and for that of their country, which they considered to be in a deplorable condition. The speedy defeat of the rebels in Yezo overthrew the plans of those opposed to the new order of things. Might not the Christian religion be used as a means for averting some of the evils that threatened the land?

In January, 1870, Mr. Arai went again to Hakodate. Père Nicolai was in Russia; but Mr. Sawabe heard with joy that the *samurai* of Sendai were ready to listen to Christianity. It seemed to him that by their help a movement could be commenced for the spiritual and political renovation of Japan. He therefore had Mr. Arai write a letter in which these men were urged to come to Hakodate for the study of Christianity. The reasons presented were chiefly political; the argument used being that the new religion would be the best instrument for uniting the hearts of men who, discontented with the present trend of national affairs, were working for the good of their country. With Mr. Sawabe himself at this time, patriotic motives were probably more powerful than those that were directly religious.

Several of Mr. Arai's friends decided to heed the call. Some of them thought that a movement could be inaugurated that would restore the clan to its former position of influence, others agreed with Mr. Sawabe's view that a new religion would provide a bond of national unity, and some had the idea that by association with the foreign priest in Hakodate a way might open for their going to Europe. The writer of the Japanese history of the Mission compares these men to those who at first followed Christ because they thought He would free Judea from the Roman yoke, hut who afterwards learned to know His real mission and became the pillars of the early Church.

Those who decided to go to Hakodate sold their goods, bade farewell to their friends, and set out in two or three small companies. They had somewhat misunderstood Mr. Arai's letter. It had not, as they supposed, urged them to come at once. When the first party, consisting of three men, reached their destination, they learned to their surprise that Père Nicolai, who was to be their teacher, was not in Japan. On going to Mr. Sawabe's house, they found that he was temporarily absent, and, moreover, that, instead of being, as they had supposed, a wealthy man able to become their patron, he had hard work to provide for his own support. Mrs. Sawabe sent a messenger to call Mr. Arai, who was surprised to learn that his friends had come so promptly. Until late at night he talked with them about what should be done, and answered their questions concerning Christianity; for during his own stay in Hakodate he had gained from Mr. Sawabe considerably more knowledge than he had possessed when talking with the same men a few months before. He also had a small manual of doctrine which he read and explained. The next day this instruction was continued. The new-comers soon saw that Christianity was much different from what they had supposed, and some of the doctrines they found difficult to understand. There was some talk among them about the advisability of returning to Sendai; but they thought they would be ridiculed by their friends if they returned so soon, and so they decided to remain long enough to give Christianity a thorough examination.

The Japanese historian remarks that if these men had found Mr. Sawabe in flourishing circumstances and had immediately met Père Nicolai, it is probable that they would have been unable to see anything save in the light of the motives that had brought them to Hakodate, and thus their selfish purposes would have been so strengthened as to blind their eyes to the truth. Disappointed as they were, they were now willing to listen humbly to what was taught them by Mr. Arai and by Mr. Sawabe, who soon returned home. Ere long they became deeply interested in their study of Christianity. Before this, Mr. Sawabe and Dr. Sakai had come into possession of a Chinese translation of the New Testament. This they had divided into two parts, each taking one. The men from Sendai spent much time in making copies of the half that Mr. Sawabe possessed.

Meanwhile four others were journeying towards Hakodate. On their way they passed through the village where one of their friends named Kageta was in hiding. Being one of the prominent *samurai* of the clan, he was in special danger of being punished as a rebel. On going to the house where he was supposed to be, they were told that he was not there. They had not proceeded far on their way when a messenger came running after them to say that Mr. Kageta was really in the house and desired to see them. They turned back and after some persuasion induced him to go with them to Hakodate.

These new additions to the company were heartily welcomed by Mr. Sawabe. His house had been burned a short time before, so that he was living in a shed on the grounds connected with the shrine where he had once served as a priest. Though everything was in a confused state, there was considerable room in the building, and he gladly gave shelter to all of the men from Sendai except two who found lodging elsewhere.

Mr. Sawabe is described as having been at this time a rough, fierce-looking man, who from his outward appearance might have been taken for one of the bloodthirsty swashbucklers whose riotous conduct gave so much annoyance in the troublous times of revolution. He looked like a man who in argument would never rest until he had completely silenced his opponent. His heart, however, had already been so softened by Christianity that his words and acts were gentle. He was particularly careful not to do anything that could offend these new friends. As they were well-educated men, they asked many questions that he found it difficult to answer. Hitherto he had despised learning, considering it a sign of effeminacy to spend much time over books. Now he mourned over the difficulty he had in understanding the meaning of his Chinese Testament. He saw that he needed to study if he did not wish to be put to shame, and he recognised that his lack of literary culture would greatly limit his usefulness. Hence he set himself to studying the Chinese classics, and also borrowed books on various subjects in order that by their perusal he might remedy some of his defects.

Of all the men from Sendai, Mr. Kageta was the least ready to give assent to the new teaching. While the others busied themselves in copying the Bible, he said that he would not take the trouble to do so until he had found out whether its doctrines were true or false. When some of his companions who thought they were making great progress attempted to argue with him, he would meet them with a few simple, but keen questions that sufficed to show them how little they really understood the subjects under discussion.

It would be instructive if we had a record of what was said in this interesting class whose very teachers had so slight knowledge of the doctrines they taught, doctrines so different from anything these men had before believed. One day, for instance, a discussion arose over Christ's words, "Love your enemies." Did this mean that revenge should not be visited upon the enemies of one's feudal lord? Some one asserted that it could mean nothing less. Then there was great excitement. These men had from childhood been taught the Confucian precept, "Live not under the same sky with the murderer of thy lord or father." They said that they could not accept the new teaching which was so contrary to the fundamental principles of loyalty and filial duty. It would he a shame even to sit in the same room with a person that could approve such a doctrine. When one of their number, who had at first kept silent, ventured to say that this new idea ought not to be set aside so lightly without due consideration, the others glared at him as though he too were one with whom they ought not to live under the same sky.

Mr. Ono, the man who had thus spoken, had from the beginning been very susceptible to Christian ideas. Even with such imperfect teaching, he had become convinced that the fundamental doctrines of Christianity were true, and he had become desirous of teaching them to others. He had been very earnest in trying to convince Mr. Kageta, who came to Hakodate later than he, of the existence of God. To the latter this teaching seemed at first the height of folly, and he could not understand how an educated person like Mr. Ono could hold such silly views.

After a time the funds of these men ran low. Messrs. Ono and Arai therefore returned to Sendai, hoping to get some help for the support of the company and also to interest others in the new thoughts they had received.\*

The others also began to talk about the necessity of returning. Mr. Sawabe was anxious to detain them until Père Nicolai should reach Japan. In providing for their support he went so far as to sell his sword, a great sacrifice for a *samurai* to make. At last he proposed, for he was still imbued with the old ideas of his people, to sell his wife in order to gain funds for the same purpose. The others would not consent to this, and all but two of them went back to their homes. They were so far convinced of the truth of what they had heard that they began to teach it to their relatives and other friends. As a pardon was extended about this time to the hitherto proscribed members of the clan, Mr. Kageta was at liberty to go wherever he pleased. He had become an earnest believer, and he now openly collected people together that he might read and explain to them the manual of Christian doctrine.

The two men that remained in Hakodate were still troubled for means of living. They opened small shops and succeeded fairly well in business; much better than Mr. Sawabe, who commenced to brew and sell rice-beer, but whose manners were not such as to attract custom.

When Père Nicolai arrived in Russia, the Holy Synod was considering the establishment of a bishopric in Pekin, and the Metropolitan asked him to be its head. He replied that he had no desire to be a bishop, and that he was too much interested in Japan to leave it for another country. The Holy Synod now approved of his plans and many persons promised financial support. The largest single subscription was ten thousand rubles brought to him by a merchant of Moscow who, when asked his name, refused to give it and said, "God knows." Père Nicolai was raised to the rank of Archimandrite. It was at first hoped that four priests might be sent to reside in Yedo, Hakodate, Nagasaki, and some other city to be chosen later. One priest did indeed accompany Père Nicolai on his return; but he fell ill on the journey and was obliged to go back to Russia only two months after reaching Japan.

Père Nicolai reached Hakodate in February, 1871. He soon sent a letter to Sendai in which those who had become interested in Christianity were invited to come to him for further instruction. He also asked that they bring with them some scholar well versed in Chinese, who could help him in the translation of books. The recipients of the letter, who had been eagerly waiting to hear of his return, at once prepared to follow his words. They found a Confucian scholar to accompany them and soon all were on their way to Hakodate. On their arrival they were lodged in a building connected with the consulate and were formed into a sort of school. The Archimandrite not only instructed them in Christian doctrines, but also taught the Russian language to those desiring it. At the same time he worked upon an adaptation of the Chinese New Testament to the needs of the Japanese. The school was soon increased by the coming of more persons from Sendai, and by the reception of others in Hakodate who wished to study Russian.

While Père Nicolai had been absent Dr. Sakai had come again to Hakodate, where he soon gained an extensive medical practice. Although the company of enquirers in Mr. Sawabe's house received help from members of the Sendai clan who had no interest in Christianity, Dr. Sakai seemed indifferent to their needs. Mr. Sawabe and the others were indignant at what they considered his stinginess. Some of the younger men went so far as to force their way into his house and show by their rough behaviour how much they disapproved of his conduct. Whatever may have been the reason for his indifference, he afterwards showed that he was not miserly, for soon after the coming of the Archimandrite, Dr. Sakai brought to him a large package of silver coins, saying he had been saving this money in order that it might be used in the service of the Church. Père Nicolai, while commending the zeal thus displayed, told him that perhaps the money would have been more acceptable to the Lord if it had been used for helping the brethren in their time of need.

At about this time Dr. Sakai and another man disappeared. For several days no trace of them could be found by their anxious friends. At last they came to Père Nicolai, pale and emaciated, as though they had passed through a severe illness. They said that, being possessed by the desire to become preachers of the Gospel, they had hidden themselves in an attic where they had spent the time in fasting and prayer, beseeching God to accept them for His service. The Archimandrite was pleased with their earnestness, though he told them that any person desiring to practise religious austerities ought first to seek the advice of a priest so as to do all in accordance with ecclesiastical rules.

Soon after Père Nicolai's arrival, but before the Sendai students reached Hakodate, Mr. Sawabe left that city for a short visit to Tosa, his native province. While on the journey he tried to learn what he could concerning the trend of public thought, and he was convinced that conditions were becoming favourable for an active propagation of Christianity, This made him enthusiastic in urging the immediate and vigorous prosecution of the work. On coming back to Hakodate, he was displeased to find that most of the men from Sendai were learning the Russian language instead of giving their whole time to the study of religious truth. "Is this the time," he remonstrated, "to be learning a foreign tongue? You should be preparing to go out as evangelists at the earliest possible moment." In this view he was seconded by Mr. Kageta, who had not entered the classes in Russian.

Mr. Sawabe urged Père Nicolai to remove to Tokyo, saying that Hakodate was too far removed from the center of influence and activity to be a favourable place for inaugurating any movement that was to affect the whole nation. Père Nicolai agreed with this opinion, though he felt it necessary to remain a few months longer where he was. He had an abundance of work. Besides the students who lived at the consulate, he had several other pupils in the Russian language. The superintendence of the work of the translator took much time. With the aid of the students he used a lithographic press for printing copies of the Lord's Prayer and of doctrinal manuals. He prepared a Russo-Japanese dictionary, which his pupils copied by hand. The dictionary continued to be reproduced in this way until 1881, when it gave way to one published by the Educational Department.

Near the close of 1871 several of the men from Sendai were baptised. Soon after this Père Nicolai asked one of them, John Ono, if he would be willing to return to his native province as an evangelist. Mr. Ono replied that the proposition accorded with his earnest desires. Being further asked whom he would like for associates, he chose Peter Sasakawa and Jacob Takaya. The Archimandrite therefore began to give the three young men special instruction in Christian doctrine and evangelistic methods. In November they set forth on their mission. No definite arrangement was made for their support. They had no desire to receive financial assistance from others, but expected on reaching Sendai to provide their own sustenance.

Soon after this, Mr. Sawabe was sent to Tokyo to make arrangements for the removal of Père Nicolai to that city. On his arrival he found lodgings near Nihonbashi, the very centre of the metropolis, and set himself to studying the state of affairs. There were all sorts of rumours concerning the attitude the Government was about to assume towards Christianity. Some said that the old edicts were soon to be removed. Already two scholars of growing influence, Nakamura Masanao and Fukuzawa Yukichi, had expressed sentiments in favour of religious liberty, and others were approving their views. Mr. Sawabe met some high officials of his acquaintance who expressed their willingness to have Christianity taught. He believed that, whatever the real sentiment of the Government might be, the favourable time for evangelistic efforts had come and that, since American and French missionaries were already in Yokohama and Tokyo, the Greek Church ought at the earliest possible moment to enter a field that to the enthusiastic pioneer seemed full of promise. He was living at this time with some friends belonging to his own clan, who invited him to join them in a business enterprise that they were sure would make them rich. He refused, saying, "Money-making is all very well in its way; but I have some business of far greater importance. I have consecrated myself to God for the work of preaching the Gospel." In December, when Mr, Ono came on private business to Tokyo, Mr. Sawabe thought that his friend was the one best fitted to prepare the way for Père Nicolai, and he therefore insisted on an exchange of places by which he himself was transferred to Sendai.

On the coming of Père Anatolius, another Russian priest, to Hakodate, Père Nicolai gave the work there into his care, and in January, 1872, set out for Tokyo. When he arrived in Yokohama he sent a messenger to call Mr. Ono, who reached him the next day. After consultation about various matters, Père Nicolai said: "I shall go to-morrow to Tokyo, so you must return at once." Mr, Ono reached Tokyo in the middle of the night and the next morning waited upon Soejima, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom he told of Père Nicolai's intention to reside in the city.

In Tokyo Père Nicolai at first went to a hotel that had been opened on the Foreign Concession. As this was too expensive, he accepted the use of a room that an American offered to let him have until he should be able to find a house. He soon obtained a Japanese building that was only about twelve feet square. Thither, on Mr. Ono's invitation, came four or five persons to hear what the foreigner might have to tell them. An appointment was made for a second meeting, but on the day it was to have been held, one of the great conflagrations for which Tokyo is noted swept over that section of the city. With the exception of a few things that were thrown into the well, and two books, nothing was saved from the building. Père Nicolai now found temporary shelter with a South American until he could rent another house.

News from Sendai caused much anxiety. The three evangelists that had been sent to that city went about among relatives and friends, telling of their new faith and inviting those that wished further information to come to Mr. Ono's house. This continued to be used as the chief preaching-place even after the owner went to Tokyo. Meetings were often held also in the houses of enquirers, whose numbers rapidly increased. Soon there were each day more than a hundred hearers—men, women, and children—some of them coming from neighbouring villages.

Reports of what was going on spread through the city. It was commonly believed that the evangelists practised magic. In February one of the hearers, who was well acquainted with the prefectural officers, heard reports that the latter were beginning to think they ought to prohibit the teaching of Christianity and were preparing to make arrests. To his suggestion that the meetings be temporarily discontinued, Mr. Takaya replied:

"From the first we were well aware that the officials might interfere with our work. If at the first rumour of trouble we cease proclaiming the Gospel, when will the time ever come for making God's mercy known? It is not our business to consider whether the officials will make arrests. So long as we are left free, we shall continue our work."

On the evening of February 13, while Mr. Sawabe was preaching at the house of an enquirer, he was interrupted by a messenger who had come to tell him that several policemen were prowling about Mr. Ono's house and that one of them, disguised as a merchant, had gone to enquire for Mr, Sawabe. The evangelist went on with his meeting, and at its close returned to Mr, Ono's house. Soon three policemen entered, and after binding him took him to the prefectural office. About forty policemen had been lying in wait about the house. They probably feared that the Christians would resist them, and perhaps remembrance of stories told about the arrests of Christians two hundred and fifty years before made them fear that magic would be used for effecting an escape. As a further precaution, they had barricaded the streets by placing ladders across them. After Mr, Sawabe was taken away, they entered the house, took possession of the books, and trampled on the icons.

At the prefectural office Mr. Sawabe was asked why he was breaking the laws by teaching an evil doctrine. In reply, he tried to tell them about Christianity; but the officers cut him short, saying that he should not be so insolent as to dispute with his superiors. They took away the religious emblem hanging from his neck and committed him to jail.

Peter Sasakawa, on hearing of this arrest, said to the Christians: "When Mr. Sawabe came to Sendai, I reported him to the officials as being my guest; hence, it is a very irregular method of procedure for the police to seize him without giving me any notification. I must go to the office and make enquiries about the matter. As I cannot hope to escape arrest, it will be better for me to give myself up at once."

He did as he had said, and was put in jail. Jacob Takaya had set out to Tokyo on the day of Mr. Sawabe's arrest; but being overtaken by a messenger who told him what had happened, he returned to Sendai, spent the night in Mr. Ono's house, and the next morning was taken by the police, who were surprised that he should come back to face the danger that he knew to be threatening him.

The three evangelists were not allowed to see each other. Mr. Takaya was put in a room with several common criminals. It contained a Buddhist image, and the rules of the prison required that all should repeat prayers before it every evening; but the keepers excused him from doing this, and even allowed him to repeat aloud his Christian prayers.

Several persons who had attended the meetings were put into prison, while others were summoned to the office for examination. Their names were learned from a list in Mr. Sawabe's notebook. One hundred and fifty persons were put under the surveillance of relatives, who were made responsible for their conduct. Among those interrogated were several children, who astonished the examiners by asserting their willingness to suffer punishment for the sake of Christ.

The prison was conducted after the old methods, the supply of food being insufficient, except as it was supplemented by gifts from friends. The believers rallied to the help of their brethren. The chapel in Mr. Ono's house was appointed as the place whither contributions of food should be brought. One of the Christians had a friend among the police, who let him know beforehand, when any of the company were to be apprehended. These persons would then come to the chapel so that all the arrests might be made there. The police showed considerable clemency, and in order not to cause inconvenience to those who might be busy in collecting supplies for the prisoners, would postpone their arrest until a later day.

Intelligence of these events soon reached Père Nicolai, who was greatly troubled at thought of the danger to which the Christians were exposed. He would say to Mr. Ono:

"If we cannot devise some way of saving them, they will certainly be subjected to the severest punishment. Yon must save them. If you do not, it will be the same as though you killed them."

Mr. Ono could not bear to think of his brethren as groaning in captivity, while he remained at liberty. He said that he ought to go and share their imprisonment, or even their death, if it should come to that. Père Nicolai frowned upon such an idea, and told him that he ought to remain in. Tokyo, devising some plan for the rescue of his brethren. Mr. Ono had an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and through the agency of friends got Mr. Fukuzawa Yukichi to plead with the high officials against a persecution that would bring disgrace upon the nation. Some *samurai* from Sendai, who were in Tokyo, consulted with Dr. Verbeck, then an adviser to the Council of State, who appealed to Mr. Okuma and others connected with the Government.

When the prefectural officials presented a report of their action, the matter could not longer be disregarded by the Central Government, and though there were differences of opinion among those in authority, orders were sent to Sendai for the release of the prisoners. They were brought before the local officers that they might receive their sentence as follows:

"Although you are blameworthy for having studied the foreign religion, you are mercifully pardoned because you have repented of your fault. Take heed that you do not offend again."

On hearing this, the Christians protested that they had repented of nothing, and therefore could not assent to this statement; but the officials would not listen, and ordered them to leave the place. Those that had been under surveillance were also called to the office and told that they were pardoned, but that they must henceforth be more careful to obey the laws.

It was a happy day for the released prisoners and their friends when they met in the chapel to return thanks for their deliverance. The persecution had its natural effect in dividing the chaff from the wheat. Some of the former attendants at the meetings had denied having any interest in Christianity; others had fled from home. The real enquirers had been bold, and considered it an honour to suffer persecution. The number of hearers was for a time diminished; but those that remained were more earnest than ever. After a while, there were additions to their ranks. In 1873, there were in Sendai twenty Christian families, besides about a hundred others in which were one or more believers. In all, there were about two hundred persons who had accepted Christianity, though few of them were baptised until 1875, when Mr. Sawabe, having been ordained as a priest, administered the rite to one hundred and twenty-nine persons.

As has been already mentioned, Père Anatolius was left in charge at Hakodate. It was his purpose to make the school in the consulate a place for the training of evangelists. Calling together the Christians, he asked them to select persons who should at once enter upon the work of spreading the Gospel, The choice fell upon Matthew Kageta, John Sakai, and Paul Tsuda. Houses were at once obtained in different parts of the city for the use of classes that met to study Christianity. The number of attendants increased so rapidly that other Christians were called to help the three evangelists.

In March, 1872, the Easter services in the consular chapel were attended by about thirty believers, besides a number of other persons. The reports that these gave of the services aroused general curiosity. As the bell of the chapel rang for the meetings that were held each day of that week, crowds collected about the door. The students acted as ushers to lead the people into the chapel. Since there was room for only about a hundred persons at a time, the people were admitted in companies, a short explanation of Christian doctrine being given to each band ere it gave place to the next. Throughout the city men and women were talking about Christianity; some saying that it seemed to be a good religion, while others denounced it as immoral or dealing in magic.

Yezo, unlike the more populous parts of Japan, had not been given a prefectural government. Its affairs were administered by a Colonisation Commission, and the officials were imbued with the old-fashioned ideas. In issuing orders for the registration of the people, they required that the names of men, women, and children should be reported to the Shinto shrines. Each person would then receive an amulet that he was to preserve with care, and that was to be returned to the shrine at his death. When the officials heard that Christianity was being openly taught, they decided that it must be immediately suppressed. Dr. Sakai was arrested and asked why he had become a follower of the evil religion. When he tried to explain the teachings of Christianity, his examiner refused to listen and sent him to prison.

Three days later, Messrs. Tsuda and Kageta were ordered to appear at the office. After some delay, they were brought into the room where criminals were examined, On every side were displayed instruments of torture, whose very sight was thought sufficient to make persons tremble. With several police to guard them, the prisoners were placed before a platform on which were seated the examining official and his clerk. After the names and ages of the evangelists had been recorded, they were asked:

"On what business did you come to this city?"

"I came," answered Mr. Tsuda, "for the purpose of studying the Russian language."

"Under that name you are also studying Christianity. Why are you doing so?"

"In these days, when Japan is having dealings with other nations, I am likely to be asked by foreigners why their religion has been prohibited. It seemed to me that inability to give a reason would bring disgrace upon me and upon my country. Hence, I thought it necessary to examine their doctrines. In doing so, I soon found out that there was nothing to justify opposition. The religion at which this prohibition was aimed must have been something other than that of Jesus, whose excellent teaching has brought the countries of Europe and America to their present state of civilisation. Convinced of its truth, I was led to study it more thoroughly."

"This religion of Jesus, as you call it, is just the same as Christianity, and is not Christianity strictly forbidden by the edicts that are posted throughout the land?"

"I, of course, know what is written in those edicts. Moreover, I have from childhood been acquainted with Shintoism and Confucianism, as also with Buddhism, which has been the religion of my family. Since, however, it was in the religion of Jesus that I first found the way of salvation and righteousness, I have desired to learn all that I could about it."

"Since you are a student, there may be some reason for making an investigation of Christianity; but why have you been teaching it to others?"

"Jesus said that we should bestow on others the same blessings that we desire for ourselves. Hence, it is my wish to teach this religion, not merely in Hakodate, but in all parts of Japan."

"The people of Hakodate are unintelligent. Hitherto they have been satisfied with Buddhism. To teach them something new, even though it may be good in itself, will only confuse them."

Mr. Tsuda seemed vexed at these words and said: "Intelligence and lack of intelligence depend largely on the degree of instruction that a person receives. Hence, I am specially desirous to teach those that are ignorant."

The officer, who seemed to be seeking some ground for pronouncing a sentence of condemnation, again asserted: "The religion of Jesus is certainly the same as that which has long been prohibited."

"Is it prohibited because it is evil, or because it is good?" asked Mr. Tsuda, thinking that if the answer was that it was evil, he would ask to be shown what points in it were evil; while if acknowledgement were made that its doctrines were good, he would ask why then it was to be suppressed.

The officer, however, waived the question, and simply said: "Law is law, and you as a law-breaker should tremble at thought of your wrong-doing."

"I am not conscious," said Mr, Tsuda, "of being a law-breaker, for I have done nothing but study a good religion."

After some further questioning, the two evangelists were sent to the military prison to await trial. They were closely guarded to see that they did not make use of magic arts to effect an escape. They relieved the dulness of their imprisonment by prayers, hymns, and conversation. Finally they gained permission to receive some books from their friends. When arrested, Mr, Tsuda had hidden a portion of the Scriptures in his bosom, but had not dared to read it until now, when he slipped it among the volumes received from outside. After a while the guard happened to notice it, and all the books were taken away.

As Dr. Sakai was not a *samurai,* he was put in the criminal prison, where, with fifteen other persons, he occupied a room fifteen feet long and nine wide. He made for himself a rosary by stringing pellets of boiled rice on a thread drawn from his clothes, while a chop-stick furnished the wood for a cross.

The arrests of the evangelists caused so much alarm that the people no longer flocked to the chapel. Even the street merchants, who had formerly furnished supplies for the school, did not dare to enter the premises. When believers appeared on the street they were avoided by their acquaintances. One young man was expelled from a government school, and some other students were not allowed to live in the dormitories.

The Colonisation Commission tried in vain to make the evangelists recant, and then, not knowing what to do with them, sent a report to the Department of Justice with a request for instructions. The report arrived at about the time the case of the Sendai Christians was decided, and orders were sent for the release of the evangelists. They were set free on May 1, after an imprisonment of about two months. At the same time the officials of the Colonisation Commission sent word to the prefectures to which these men belonged, asking that they be summoned to return to their homes.

An official messenger soon came from Sendai for Messrs. Kageta and Tsuda; but, knowing that they had committed no crime, he consented to postpone their return, he himself waiting for them until the last part of August. He then accompanied them to the prefectural office in Sendai, whence they were sent to their own villages after being told that, as their trouble had come from their connection with Christianity, they must be careful to avoid further offence in that respect. They paid so little heed to this warning that they were soon actively engaged in propagating their faith.

Dr. Sakai's home was north of Sendai, in what was then the Tome Prefecture. There was still more delay in his return, but he finally reached his native town, where he was put under the care of a relative, who had strict orders that Dr. Sakai was not to go elsewhere without permission, and was not to teach Christianity. In spite of these directions, he tried to tell his friends about his new belief; but they feared to have anything to do with a religion that had brought him into so much trouble. He therefore turned his attention to neighbouring villages. In one of these he was encouraged by the conversion of a young man named Semba, who soon afterwards visited Tokyo, where he received baptism.

In 1872, Père Nicolai procured, in the name of the Russian Legation, the lease of a piece of ground on Surugadai, a hill situated in a central and populous part of Tokyo. The location seemed a favourable one for his school, and also for the church that he had faith to believe would be erected before many years. The buildings already there were low and dingy; but the funds at his disposal were insufficient to provide anything better. He took one of them for his own residence, and in the others soon gathered a number of students. Most of them came for secular instruction. Père Nicolai taught them Russian by day, and in the evening he explained Christian doctrines to those that were willing to listen. A number of the pupils soon asked for baptism, and it was administered September 24, 1872, to ten persons. As the attitude of the Government towards Christianity was still doubtful, it was deemed advisable to use the greatest secrecy. A few days later, Père Nicolai, who had become well acquainted with one of the Buddhist priests in the Shiba Temples, was calling upon him, when the priest passed over a piece of paper saying: "See what I have here." Père Nicolai, little suspecting what it was, unrolled the paper and saw to his amazement that it contained a plan of the room where the baptismal service had been held. The places where he and each of the neophytes had stood were designated, as well as the position of the utensils used in connection with the ceremony. He was greatly disturbed at this, apprehending that some evil was about to fall on the young men, whose secret profession of Christianity had evidently been discovered. The priest, with a smile, told him not to be alarmed. A report of the matter, he said, had reached the Government, and on account of the connection of the temple with national affairs, a copy of the plan had been given to him, but there was no intention of making any trouble over what had been done.

It was afterwards found out that the sketch had been drawn by a friend of one of the persons baptised. He was a spy who, having in some way learned of what was to be done, gained permission to be present.

This occurrence, which at first caused anxiety, became a source of assurance, for the inaction of the Government seemed to show that it was not inclined to prevent its subjects from embracing Christianity. In December, ten more persons were baptised.

Père Nicolai's name was becoming well known among all classes of people, and various stories concerning him were in circulation. Some said that he belonged to the Imperial Family of Russia; many considered him a spy; and others believed that he had been sent to win men's hearts in order to facilitate the military conquest of Japan. Knowing that some of the officials suspected him of political designs, he sent to the Foreign Department a memorial, in which he denied that the doctrines of Christianity tended to shake the loyalty or patriotism of those that accepted them. The suspicion of the Government was not easily allayed. It had several spies enter the school to see whether anything taught there was likely to be a source of danger. One of these men became a Christian, and prepared a petition in favour of the public recognition of Christianity. Contrary to the advice of Mr. Ono, he tried to have this presented to the Emperor; but probably it did not get far beyond the first official into whose hands it came.\*

### THE EXPANSION OF THE CHURCH   1873-1882





JOHN SAKAI had not "been very long in his native province before he obtained permission to make a visit to Tokyo. Instead of returning home from that city, he went in May, 1873, to Hakodate. Though he sent word to the officials of the Colonisation Commission that he intended to reside there, he received nothing from them to show that they objected to this or were taking any notice of his presence. He was soon engaged as busily as ever in evangelistic work. At the beginning of the next year, however, the officials of his own prefecture sent a messenger to escort him back. He was brought to the prefectural office and asked why he had gone to Hakodate. To this he replied that, as his wife and child were living in that city, he had found it necessary to go there in order to provide for their support. He was then accused of using the name Sakai illegally. The name was, indeed, that of his ancestors; but his father had "married into another house" and so taken his wife's name. After his son's birth, the father had left his adopted house. The boy, after remaining for some years with the mother, had gone to the father, and on the latter's death succeeded to his practice as a physician, at the same time assuming the name of Sakai. As there was some irregularity in this procedure, the officials took advantage of the opportunity it gave for bringing a charge against him. That this was used only as a pretext, was shown by the fact that the one who conducted the examination offered to release him on condition that he would renounce Christianity; but since he refused to do this, he was sent to prison for a month.

Soon after the expiration of this sentence, Dr. Sakai was again summoned to the office and asked:

"Why is it that since being let out of prison you have broken your promise not to preach Christianity?"

"I never made such a promise," was the reply; "nevertheless, since my release, I have not attempted to do missionary work. When I go about my duties as a physician, people ask me questions concerning my religious views, and I must make some reply. I could not refuse to answer if they asked about Buddhism or Shintoism; still less, when their enquiries are about Christianity, If you forbid this, I am willing, for my disobedience, to suffer whatever you may inflict upon my body, but my spirit will not yield to such commands."

At a later examination he was asked: "Why not give up Christianity until the Government approves of it? Ought you not to do what it commands?"

"Not if it commands what is wrong. If it ordered me to steal, I should not obey."

He was condemned to eighty days' incarceration. At that time it was customary to let out the labour of prisoners. Dr. Sakai was employed in the garden of a man who often came out to converse with him while he was at work. Religious subjects were introduced, and the man became so much interested that he continued to hire Dr. Sakai from day to day, often inviting him into the house, where they could converse more at ease. The officials said in one of their reports that it was useless to imprison such a person as Dr. Sakai, for while at work he was preaching to his employer, and after the day's labour was over he taught his doctrines to the other prisoners. Among the latter he gained considerable influence. They thought him a strange person, but could not fail to honour his upright character. When disputes arose among them, he was chosen to act as their judge. To keep him in prison was nearly equivalent to placing a Christian chaplain there.

While Dr. Sakai was in Hakodate, Mr. Semba, the young man whom he had led to Christianity at the time of his first recall to Tome, was teaching his new faith to the people about him. The Buddhist and Shinto priests soon accused him of sacrilegious acts, and had him sentenced to prison for three months. He also was earnest in teaching his fellow-prisoners. One of them became a believer, and promised that as soon as released, he would go to Tokyo for baptism. This person, however, was soon sentenced to death for his crimes. He was much distressed at the thought of not receiving the rite that would admit him into the Church. Therefore, on the morning that the man was to be led out for execution, Mr. Semba took some water from a teakettle and baptised him. Then, kneading some boiled rice into dough, he strengthened it with threads drawn from his clothes, so as to mold it into the form of a cross, which the criminal wore about his neck as he went to meet death.

Preaching places were gradually opened in different parts of Tokyo, and these were manned by those who were receiving instruction from Père Nicolai. Some of these also made visits to Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. They reported that everywhere abundant openings for the Gospel were found.

With the increasing number of evangelists, a difference arose in the views of those in Tokyo and those in Sendai, concerning the policy that should govern missionary operations. Père Nicolai, therefore, called all of them together for a council that met in May, 1874. Several days were spent in consulting about the interests of the work, and in drawing up a new set of rules. According to these regulations, there were to be two classes of workers; viz., evangelists and assistant evangelists. The duties and salaries of these persons were prescribed. Changes in the location of evangelists were to be decided by the Tokyo Church as the metropolitan. While making the proclamation of the Gospel their chief work, the evangelists might employ their spare time in any occupation for which they were fitted, and thus, by their industry, be an example to believers. They could admit persons to the number of catechumens. They ought to give lodging in their houses to persons from other places who came with a desire to learn about Christianity. If such a person were poor, he might be fed for three days at the expense of the general fund. If among the poor students should be found such as appeared proper persons to become evangelists, they might be supported for three months or more from the general fund; and after examination, the Tokyo Church should decide upon the time when they should come to it for further study. Those selected to become evangelists should be between seventeen and forty years of age, pious, intelligent, and without such hindrances on account of family affairs as would keep them from making missionary tours. Young men between twelve and seventeen years of age, of upright character and good mental ability, might be sent to school in Tokyo; those of them that intended to enter the service of the Church must have their parents' permission for spending seven years in study. Plans should be made for schools where children could receive both secular and religious teaching. For the instruction of women and girls there should be women evangelists and special schools. Evangelists should appoint in each church under their care two or three persons to serve as assistants; these should labour for the spread of the Gospel and the strengthening of the churches, besides caring for the families of the evangelists when the latter were absent on missionary tours. Though local churches should manage their own affairs without interference from others, the salaries of evangelists in some of the smaller places were to be sent through the superintendent of the district in which they belonged. At this meeting the fields of labour for over thirty evangelists were determined.

One of the rules that Père Nicolai had drawn up about 1869 for the Association of Evangelists that he hoped to form, was to the effect that when the number of baptised believers reached five hundred, one of the evangelists should be selected for ordination to the priesthood. The prosperity that had attended the work of the Mission had been such as to justify the carrying into effect what this rule prescribed, and the visit of a Russian bishop to Hakodate in 1875 was utilised for securing the ordination of Mr. Sawabe as a priest and of Dr. Sakai as a deacon. In 1878 five evangelists went to Vladivostock for ordination to the priesthood.

The most marked progress of the period under consideration was in the section of the country that has Sendai for its centre. The number of Christians in the city of Sendai and their influence were constantly increasing. In May, 1876, they took upon themselves the financial support of one of the evangelists. Some of the other evangelists in that place were unwilling either to be a burden to their brethren or to receive help from the Mission. They therefore decided to support themselves by labour or trade, giving only their spare time to teaching Christianity. Their withdrawal to this extent from evangelistic labours was regarded with so much concern by the Church that a meeting was held in which it was decided to ask them to devote themselves as before to the propagation of Christianity. Mr. Ono consented to become an evangelist again, though he continued to provide for his own support, as he was in possession of some property. The others refused to comply with the request, whereupon Père Nicolai sent them a letter in which he commended their desire not to be burdensome to the Church, but said that, while they needed little for their support, it took most of their time to gain that little, and it would be better for them to present this time to God by using it for the benefit of the Church. Some of them finally consented to follow his advice that they accept support from the general fund used for the work of the Mission. When Père Nicolai visited Sendai in 1877, a meeting of the Christians was held to consult with him concerning evangelistic efforts, one of the decisions being to divide the city into five parishes.

In 1877 Mr. Ono began to publish what is said to have been the first magazine in Northeastern Japan. The articles, which dealt with moral, literary, and educational, as well as strictly religious subjects, attracted considerable attention and did much to put new ideas into the minds of the educated classes. The evangelists also arranged a course of public lectures that were held twice a month. Though the subjects were largely secular and some of the speakers were not Christians, the lectures of the evangelists often turned to Christian themes, while their efforts in seeking the enlightenment of the people helped to recommend their religion.

In 1874, when Dr. Sakai and Mr. Semba were under arrest in Tome, two merchants from Sanuma were in the former town on business. Hearing of what had happened, their curiosity was aroused to know the nature of the religion that brought upon its followers the opposition of the officials. In an interview that they managed to obtain with Dr. Sakai they were much impressed by what he told them. After his release he visited them in Sanuma, which was only seven miles from Tome, Fearing that they would bring trouble upon themselves, the merchants were at first very careful not to let others know that they were studying Christianity; but, after they became believers, they no longer wished to keep it to themselves, and so they commenced telling others of their new faith. The town was visited by different evangelists, one of whom took up his abode there. From the first the work progressed so rapidly that in 1875 fifty-three persons were baptised; in 1876, one hundred; in 1877, ninety-three. In 1876 considerable opposition was aroused against Christianity because one of the believers, with the idea of showing the folly of idol worship, dragged an image from a shrine that stood on his land, chopped it to pieces, and then destroyed the shrine. He and eleven others that had taken some part in the matter were brought before the courts and fined. In 1879 a church building was completed at a cost of some three thousand *yen.* Rev. Paul Sawabe then urged upon the believers the desirability of having the building provided with the various utensils used in the ceremonies of the Greek Church, whereupon the women brought their hair-ornaments, some of which had considerable value, as contributions towards the cost of what was needed.

Besides Sanuma, several other towns in the vicinity of Sendai were visited by evangelists, so that there were few places of any importance that did not have believers in Christianity. In some places church buildings were erected and schools established. In several towns the Christians raised funds that were invested so that the interest might be used for the support of the church or else added to the original fund until a sufficient amount should have been gained for a church edifice or some other object. In some cases land was purchased and cultivated by the Christians. At one time the fund at Sanuma amounted to several thousand *yen.*

In 1879 Père Anatolius, having been appointed Chaplain to the Russian Legation, removed from Hakodate to Tokyo. After this, other Russian priests went to Hakodate, but none of them stayed for any great length of time, and ere long the care of the Church in that city and the work of carrying Christianity to other parts of Yezo were committed to Japanese priests and evangelists. It is one of the noteworthy features of the Holy Orthodox Church in Japan that it has depended so little upon the personal labours of foreigners. Much of the time Père Nicolai was the only one in the country, and at no other time has he had more than five or six European assistants.

As with the Protestants and Roman Catholics, the members of this Church early began to show that they had learned from the second of Christ's great commandments the duty of charity. About 1873 the Christian women of Hakodate formed a society whose purpose was in part to help the poor. Their zeal stirred up that of the men. Among the gifts of that year was a sum of money sent for the relief of those who were suffering from a famine in Russia. In Sendai and other places there were societies that lent money, sometimes with and sometimes without interest, to members of the churches. Some of the funds were given outright to those that would be unable to repay. In 1875, when the overflowing of a river caused great distress among the poor in Sanuma, the Christians of that place took measures for their relief. Rice was purchased, and at night members of the Church, covering their faces so as not to be recognised, carried this to about a hundred poor families and gave it over without letting it be known whence it came.

Trouble frequently arose in connection with the burial of the dead. In January, 1875, the father of a young girl that had died in Hakodate gave the usual notice to the officials and told the Buddhist priests of his intention to have a Christian burial. He was soon summoned to the office and told that only Buddhist or Shinto rites could be allowed. To this he replied:

"My daughter was a Christian and so am I. To have a heathen ceremony would be to disobey the commands of the true God, and so I cannot permit such to be performed."

"But Christian rites are contrary to law."

"I must obey God. If by so doing I offend against the laws of the land, I must submit to the punishment that awaits me."

Some of the friends advised that the burial should be in a cemetery that had been set apart for the use of foreigners, over which the priests had no control; but the father said that this was something to which a Japanese ought not to consent, and rather than do it, he would suffer the penalty that might be incurred by violating the law. Finally the burial took place in a piece of ground that Père Anatolius succeeded in renting for a cemetery, and though the father was afterwards summoned before the officials, no punishment was inflicted upon him.

About the same time a similar case occurred in Sendai, where the person responsible for the burial was sentenced to thirty days' imprisonment. The relatives sent in a petition that led to an amelioration of the punishment, so that the man was not taken to prison but confined in his own house. In another place a man was sentenced to prison for forty days; but in view of the fact that he had followed the dying wish of his relatives, he was released on the payment of three *yen.*

### RECENT HISTORY OF THE MISSION   1883-1909





MATERIALS for writing the later history of the Greek Church in Japan are not such as can be utilised to any great extent in the present work. The news columns of the periodicals that it publishes will be of great value to its own historian, but the facts recorded need to be collated by some one so intimately acquainted with the inner working of the Church that he can select those that have proved to be of the most importance. It is to be hoped that the excellent history \(in Japanese\) whose earlier volumes have helped in the preparation of former chapters will ere long be brought down to a later date.

In a general way it may be said that, while the Orthodox Church continued to grow in numbers and strength, its rapid progress was checked a little earlier than was the case with Protestantism. Bishop Nicolai continued to be a marvel of executive ability and personal influence; the evangelists were active and earnest; in many places they gathered companies of believers; and yet, with the exception of northeastern Hondo, the degree of success attained was not such as attracted much notice from people at large. Persons that became interested in Christianity were inclined to examine it in its Protestant forms. The relations of the Orthodox Church to the Russian Government doubtless had much to do with this. Suspicion of Russia's movements and of what it might be planning to do in Korea made the former country and everything connected with it unpopular with the young men of Japan. This feeling was greatly increased at the close of the Chino-Japanese War \(1895\) when Russia took the lead in preventing Japan from retaining any territory on the Asiatic continent and soon after took for its own use the Laiotung Peninsula, which had been Japan's most important conquest in the war. The following statement prepared in 1903, by one of Bishop Nicolai's assistants, shows what response was made to the objection that came from the prejudice felt against Russia:

"From the present political situation of Japan and Russia, since the Japanese Orthodox Church is aided by the Russian Missionary Society, some are led to believe that the Church is necessarily Russianised and given to Russian forms. This is indeed a misapprehension. Such misconceptions have occurred in every age and we rather pity those who thus misunderstand us. It will be evident to one who has observed both the Russian Orthodox Church and the Japanese Orthodox Church, that the Japanese Church is not Russianised at all, even though it be aided by Russia. Bishop Nicolai, who is the apostle to Japan, did not introduce customs which were exclusively Russian at all. He only handed down the doctrines and customs of the Eastern Church of the Holy Catholic Apostles. In 1893 Archbishop Deonishi of Zante. an island off the west coast of Greece, visited our Japanese Orthodox Church. The Archbishop is a Greek and belongs to the Greek Church. However, he came to the Cathedral at Surugadai and worshipped with Japanese priests without changing bis form of worship. He thus proved by his action that the Japanese Orthodox Church, which was established by the Russian Missionary Society, is just the same as those Orthodox Churches found in Greece and neighbouring countries. In the year 1895 Archbishop Gerashim of Jerusalem sent to our Japanese Orthodox Church a holy image that our reciprocal and harmonious relations might thereby be manifest. This shows plainly that the Orthodox Church established in Jerusalem is wholly like the Orthodox Churches found in all Eastern Europe."\*

Besides the objection growing out of its relation to Russia, the Orthodox Church shared with others the popular dislike of Christianity. The following instances will show how this dislike manifested itself.

In 1894 an evangelist visited a village in the province of Ise where there were two converts. The villagers were soon aroused to active opposition, and drew up a covenant containing the following articles:

"Christians shall be deprived of their former rights in the common forests."

"Christians shall not be admitted into our houses, nor will we enter theirs. If it is necessary to transact any business with them, we will stand outside of their houses while talking with them."

"We will prevent the Christians from working in the mountains. We will not turn aside for them when we meet them upon the street."\*

In a village of Akita Prefecture under similar circumstances Buddhist priests from abroad were summoned to oppose the hated religion, and a document was drawn up pledging the villagers to break off all relations with Christians, not to allow them to hold any office, not to rent land to them, not to furnish lodging for the preachers, and to treat as Christians all persons that would not set their seal to this agreement. There was an attempt to break up the meetings, stones were thrown, and blows struck.†

In Shirakawa, Fukushima Prefecture, a town of ten thousand inhabitants, enmity was excited against the Christians because of their refusal to contribute towards the expenses of a religious festival. Some of their houses were injured by stones thrown against them. One believer and his wife were dragged out from their house and received several wounds. Three of the men that made the disturbance were arrested by the police, but were soon released.‡

In places where both Greek and Protestant evangelists were working, their relations, though not very close, were usually cordial except as sometimes feeling was aroused by the converts of one passing over to the other. In case the removal was from the Greek Church, the severe terms of the ban of excommunication prescribed by its ritual were not calculated to promote harmony.

In the city of Wakayama the workers of the Greek Orthodox, the Episcopalian, and the Presbyterian churches, thirteen in number, and including four foreign missionaries, had a society which met once a month. The church-members also had an alliance that provided for public lectures once a month. When attempts were made in 1898 to introduce into Wakayama Prefecture the system of licensed prostitution, from which it had hitherto been exempt, the Protestant churches proposed to the Greek and Roman Catholic that they should unite in opposing this effort. This was done; letters signed by representatives of each church were sent out, officials and legislators were interviewed, and a mass meeting was held in a theatre with addresses by the Protestant and Greek evangelists.\*

When war broke out in 1904 between Japan and Russia, Bishop Nicolai was in a very trying position. Two Russian priests attached to the Russian legation, who had assisted him in his work, returned home. The Bishop, urged by the Russian Minister, to decide at once whether or not he would leave the country, called a council of the workers and leading Christians to ask their opinion about what he would better do. They were unanimous in adopting a resolution in which they said: "We earnestly hope, whatever may happen, that you will not return to your own country, but that for the sake of the Orthodox Church in Japan you will remain here." This decision having been reported to him, he addressed them the next day as follows:

"I did not make up my mind until yesterday whether I should remain in Japan or not in case of a Russo-Japanese war. If I returned to Russia, I should still have much business to attend to on behalf of our missions, but I have decided to remain in Japan. I am very glad to hear that your members unanimously decided that I should not return to Russia. I believe this is God's will. Especially I felt this to-day when I was praying during the service. My indecision up till yesterday belonged to my private convenience and not to the public. To say the truth, it is about twenty-three years since I left my native country, and a longing crept over me to return to my sweet home. But thinking the matter over more seriously, I realised that this was only my private inclination and that my public life belonged to Japan where our Church is yet in its infancy. Now I am thanking my God that your members have decided the question for me as you have. And again, I thank you for your kindness and that of your members in providing for my safety in case personal danger threatened. You say that I need not enter a foreign legation, that you will protect me. But I think such a promise is not necessary. Our Russian Minister will provide for the protection of Russian subjects in Japan by either the French or German Ministers when he withdraws from Tokyo, and, moreover, the Japanese Government will protect such Russians who have no relations with the war. But it will be necessary to ask for the protection of the authorities for the safety of our Cathedral and all the buildings of the Church. These buildings are the property of the Japanese Orthodox Church, and in case they are violated \(which I think will not be the case\) your members would suffer a great loss.

"I hope there will be no change in our Church through the outbreak of war. Evangelists must propagate the Master's Gospel, students must attend the Mission School as usual and I will devote myself to the translation of the Prayer-book with my assistant. Mr. Nakae. And if an imperial Proclamation of war is issued, your members must pray for the triumph of Japan and when the Japanese army has conquered the Russian forces you must offer to God a prayer of thankfulness. This is the obligation laid on the Orthodox Christian in his native country Our Lord Jesus Christ teaches us patriotism and loyalty. Christ Himself shed tears for Jerusalem. That was because of His patriotism, and you must follow in your Master's steps.

"I prayed as usual to-day in the Cathedral, but henceforth I Will not take part in the public prayers. This is not for the reason that it might be dangerous for me to appear in the Cathedral, but for the reason that until now I prayed for the victory and the peace of the Japanese Emperor, but now in case of war I can not pray as a Russian subject that our native country should be conquered by an enemy. I have, as you also have, an obligation to my country, therefore I am glad to see that you realise your obligation to your country. For myself. I will not for the time being serve in the public prayers of the Japanese Church."\*

The decision of Bishop Nicolai was generally commended both by Japanese and by foreign residents. Doubtless it was also pleasing to the Government, since it gave an opportunity to show to the Western World its unwillingness to have the war regarded as in any sense a conflict with the Christian religion. Another address made by Bishop Nicolai about five months after the beginning of the war expressed his appreciation of the attitude of the Japanese Government, and spoke of the difficulties experienced by the Church. It will also serve to show us something of his own spirit. He said:

"Dear brethren and co-workers. Our meeting is at an unfavourable time for the Church, hut from our hearts we give thanks and praise God that through His mercy the Church remains in peace unmolested and that its members still maintain their good faith, each worker doing his duty faithfully. We also give thanks to the Japanese Government for its kind protection. From the beginning of this war, the Government declared that religion and politics or war should not be confounded, that no one should be hindered in religious rites or faith. As you know, this declaration has been kept. Only one or two suspicious persons have disturbed the peace of our Christians, and they have since been suppressed by the local governors. But the protection of the Government is only from the outside storm, and if in the inner life of the Church troubles should arise, the Government cannot protect us. A rotten boat is easily sunk by the waves; a worm-eaten tree falls easily by the wind. Toward our Church there is at present no heavy storm, but there are winds of hatred brewing by which we have so far been unmoved. No Christians have broken faith, no workers have left their posts of duty. As the blood flows through the whole body and gives life, we have evidence that just so the mercies of God are flowing through our Church body and that the Greek Church of japan is not built upon the sand but is founded upon the Corner-stone for eternity. Brethren, observe this and know that God has accepted and blessed our little service, and rejoices that our labour is not in vain. Is this not a great comfort and consolation to us? Our Church is not only existing in the midst of this troublous time, but it is growing. Of course, the number of additions this year is less than last. The voice of the Gospel of Peace is drowned by the shouts of war. It is hard to reach the ear, but some few have heard and accepted, and these are precious fruit to the Kingdom of God."\*

The members of the Orthodox Church did not fall behind others in patriotism. At the beginning of the war they organised a society to give aid to the families that were in distress because the chief wage-earners had been called to the army. Teachers and students in the theological schools collected money with which to print several thousand copies of "Japanese-Russian Military Conversations," and these they presented to the War Department.

When, as a result of Japanese victories, large numbers of prisoners were brought to Japan, a new and interesting work devolved upon this Church. By the permission of the War Department, priests with an understanding of the Russian language were sent to all the towns where captives were detained, and temporary places of worship were set up within the camps. To many a homesick man it must have been a great comfort to listen to the familiar liturgy and to take part in the rites to which he had been accustomed from childhood. As the number of priests was insufficient for this new service, several persons were ordained sooner than they would otherwise have been. Much liberty was given to the Russian officers. Those that wished to do so could attend the ordinary churches, if such there were in the cities where they were held as prisoners. The following report gives a brief account of the work among the captives:

"Owing to the war, our evangelistic work among the Japanese people was hindered because of the especial work God had for us among the 73,000 Russian prisoners. Since our Church in Japan is small, we could not comfort the prisoners as we would have liked to do. Seventeen priests and six assistant priests who understood the Russian language devoted their full time to the work. Beside these, the older priests who could not speak the language had with them assistant priests as interpreters. These men conducted prayers and administered the sacrament in such a manner as to afford the prisoners all the religious comforts of their home land. The prisoners received the Japanese priests in all love and respect as if of their native blood, counting them all God's workers. As a proof of their deep appreciation of the work done among them, Bishop Nicolai has received many letters requesting him to extend to these Japanese workers most hearty thanks. Not only these letters have been received, but also presents of very valuable cloth. While the Japanese workers have given their time to comforting the prisoners, they have in return been greatly strengthened in faith by witnessing the devotion of these men even in hours of deep trial. The Russian men raised *yen* 11,700 for Bishop Nicolai's work. They built several chapels where they happened to be quartered, and paid all expenses in connection with the religious work among them. Bishop Nicolai gave to the prisoners 68,000 copies of the Gospels in the Russian language and several thousand copies of religious and literary books, also many prayer-books and silver-woven cloth. He also gave winter clothes to sick prisoners. All of these expenses were met by Christians from abroad."\*

A society was also organised for helping the Japanese prisoners in Russia, Three thousand "comfort bags" were sent to these men.

At *a,* time when Protestant and Roman Catholic Christians were often suspected of being spies in the employ of the enemy, the members of a church closely related to Russia could not well escape being charged by the common people with disloyal acts. In some cases they were in danger of violence, and occasionally damage was done to church property. There was reason to fear that in Tokyo an attack might be made on the Cathedral, whose location on one of the most commanding sites in the city had long made it an object of popular dislike. The land on which it was built had originally been granted to the Russian Legation, in whose name it was still held, and some argued that it ought now be seized as the property of a hostile nation. The Japanese Government, however, took care to frown upon all such expressions of hatred. The Cathedral was carefully guarded by the police and, so far as known, no serious attempt to harm it was made by the populace.

During the time of withdrawal from the more active duties of his episcopate, Bishop Nicolai was largely occupied with literary labours. A report for 1904 says:

"In the publication department of the Church, we have nine men who are engaged solely in translation, and besides these there are three editors of magazines and church literature. The official organ of the Church is the *Seikyo Shimpo,* published fortnightly. The *Seikyo Yowa,* a monthly magazine, is devoted mostly to sermons and religious instructions for the edification of the Christians. The *Uranishiki* is a monthly periodical especially for women."\*

This work was under the close supervision of Bishop Nicolai. Previously to this he had prepared a translation of the New Testament. The Orthodox Church had for a long time used the version made by the Protestants. Bishop Nicolai was not fully satisfied with this, partly because he thought it had been too much influenced by the English translation and partly because he considered its style as too near that of the colloquial language, and thus as lacking in the dignity that was desirable in such a book. His own translation made more use of Chinese terms and archaic forms.

In 1906 Bishop Nicolai was raised to the rank of Archbishop, and Père Andronik, who some years before had spent a short time in Japan as a member of the Mission, was made a bishop. The latter had hardly reached Japan the next spring when his health gave way and he was obliged to return ere he had fully entered upon the duties of his office. In 1908 another bishop was sent out to take his place.

After the war with Japan, the disturbed state of Russia, and the financial stringency existing there, led to a great falling off in the receipts of the Russian Missionary Society. This necessitated a reduction in the activities of the Japanese Church. At the Annual Convention held in July, 1907, it was decided to lessen expenses by diminishing the number of evangelists and students. This difficulty was bravely met by the Archbishop. A statement prepared under his direction says: "Faced as it is by the necessity of attaining self-support, the Japanese Church will rather look upon this necessity as a providence of the Most High, which is designed to be a strong stimulus to further progress."

Hitherto, this Church had made but little advance in the way of self-support; and it may be that, as has been the case with some others, the lessening of foreign aid will prove a blessing, and that what now seems a misfortune will hereafter be looked upon as one of the best things that could have happened to it at this stage of its development.

A HISTORY OF  
CHRISTIANITY  
IN JAPAN



PROTESTANT MISSIONS





by  
OTIS CARY, D.D.  
FOR THIRTY YEARS MISSIONARY OF THE A. B. C. F. M.








## 
VOLUME TWO

### 
#### PREFACE



THIS book with a companion volume that treats of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox missions is an attempt to describe the chief events connected with the history of Christianity in Japan. It labours under the disadvantage of dealing with occurrences so close at hand that it is difficult to see them in their right perspective and so to judge of their comparative importance. It is, however, easier now than it will ever be again to gather materials such as are needed for the earlier chapters of such a book, and the completion of the first half-century of organised Protestant missions in Japan presents a suitable occasion for looking back upon what has happened within that period.

I have confined myself for the most part to the simple narrative of events, indulging in but little comment and in no philosophising upon them. Let him who reads draw his own lessons from the story.

The narrative centres about the work of the missionaries and does not describe with any degree of completeness what has been done by the Japanese Christians. I wish that it were otherwise: for, after the first foundations had been laid, the upbuilding of the Christian Church has been chiefly accomplished through the earnest efforts of the Japanese workers. To a considerable extent, however, their labours have been of that plodding, uneventful nature that does not furnish much striking material for a book of this kind. Moreover, such material as could be utilised is difficult to collect. Foreign missionary societies publish the correspondence of their representatives, and this naturally deals chiefly with events that have a direct connection with the missionaries themselves; but an exhaustive search through Japanese religious periodicals and a careful working over of what might there be found is needed for an adequate account of what has been done by pastors, evangelists, and other Christian workers—a task that must be left for some Japanese writer of the future who shall narrate the history of Christianity in his own country more completely than it is possible for an alien to do.

To Japanese readers it will doubtless seem that in passages dealing with the unfortunate misunderstandings that have occasionally arisen between missionaries and the Japanese Christians I have shown partiality for the former. It could hardly be otherwise; for, if I write as things appear to me, the result cannot fail to be coloured by my prejudices. I believe that my Japanese friends would prefer, all things considered, to have me write frankly my own views upon these matters, while trying at the same time to state theirs with fairness. Some incidents that I would gladly have passed over unnoticed were so connected with the general course of events that this could not be honestly done. These matters, though forming an integral part of the history, are after all but a small part thereof; and. while our opinions concerning them may differ, it is hoped that we can be charitable to each other, allowing each to hold and express his own views upon them.

The different missions are disproportionately treated. Doubtless that of the American Board occupies an undue amount of space. As a member of that mission I know more of its history and have had better opportunities for inquiry than is the case with others. Moreover, circumstances caused this mission and the churches that grew up in connection with its work to have a prominent place in some of the movements that greatly affected the history with which we have to deal. I have tried, however, to write impartially of the different bodies working in Japan, and have only once or twice ventured upon any criticisms.

Most of the materials for this book have been drawn from the magazines and reports published by missionary societies, from Japanese papers, the "Japan Evangelist," the historical sketches contained in the reports of the General Missionary Conferences, Ritter's "History of Protestant Missions in Japan," and, for events in the present century, from the annual issues of "The Christian Movement in Japan," published under the auspices of the Standing Committee of Cooperating Missions. Like nearly all writers upon Japanese subjects, I have made great use of "The Japan Mail," an English newspaper published in Yokohama. Its translations from Japanese papers have been of special value.

Doubtless some errors will be discovered by those conversant with the events narrated. It is astonishing how hard it is to find the exact truth about even recent affairs. Errors of one writer are copied by another and perhaps come to be so generally accepted that he who narrates what actually happened is thought to make a mistake. I have spent considerable time in trying to learn the truth upon points where doubts concerning the current story were aroused; but it may be that while trying to strain out some little gnat of error I have allowed heavily-laden camels to slip through unnoticed. Future historians will join with me in being thankful to those who will lasso and throttle these beasts, and also to those who will help to exterminate the annoying little gnats.

Those acquainted with the Japanese language may criticise my way of writing some words. I have omitted the marks that designate long vowels because they are somewhat misleading to the general reader and because it is difficult to secure such accurate proof-reading as would ensure against mistakes Again, though Japanese nouns have usually no distinction of number, it has seemed best for the sake of clearness to use such plurals as *daimyos,* etc.

A considerable portion of what is found in this book was used in the Hyde Lectures on Foreign Missions, given at Andover Theological Seminary in December, 1909.

My hope and prayer is that this volume will help to increase the interest of the Christian world in the evangelisation of Japan, and not of Japan only, but of other lands, for in them, too, the fields are already white unto harvest and the time has come for the Church of Christ to reap the results of the labours of those that bore the heat and burden of the day when the hard ground had to be broken up and the seed sown in soil that seemed little fitted for its reception.

### WAITING BEFORE THE CLOSED GATES 

AT the middle of the nineteenth century Japan was a hermit nation. Three hundred years had passed since it had first been visited by Europeans. Almost immediately after merchants found their way thither, Roman Catholic missionaries began those labours that at one time seemed likely to result in the speedy winning of Japan to their Church. Then came an era of bitter opposition that resulted in the apparent extirpation of Christianity. All Europeans were driven from the land except as the Dutch merchants were allowed to have a trading post on the tiny island of Deshima, which thus became the one point of contact between Japan and the West.

Opposition to the missionaries and their teaching was not the only reason that led Japan to adopt the policy of isolation. That opposition itself did not come chiefly from religious considerations but from a belief that the missionaries had been sent out by their sovereign to win the hearts of a portion of the Japanese people in order to facilitate the future conquest of the country. Spanish and Portuguese merchants had done not a little to make Europeans unpopular. They, too, were suspected of having a part in the schemes of their king. Some of them had by their immoral conduct shocked a people whose own standards were none too high. Notwithstanding the protests of the missionaries against the slave trade, the merchants had carried away many Japanese into servitude, and reports were current of terrible cruelties that were suffered by these unfortunate men. Though the guilt of this traffic was shared by daimyos and others who delivered into the hands of the traders criminals and captives taken in war, this did not prevent it from being an additional reason for the dislike that was felt for Europeans. Various incidents had fostered unfriendly feelings between the Japanese and the merchants of Manila and Macao. In one noteworthy case the former, in revenge for what they considered unjust treatment received at Macao, attempted to capture a vessel that had come from that port to Nagasaki, and would probably have succeeded had not the Portuguese captain, after bravely defending himself for three days, set fire to the powder magazine, thus destroying the ship with its crew, passengers, and cargo.

Whatever may have been the parts of merchants and missionaries in causing Japan to drive them forth and close the gates behind them, the commercial and religious interests of the West were earnestly hoping that in some way those gates might be unlocked so that there might again be free access to the land. Though Protestants had not the same reasons as Roman Catholics for regarding Japan with special interest, it was not long after the attention of English and American Christians had been aroused to the claims of foreign missions that some were led to make that country an object of their prayers, contributions, and efforts. The missionaries in China had hopes that they might be able to help Japan either in person or by their books. Doubtless some of their publications were carried to that land, and they could be read there by the best educated people. In 1818, when Captain Gordon of the brig *Brothers* went to the Bay of Yedo hoping to get permission for trade, large numbers of visitors came to his vessel, and he mentions giving them two Testaments besides some religious tracts printed in Chinese.\* Dr. Medhurst, the well-known missionary, found means to make some study of the Japanese language, and in 1828 he asked the Dutch for permission to go on their ship to Nagasaki. This request was refused.†

The *Missionary Herald,* the organ of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, in its issue for March, 1828, acknowledges the receipt of $27,87 as received from Brookline, Mass., "for mission to Japan," Similar entries appear from time to time in later numbers. To-day, as one turns over the leaves of the magazine and happens to light upon these words, they seem like an anachronism, since there could at that time be no mission in Japan; but "faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen," and those who made these contributions could overlook all obstacles and believe that Japan would not long be closed to the Gospel. William Ropes, a Christian merchant of Boston, whose residence was in Brookline, had invited a few friends to meet once a month at his house that they might unite in prayer for the conversion of the world. At the first meeting, when a contribution had been taken, the question arose to what object it should be devoted. On the table of the room where these friends met was a basket of Japanese workmanship that had probably been obtained through the Dutch traders. Mr. Ropes drew attention to its beauty, and his suggestion that their money be given for the evangelisation of the land from which it came was accepted. The merchant soon after this left Brookline, but a "ladies' sewing society" that grew up in connection with the other meeting often sent to the American Board sums of money "for the mission in Japan." In all, more than six hundred dollars were given, and when in 1869 the Board decided to open work in Japan, the new mission was credited with over four thousand dollars as the sum of these contributions and the accrued interest The first missionary sent to Japan by the American Board was Rev. D. C. Greene, whose father, then a young minister, was present at the first meeting in Brookline.\*

From time to time Japanese sailors driven to sea by tempests have been carried to the shores of America or cast upon some of the islands in the Pacific Ocean. Three such waifs, who had been rescued near the mouth of the Columbia River, were sent to China in the hope that some way might be found for returning them to their own land. They were placed in the care of Dr. Karl Gutzlaff, who gave them shelter in his own house at Macao. He became much interested in them and applied himself with so much zeal to the study of their language that he became able to converse with them upon simple subjects. Soon afterwards, four more Japanese, who had been wrecked on the Philippine Islands, also found a home with Dr. Gutzlaff. Mr. C. W. King, an American merchant residing in China, gave the use of his ship *Morrison* for carrying these people back to Japan. It sailed from Macao, July 4, 1837. Every precaution was taken to avoid whatever might excite the suspicion or the opposition of the Japanese. The ship's guns were left behind so that the expedition might be shown to be entirely peaceful. Much to Dr, Gutzlaff's disappointment, it was further decided that no Christian books in the Chinese language should be taken.\* This was not because Mr. King was not interested in Christian work. On the contrary, he hoped that the expedition might be a help in opening Japan to the Gospel, and three Christian missionaries accompanied him and Mrs. King on the voyage. They were Drs. Karl Gutzlaff, S. Wells Williams, and Peter Parker. Dr. Parker, being a physician, took with him a stock of medicines, some instruments, and a number of anatomical plates. He also had a paper prepared stating his profession and his willingness to give his services gratuitously to any that needed them. So far as recorded, the only opportunity Dr. Parker had for practising his art was while making a short stop in Loochoo. He lent a pamphlet on vaccination to a physician, who copied it and seemed much interested in its contents. Dr. Parker, in giving orally some further explanations about the way in which the operation should be performed, actually vaccinated the old gentleman before the latter was fully aware that the instruction was being carried to such a practical stage.

A set of papers was prepared for presentation to the Japanese Government. One of these gave the names of the shipwrecked sailors, the story of their rescue, and a request that an officer be sent on board to receive them. Another gave an account of the United States and expressed the hope that Japan would be ready to enter into friendly relations with it. In order to show that the religion of its people need not be an obstacle, the explanation was inserted: "God is worshipped by every man according to his own conscience, and there is perfect toleration of all religions. We ourselves worship the God of peace, respect our superiors, and live in harmony with one another."

A list of the presents that had been brought mentioned a portrait of Washington, a telescope, a pair of globes, an encyclopedia, a collection of American treaties, and an American history. In referring to the books, the following remark was appended: "Languages of nations differ, and perhaps ours, though much more extensively spoken than Dutch or Portuguese, may not be understood in your honourable country. If so, and at your request, one of my party shall remain in Japan a year to teach our language." There was also a list of the articles of merchandise on board, with a request that there might be free intercourse with Japanese merchants.

These documents were never delivered. The *Morrison* anchored in the Bay of Yedo, July 30. A number of boats pushed out from the shore and one or two hundred Japanese came on board, but no officer appeared. Letters asking that some one come with authority to confer with the Americans were entrusted to the visitors and it was thought that an official visit would be received the next morning. A little before dawn, however, some cannon that had been brought in the night to a, neighbouring promontory opened fire, one of the balls striking the ship without doing much damage. Bad weather was setting in, and, as there was no good anchorage that could not be commanded by batteries, it was deemed advisable to depart and renew at some other place the attempt to get into communication with officials. Since the wind and currents were unfavourable for a landing on Hondo, the Japanese waifs advised going to Kagoshima.

The reception there was similar to the one before experienced, and the *Morrison* was again fired upon. Mr. King now offered as a last resort to take the Japanese to Nagasaki, where he hoped the intercession of the Dutch would make it possible for them to land. After what had occurred, they were unwilling to be put in the hands of their country's officials and begged to be taken back to China. The *Morrison* therefore left Japanese waters and was soon back in Macao.\* Dr. Williams says of this expedition: "Commercially speaking, the voyage cost about $2,000 without any return; and the effects in a missionary or scientific way were nil. But not finally. The seven men brought back were employed in one way or another, and most of them usefully. Two remained with Mr. Gutzlaff for many years; and two worked in my printing-office at Macao; these four aided us in getting some knowledge of their language, so that between us the books of Genesis and Matthew, and the Gospel and Epistles of John were done into Japanese for their instruction. Rikimatsu, the youngest man, went to Nagasaki with Admiral Stirling in 1855 as his interpreter. He and Otosan, who lived at Shanghai, both showed in their correct lives that the faith which they professed was a living principle. They were the first fruits of the Church of Christ in Japan. . . . For nearly two years, five of them maintained daily prayer in my house at Macao; and their harsh repulse was one of the arguments they used to implore the Governor of Nations to send the Gospel to their countrymen."†

Before condemning the Japanese for refusing to receive back these waifs, we must put ourselves in their place. They might well suspect that the foreigners were using shipwrecked sailors as tools for gaining some advantage for themselves. If moved only by compassion, why did they not bring the men to Nagasaki, or, better still, send them by the Dutch ship? The Daimyo of Echizen, it is said, urged that the castaways be received; but others declared that there was danger of their introducing the Christian religion and in other ways aiding the designs of the crafty foreigners.

In 1848 Ranald McDonald, then twenty-three years old, one of the crew of the whaleship *Plymouth,* had himself left adrift in a small boat off the coast of Japan. Going to the shore, he was put under arrest and so remained until he and some other American sailors were released at the demand of Commander Glynn who visited Japan in the U. S. Ship *Preble.* The statement made by McDonald before Commander Glynn shows him to have been a man with sufficient regard for religion to lead him to take his Bible among the few effects that he brought on shore. It may possibly be that he was a religious enthusiast who had hopes of doing some missionary work. He says that when examined by the Japanese officials in Nagasaki: "They finally asked me if I believed there was a God in Heaven. I answered, Yes; that I believed in the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." At Nagasaki he was confined in a temple. He said: "The day after being put in this prison I asked for my books, particularly my Bible. The interpreter told me with a good deal of fervour or interest, 'not to speak of the Bible in Japan; it was not a good book.' "One interesting paragraph in McDonald's testimony is that in which he tells how he failed to make democracy understood when he was asked about the ship *Preble.* "The interpreter wished me to give him the relative rank of the captain of the ship by counting in the order of succession from the highest chief in the United States. First, T gave the People, which they could not comprehend; then the president of the United States, the Secretary of the Navy, commodore, post captain, and commander."\*

To Protestants as to Roman Catholics it seemed that the Loochoo Islands might be made a stepping stone for reaching Japan, since these islands were under its control, and the language was supposed to be the same. In 1843 a number of officers in the British navy formed a society called the "Loochoo Naval Mission," whose object was the teaching of Christianity to the people of the islands whose name it bore. One of the leaders in this movement was Lieutenant Clifford, who had been with Captain Basil Hall in the latter's visit to Loochoo. In 1845 the society sent out as its missionary, B. J. Bettelheim, M.D. He was a converted Jew, a Hungarian by birth, but a British subject by naturalisation. His wife was of English parentage. Dr. Peter Parker, of Canton, with whom he resided for a short time and to whom were addressed two letters that give an account of his experience in Loochoo,† said of him: "I am able to testify to his superior talents and varied learning, his talents as a linguist, and his acquirements in various languages \(speaking and writing Hebrew with the same facility as English\), and to his devoted missionary spirit."

Accompanied by his wife, his two children, and a lady who was expected to engage in educational work, he reached the harbour of Kapha, May 1, 1846. He also had with him a man hastily procured in China as an interpreter, of whom he says: "His knowledge of English was in perfect keeping with mine of Chinese, and by the time of our arrival here, we could converse with each other but very little." He also thought that the man did not understand very well the kind of Chinese that was spoken in Loochoo. The lady teacher likewise proved disappointing, for at the last moment she declared her unwillingness to land, and went back with the ship that brought her.

M. Forcade, a French missionary who had been in Loochoo for two years, came out in a boat to the ship. Dr. Bettelheim, who apparently had not known of his being there, writes of his own pleasure, not only in meeting a European, but in having a visible proof that it was possible for one to live in Loochoo, for he was sure "that what was granted to the French Tricolor could not be refused to the Union Jack." The Loochooan officials were not inclined to give a hearty welcome to the new arrivals. Dr. Bettelheim now made the most of his doubts about the interpreter's ability to understand them. He says: "Whenever my interpreter reported to me their utter unwillingness to receive or even let us land, I seemed persuaded he had not understood them, and smiled with the full assurance of one whom Captain Hall had taught better things of Loochoo."

For some reason the captain of the ship did not wish to send his boats to the shore, and the Loochooans refused to convey the foreigners. Dr. Bettelheim was equal to the emergency. He writes:

"I now saw that nothing short of a *coup-de-main* would turn the balance in my favour. Unable to get the ship's boats to land my things, which were already prepared on deck, I begged the officer on guard to let as many of them as possible be speedily lowered into the two native boats alongside the vessel, while I endeavoured to keep the owners as merry as I could in the cabin below. This was agreed to and most luckily effected before the company showed any signs of impatience. À drop of liquor is always welcome to a Loochooan, and he will sit with you so long as you fill his glass. But now a good part of my cargo being transshipped, I on my part became impatient; the mystery was revealed, and the company hastened pellmell down to their boats and shoved off at full speed as if to prevent their unexpected good luck further increasing. This was just as I desired. I had not the slightest fear of any damage being done to my goods, and could not repress an encouraging feeling crossing my bosom on beholding the natives doing something towards the reception of the missionary, although I at the same time knew they did it involuntarily.

"At this stage of affairs the captain could not of course refuse a boat to let me look after my baggage, and in this likewise some boxes were taken on shore. That we had the native boats to guide us was the most fortunate feature of the whole affair. For, had I landed without them, \[ should certainly have carried all my cargo to M. Forcade's dwelling, taking advantage of his kind permission given me the preceding day. Such a step, I afterwards plainly saw, would have been the worst we could have taken; for once housed, however huddled together \(M. Forcade had then only a single room and a cabin\), the officials would have gladly seen both parties as uncomfortable as possible; and never have made the slightest effort to accommodate us; or suppose they were indeed capable of a shadow of hospitality, we should have been obliged to accept thankfully the meanest hovel they might have fell disposed to pick out for us.

"As it was, we rowed in quite another direction, following the natives to Napha \(M. Forcade lived in a village called Tumai\), and arrived with them at a spot called Tundo, just at the entrance of the junk-harbour where, as we now know, it was impossible for them to stop. Thus the onus fell on them to try by all means to get us to go to another place; so that we could, as we really did, stand out for a good residence by mere passive continuance where we were. Some slight resistance was made to landing our goods; part of them were actually plunged into the sea during the pushing to and fro; but as it did not amount to more than a vain attempt, I found it best to leave it entirely to the heroism of the second mate while I went twice more to and from the ship, tilt all things were landed. I then brought my family and straightway proceeded with them to the temple. Arrived there, we were immediately waited upon by a great number of officers. The table being served, the parley recommenced; it seemed to me never to end. At last, the Governor of Napha came; but as I could not know at all how to compliment either in the Chinese or another manner, I found it best to continue unmoved in the stern oriental dignity I soon perceived it was best to assume and keep up till at least a concession as to residence was made us."

The Governor at first was not inclined to grant any favours; but Dr. Bettelheim says that on seeing him getting ready to withdraw:

"I expressed astonishment at his omitting to order my things to he removed from the beach, intimating at the same time that I held him responsible for any damage happening to them,. . . and, though we had a great number of boxes and packages, in less than a quarter of an hour all were in the yard."

The next day Dr. Bettelheim was presented with a document to the following effect:

"A duly prepared petition, Hiang Yungpau, the Treasurer of the Department of Chungshan in the Kingdom of Loochoo hereby earnestly begs you not to stop in these quarters in order to tranquilise this little region. The report of Ching Liangpeh, the local magistrate of Napha, states as follows: 'that the English physician Bettelheim told me with his own mouth: "if your honourable country will let me come ashore, the ship will immediately leave, &c." Having reflected that the said Bettelheim had brought with him his wife and children, and that having been a long time at sea they must be suffering both in body and mind, my heart could hardly bear to refuse him to land as he requested. But an examination of our laws and regulations shows that there is none for permitting persons or officers from another country to land with the intention of remaining. I repeatedly and decidedly begged to decline his request, but he would not hear to it, and brought his wife and children ashore with the intention of stopping. As is right, I clearly inform you of these things.'

"On receiving this, I again examined and ascertained that our Government has hitherto strictly forbidden foreigners of all ranks to come ashore to live. How much more, too, since this country has such insignificant limits, the ground everywhere so impoverished and poor, and the productions so inconsiderable; it can scarcely be called a country. If foreigners dwell here, truly it will not be convenient. But year before last, a French ship came in, whose captain stated 'that after a few months a ship of a high commander would arrive, and that in the meantime he wished to leave an agent and an interpreter with him to explain matters better.' As soon as I heard this, I explained the matter and firmly refused his request; but the captain would not listen to me and sailed away leaving behind the two individuals. I, the Treasurer, could do no other way, and here they have been left to stop till this time. Now in the opinion of this Government, since these two men came till now, both officers and people, seeing that they constantly attended to their own matters, have each been confined to their own business and station. But in this miserable region, the present year has been one of extraordinary dearth, so that the whole population has been greatly straitened and obliged to feed upon wild pineapples to keep alive. Truly I fear that before long the scarcity will become alarming and we shall be upon the borders of starvation. I am now anxiously awaiting the arrival of the high French commander, when I shall state the circumstances of the case and again earnestly beg him to take these two men home with him.

"But, sir, if you now persist in stopping here, the distress of rulers and people will become more aggravated, and the country surely will never be able to stand it. I humbly beg you to have some consideration for this distressed, worn-out country; look down on us with magnanimity, be humane and compassionate. Give up the design of stopping in this land; wait till wind and weather be favourable, then embark in the same ship and sail back to your country. This is what I anxiously hope and look for you to do."

Few missionaries at the present day would justify the way in which Dr. Bettelheim pushed himself into a country where evidently it was only fear of the military power of England that prevented the officials from using the most summary methods for keeping him out. The Kingdom of God is not to he built up by disregard of the rights of others, and it may be questioned whether its progress was not retarded rather than hastened by what was done in Loochoo. Dr. Bettelheim, however, was persistent. He says that he contented himself by sending a good present instead of any direct answer. A showy American clock seemed to be especially acceptable to the officer. The ship soon sailed away, and Dr. Bettelheim was asked to look at a house that had been chosen for his residence. It was so dark, damp, and small that he refused to accept it. Accordingly a large but dilapidated temple was assigned to him. Five Loochooans, to whom was given the name of "interpreters," were lodged in the same building, while three huts were built in the courtyard, each to contain five men, stationed there, it was said, to guard the missionary's property.

When Dr. Bettelheim offered to put his knowledge of medicine at the disposal of the Loochooans, an official communication from the Government declared the country to be so well supplied with medicines and physicians that his help would not be required. His offers to teach English, geography, and astronomy, were likewise declined.

Dr. Bettelheim entered earnestly upon the task of learning the language. He soon rendered into the Loochooan dialect some prayers from Dr. Morrison's Chinese translation of the English liturgy. He says that as he daily read these at family worship he was audibly followed by the native servants. He also composed some sermons which he committed to memory. He writes of his early attempts at preaching:

"Crowds gathered and were permitted to gather round me wherever I raised my humble pulpit upon a stone, in the corner of a street, in the market, in the roads or lanes, in Shui or in Napha; no matter where I halted, there all the passers-by stopped, the inhabitants of the neighbourhood opened their houses and slipped out, all of them, men, women, children; the stalls were idle, sellers and buyers forgot their trade while apparently engaged in a higher business."

M. Leturdu, who says that the French missionaries made no attempt at public preaching, writes of Dr. Bettelheim:

"It has often happened that when he was preaching to a circle of hearers and just as he reached the most heated part of his discourse, an official would give a whistle. At that instant half of the circle of those before whom he spoke would turn half way round to the right so as to present their backs to him. At a second signal the other half would execute a similar movement to the left. Thus the poor preacher found himself surrounded by persons of whom he could see only their backs. If he complained, the officers would reply with a sober countenance that the people were showing him the greatest possible politeness, since they thus expressed to him that they considered themselves unworthy to look upon his face. People have gone so far as to put buckets of filth at his feet while he was speaking."\*

In October, 1847, the King of Loochoo died, and from that time the treatment accorded to Dr. Bettelheim was more unfriendly. On the day of the funeral, as he was walking with two French missionaries, they were assaulted with sticks and stones. Afterwards the attendants tried to keep him from having intercourse with the people. He writes:

"It took a year of persevering opposition, now hidden, now open, to enable even a despotic cabal like that we had fallen under since the King's death to bring about a total desertion of the places where I halted and of the streets and lanes I passed through. First, there was a bustle, a running here and there, a rattling and clapping of shutting doors and windows, as if a devil had come in their way; greengrocers deserted their stalls, labourers ceased their work, and crews left their boats; women dragged their children in-doors in such haste and fright as to make them scream out when they saw me again."

As the houses were shut against him, he tried another expedient;

"Rolls of portions of Scriptures and of tracts in the Chinese, and addresses written in the Loochooan—copies of which my good wife busily helped me to multiply during late night hours—were the only missiles I threw into the besieged courts; but, alas\! what I strewed with difficulty and hazard for many months was easily gathered by the vigilant enemy and brought back to me, a large trunkful, by government emissaries. My chief pulpit, the great market of Napha, where I knew they could not long go on driving off buyer and seller, and where my charities to a few cripples waiting there for alms had evidently made a good impression on the multitude, was certainly not forsaken; but no sooner did a man or woman look up to the speaker than a hint, a yell, or a pull from somewhere, was sure to sink the daring eyes to the ground."

Later experiences are recorded in the following extracts:

"To the rolls of tracts which I colported through the streets I added a good bagful of cakes. . . Those who refused a tract were frequently less rigorous toward my cakes. . . . Even after my hawking stratagems had been out-manœuvred by the vigilance of the enemy who countermined all my efforts, and nobody cared either for my tracts, or my bag, or my cakes; a few naked, sun-browned little ones still remained my customers; and observing that the dark of the evening gave the spies less play-ground, I chose this time to go out into the byways and hedges where tawny children presently hopped to and from me in considerable numbers, of course with the natural desire of getting a cake or some cash, but now and then they got something better, a grain of sweet, heavenly manna, or a shekel out of the sanctuary. No wonder a stop should be put to such delightful rambles."

Shut out entirely from street labour nothing remained but boldly to venture into people's houses.....How I felt the first time I found myself within a Loochooan house can be better imagined than described; but as I counted the cost beforehand and was prepared even for a 'Get thee behind me\! Get thee hence\!' or something still more forcible than words, nothing new could well befall me. I was little moved with the cries of the women or frightened at the screams of the children, but seated myself in the first room I could get access to. You will perhaps ask in surprise at the outset how I could gain access into houses whose doors a well-trained body of spies would certainly take the precaution to have shut The answer is simple, I did not enter by the door, at least in most cases, for I could not, but found my way through the deep gaps in dilapidated back walls. I might say I have done some service to the masons in this way and perhaps to the owners too, for by and by the former got more work and the latter got their walls repaired; this whole practice of getting in through such an opening at the back, at first considered here no more irregular than it would be in villages at home to get over a fence or a hedge, came by and by into disuse."

"In the beginning of my visits to these dwellings I rather selected the respectable part of the population, and met with astonishingly good reception. After the first surprise and confusion occasioned by my sudden appearance was over, one or other of the family, and sometimes even the master, kept me company and was sure to hear the message of salvation, as I was watching my time and gave my visit a professional turn as soon as I could. But invariably the second or third visit to the same house found matters altered. In some instances I was plainly forbidden the house. In some, all the inmates ran off. In others, the master told me if I had compassion upon them, I would not expose them to the dangers they ran in letting me enter their doors. Not very long ago, in three instances, I had hairbreadth escapes from a good beating."

He would sometimes hide in a thicket until evening, and then suddenly rush to the crowded market-place.

"Surprise has tamed the enemy—so I thought—and I am granted half an hour to address the wondering multitude. But the enemy is not tame; he is on the alert, and if there is a pause of half an hour, it is used to gather the troop, and on they come, bearing long and heavy bamboos, striking upon the naked bodies of the people as if they were a mass of cattle and crying out, 'Why did you not run?\! Why did vou not run?' thus betraying all the more plainly that it is they who teach the people to flee from us as before wild beasts."

In 1850 the Bishop of Victoria visited Loochoo. He found that the people were prevented from seeking medical aid from Dr. Bettelheim or otherwise having anything to do with him. This, however, did not seem to be because of hatred towards Christianity, but because of fear that Japan would visit its displeasure on Loochoo if it showed itself friendly to foreigners. On the other hand, there was fear that the British Government would resent any ill treatment of its subjects.

At the time of the Bishop's visit, he was ill for a few days. This filled the officials with apprehension lest he should be left with diem. The Vice-Governor, therefore, sent a letter to the captain of the naval vessel that had brought him, saying rumours had come that certain persons requiring medical aid had slept at Dr. Bettelheim's residence. The letter continued:

"Now if this should lead to their permanently remaining here, it would cause much uneasiness. Our humble country is poor and the few sorts of grain which we grow are scanty. During the period of Bettelheim's residence here, all of us, from the highest to the lowest classes, have been constantly occupied in business concerning him, so as to be unable to attend to our vocations, which exposes us to severe want. If still more persons remain here, our troubles will be greatly increased, so that the nation will assuredly be unable to subsist."

The letter also speaks of the undesirability of having any other religion than Confucianism taught:

"Besides, our gentry, as well as the common people, are without natural capacity and, although they have attended exclusively to Confucianism, they have as yet been unable to arrive at perfection. If they should now also have to study in addition the religion of the Lord of Heaven, such an attempt would surpass our ability, and the heart does not incline to it,"

A letter written not long after this by Mrs. Bettelheim tells of her husband's having been thrown out of a house and left lying for some time senseless on the ground. Even after she came, the people were afraid to help him. They were beaten back by the officers, who after considerable delay got two men to carry him home.

In a letter written in 1851, Dr. Bettleheim speaks of having translated Luke, John, Acts, and Romans. He tells the story of a young man whom he speaks of as the nephew and namesake of a professor of Christianity whose fate is recorded in the reports of the Loochoo Mission. The young man had formerly been one of the guards. One day, as Dr. Bettelheim and his wife were passing along the street, they heard their names called and found this man bound to a heavy beam in such a way that he could not change his position. He had been beaten over the head with a stick. Insufficient food, and that of a poor quality, was given to him. This treatment was because he had declared his belief in Christianity. He repeated several passages from one of the books he had studied while acting as guard. When Dr. Bettelheim offered to loosen the stocks that fastened his feet, and thus to give him relief, at least while they were with him, the captive refused, saying that, since his stepfather had confined him in that way, he would not be so unfilial as to rebel.

A month passed before they could again get access to the prisoner, who was then much weaker than before. He said that he had been declared insane and that punishments called "remedies for bringing him to his senses" were regularly inflicted. A month later he had disappeared, the stepfather saying that he had been sent elsewhere to recover from illness. Dr. Bettelheim asked that some books be sent to the young man for his consolation; but to this proposition the stepfather replied: "These books were declared to be the cause and the proof of his madness. How then can I dare accept them?" Not long after this, Dr. Bettelheim was told that the young man was dead.

### THE OPENING OF THE GATES   1853-1859





AT last the time had come for Japan to he drawn forth from its long seclusion. The way in which this was accomplished by Commodore Perry has often been described, and here we need concern ourselves with only such particulars as have a direct connection with our subject.

When it became known that the United States was fitting out an expedition to Japan, great interest was aroused among those who hoped that among its results would be the opening of the land to the Gospel. One young man, Jonathan Goble, joined the force of marines for the purpose of gaining such knowledge of Japan as would help in future attempts at its evangelisation. During the last part of the outward voyage he had an opportunity to begin missionary work by instructing a Japanese who was one of a crew of shipwrecked sailors picked up by an American ship and sent to China. When Commodore Perry offered to take these sailors to their own country, only one of them accepted the offer. The sailors gave him the nickname "Sam Patch," by which he was known to foreigners through the remainder of his life. In the account of the expedition Commodore Perry says:

"One of the marines named Goble, a religious man, had taken a special interest in him; finding in his docility and intelligence promise of good fruit from a properly directed religious training. Goble had begun with him a system of instruction which he hoped would not only make the Japanese a fair English scholar, but a faithful Christian. Sam came to the United States in the *Mississippi*, and accompanied his benevolent shipmate and devoted teacher to his home in the interior of New York."\*

Dr. S. Wells Williams, whose association with shipwrecked Japanese had given him opportunities to gain some knowledge of their language, and whose acquaintance with Chinese ideographs could also be utilised, accepted with some misgivings the office of interpreter to the expedition. It may be that some of the Christian literature prepared by the aid of the shipwrecked Japanese was taken by him or others; for Spalding in his account of the expedition says that "some, temporarily connected with the squadron, distributed 'Yesoo' or religious tracts among the people during our stay, which was not adventitous \[*sic*\] for our objects." The narrative does not make clear whether this distribution was in Loochoo or in Japan proper.\*

While the expedition was in Loochoo, Dr. Bettelheim aided in the preparation of documents that were to be used in Japan, To show his appreciation of this help, the Commodore offered to repair the house in which Dr. Bettelheim lived, and for this purpose sent a company of men on shore. These persons procured some liquor and became so unruly that they did more harm than good to the building. The work was then put in Mr. Goble's care. His faithfulness in this and other tasks led Commodore Perry to offer him promotion. Mr. Goble said that instead of this he would like to be allowed, on reaching Japan, to go ashore whenever there was an opportunity to do so. His request was granted, and by simply giving notice to his superior officer he could visit the shore at almost any time when a boat was going. The knowledge of the country thus obtained he utilised in the preparation of lectures that he afterwards gave in America and England. A few years later, as we shall sec, Mr. Goble went to Japan as a missionary.

It was well understood that the prejudices of the Japanese against Christianity would add to the difficulties of negotiating a treaty with them. In the directions sent by President Fillmore to the Secretary of the Navy it was said:

"The deep-seated aversion of this people to hold intercourse with Christian nations is said to be owing chiefly to the indiscreet zeal with which the early missionaries, particularly those of Portugal, endeavoured to propagate their religion. The Commodore will therefore say that the Government of this country, unlike those of every other Christian country, does not interfere with the religion of its own people, much less with that of other nations,"

The President's letter to the "Emperor of Japan" touched upon the same point:

"The Constitution and laws of the United States forbid all interference with the religious or political concerns of other nations, I have particularly charged Commodore Perry to abstain from every act which could possibly disturb the tranquillity of your Imperial Majesty's dominions."

The reality of the Japanese prejudice was manifested when the treaty came to be signed. The English version bears the date, "This thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, and of Kayei the seventh year, third month, and third day;" but the Japanese version omits the former of these two ways of designating time. Dr. Williams says in his journal:

"Upon my desiring them to sign and date their copy, a difficulty arose, for they would only affix the date in Kayei's name and year, while I required both their term and ours, as in the Dutch \[version of the treaty\]; they declined to write the characters for 'our Lord Jesus Christ,' and the Commodore allowed this omission."\*

Spalding says that when some of the Japanese and Americans were exchanging autographs, he requested one of the former to write his name on the title-page of a Book of Common Prayer, which happened to have a steel engraving of the Cross upon it. "He had dipped his camel's-hair pencil into his portable inkstand, passed the point through his lips, and was about to write, when his eyes rested upon the cross; he instantly shook his head, threw the book upon the table, nor could he be induced to touch it again."

The first two days after the American fleet reached Uraga, some of the Japanese officials had been allowed to come on board the flag-ship. The next day was Sunday, and when a boat containing several people of high rank came from the shore, they were informed that no visitors could be received on that day, which was one observed by Americans for the worship of God. The hymn appropriately chosen for the morning service was that commencing:
> "Before Jehovah's awful throne,  
Ye nations bow with sacred joy;> Know that the Lord is God alone;  
He can create, He can destroy."\*
"With the aid of many of the fine voices of the crew and the assistance of the brass instruments of the band, in sight of heathen temples, and perhaps in the hearing of their worshipers, swelled up 'Old Hundred' like a deep diapason of old ocean." Thus did America call upon Japan, not only to have friendly relations with Western nations, but also to know and serve the Lord.

Commodore Perry was not always so careful in his observance of the Sabbath as this incident might lead us to suppose. Dr. Williams at another time wrote in his journal:

"Although to-day is Sunday, there is little cessation from work or business, and if God adds His blessing and enables us to carry out the design of the expedition, it will not be because or in answer to our prayers or regard to Him, but because we are used as Nebuchadnezzar the ax-helve was, to carry out that which falls in with His plans. In fact, no regard seems to be paid here to whatever scruples a man may have about working on the Sabbath. . . . God's day, and by consequence His law, is made subordinate to the will of one man."\*

Afterwards when Townsend Harris refused to transact business on the Sabbath, the Japanese urged "that when Commodore Perry was here, he made no difference for Sunday."†

Whatever inconsistency there may have been in Commodore Perry's behaviour, he was not indifferent to the influence that his work would have upon the religious history of Japan. In a paper read in 1856, before the American Geographical Society, he said:

"Though a sailor from boyhood, yet I may be permitted to feel some interest in the work of enlightening heathenism and imparting a knowledge of that revealed truth of God, which I fully believe advances man's progress here and gives him his only safe ground of hope for hereafter. To Christianise a strange people, the first important step should be to gain their confidence and respect by means practically honest and in every way consistent with the precepts of our holy religion."‡

Not only were religious services held upon the vessels of the fleet, but Christian funeral rites were performed upon the land. The first death occurred in Yokohama. The Japanese proposed that the body be sent to Uraga, whence they would take it by junk to Nagasaki for burial in a cemetery set apart for the interment of foreigners. They soon yielded, however, to Commodore Perry's remonstrances, and permitted the burial to be in Yokohama. Mr. Jones, the Chaplain, being in doubt as to whether the Japanese would allow Christian services to proceed without molestation, "asked the Commodore for directions, and was told, 'Do exactly as you always do on such occasions, no more, nor no less;' and in answer to his inquiry how he should act if interrupted, the answer was, 'Still go on and have your usual service.' No opposition, however, was made, and the Chaplain felt that it was a day to be remembered that, after the lapse of centuries, a minister of Christ stood, in his own person, upon the soil of Japan and unmolested performed one of the rites of his faith." In describing the ceremony, Mr. Jones says that the company was received, on landing, by the Mayor of Uraga and his attendants.

"I had expected that on their seeing me in my official costume and first knowing that there was a Christian minister on their shore and among them that there would be a recoil and that they would shrink from me as from something poisonous; but there was no such thing. On the contrary, they came up successively and gave me their hands for a shake. \(They have learned our salutation and seem to be fond of it.\) The interpreter, pointing to my prayer-book, asked if it were for ceremonies over the dead, and smiled as before when I told him that it was....Our way led through the village, and the occasion seemed to excite quite a holiday among them; everybody, men, women, and children, running and gaining good places for seeing, and squatting down on the ground till we had passed, when they would run and gain another place for observation if they could. . . . They had selected for the interment a very pretty spot about a hundred yards from the village and closely adjoining an old burying-ground of their own. We found the Buddhist priest seated there, but he attempted no interference with our religious ceremonies."

This priest remained during the Christian service, and at its close performed the rites of his own religion; beating a gong, burning incense, and reading prayers.\*

Chaplain Jones's views concerning the possibilities of missionary work were expressed as follows:

"Apart from governmental influence, I think there would be no great difficulty in introducing Christianity, *but the Government would interfere most decidedly.* I performed funeral services on shore four times; once at Yokohama, twice at Hakodate, and once at Shimoda; in every instance in the presence of the Japanese, and in most when large numbers were collected. They always behaved well. Japanese officers were present, with their insignia, on all occasions, I thus became known among the people everywhere as a *Christian clergyman;* or, to follow their signs for designating me, as 'a praying man.' Instead of this producing a shrinking from me, as I had supposed it would, I found that I had decidedly gained by it in their respect, and this among officials as well as commoners. At our last visit to Shimoda we found a new governor. . . . At the bazaar, amid the buying, etc., I was led up to him by one of the officials and introduced *as a clergyman.* The Governor's countenance brightened up as my office was announced, and his salutation and treatment of me became additionally courteous. I mention this, however, for what it may be worth. There was no seeming aversion to me because I was a minister of Christianity. The Government, however, beyond all doubt, is exceedingly jealous about our religion; but the Japanese officials as well as the people are so inquisittive and so observant of all that comes within their reach that, doubtless, after a time, they may be brought to see the difference between ourselves and the Romanists. Against the latter they have a deep-seated dislike. Until they do understand that difference, no form of Christianity can probably get foothold in Japan."\*

Mr. Jones found an opportunity to give a little information about his religion:

"One of the priests approached, and, pointing to an image, asked Mr. Jones what it was called in America. He answered; *'Nai.*' 'We have it not.' He then pointed to the altars and asked the same Question, to which he received the same reply. When the Chaplain left the temple, as he walked on, his official attendant asked him if the people prayed in America. He was answered in the affirmative, and Mr, Jones, dropping on one knee, joined his hands and, with upturned face, closed his eyes and pointed to the heavens to intimate by signs that we pray to a being there. He then asked his attendants if they prayed to that being. He replied:—'Yes, we pray to *Tien,'* their word for heaven or God."†

While Commodore Perry was in Japan, Rev. E. H. Moreton came to Loochoo to take the place of Dr. Bettelheim. Spalding describes him as "a pleasant-voiced little preacher, with mild face and cockney aspiration of the letter H." He was accompanied by his wife and child. Dr. Bettelheim's family had been sent to China, and the Loochooan officials begged that they might also be relieved of him and Mr. Moreton. In a petition addressed to Commodore Perry they wrote:

"In the year 1844 and 1846 some French officers came, and the Englishman Bettelheim also brought hither his wife and children to reside, and they all required something to be daily given them, to our continual annoyance and trouble. Whenever an English or French ship came in, we earnestly represented these circumstances to them and besought them to take these people away with them. The Frenchmen, knowing our distresses, went away in the year 1848 to their own country and have not hitherto returned; but Bettelheim has loitered away years here and not gone; and now, further, has brought Moreton with his family to take his place and live here, greatly to the discomfort of the people, and distress and inconvenience of the country. We have learned that your excellency has authority over all the East Indian, China, and Japan seas, and not a ship of any Western country can go from one of these seas to the other but you know and regulate its movements. Therefore we lay before you our sad condition in all its particulars, humbly beseeching your kind regard upon it, and requesting that, when your fine ships return, you will take both Bettelheim and Moreton away with you. This will solace and raise us up from our low condition, and oblige us in a way not easy to be expressed."\*

It had already been arranged that Dr. Bettelheim should be given passage to China; but the Loochooans had to endure the presence of his successor for two years, after which the latter also withdrew with shattered health. In 1860, the English Bishop of Victoria wrote:

"Since the close of 1855 no Protestant missionary has occupied that post; and in the face of the continued persistency of the Loochooan authorities in this course of passive resistance to all missionary efforts, it has been deemed inexpedient, if not impossible, to renew the mission. Besides, it was felt that the Japanese Government or \(more accurately speaking\) the agents of the Prince of Satsuma exerted an all-powerful control over this subject dependency, and that a continuance of the mission under such exceptional circumstances was to expose the local authorities themselves to severe punishment by their Japanese conquerors."

Dr. Bettelheim went to the United States, where he tried in vain to secure such funds as would enable him to undertake work in the main islands of Japan. In a statement published April 5, 1855, in the *Independent \(*New York\), he said: "There are a goodly number of believers in Loochoo, four of whom I baptised."

The treaty made by Commodore Perry did not give foreigners the right to reside in Japan, and the country was still closed to missionary efforts; yet it was evident that what had been accomplished must lead, sooner or later, to a complete opening of the doors, and the missionary societies eagerly awaited further developments. In 1855, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, asked one of its missionaries in China to visit Japan and make such investigations as should prepare the way for future operations. Failure to obtain passage from Shanghai prevented the person appointed from making the visit.\*

The treaty provided for the appointment by the United States of a consul, who should reside in Shimoda. The first person to hold this position was Townsend Harris. He arrived at his post in 1856. To him was entrusted the task of negotiating a new treaty that should carry one step further what had been done by Commodore Perry. The results showed that he was eminently fitted for this duty. Professor Nitobe says:

"If 'an ambassador,' according to Wotton's definition, 'is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the commonwealth,' Harris was no diplomat. If, on the contrary, an American minister to an oriental court is a representative of the moral principles of the great Christian republic, Harris deserves the name in its best sense."†

Dr. S. Wells Williams speaks of Mr. Harris as "Truly a Christian man," and says, "His success is better explained if the fact be known that it was in answer to prayer."‡

Mr. Harris's journals give abundant proof that he did not conceal his religion; and some of the entries, as the following, deserve a place in a history of Christianity in Japan.

"Sunday, August 24, 1856. Do not leave the ship. In the afternoon the Japanese come off and desire to see me. I decline either to see them or to hear their messages, for the reason that it is Sunday. They urge me at least to hear their message, saying that it is very important and from the Governor. They also say that when Commodore Perry was here, he made no difference for Sunday, etc., etc. I adhere to my previous determination, telling them through Mr. Heusken that they can come off to-morrow morning as early as they please, and then state their message."\*

"Sunday, August 31, 1856. . . . Japanese come off to sec me. I refuse to see any one on Sunday. I am resolved to set an example of a proper observance of the Sabbath by abstaining from all business or pleasures on that day. I do not mean I should not take a quiet walk or any such amusement. I do not mean to set an example of Puritanism, but I will try to make it what I believe it was intended to be, a day of rest."†

In December, 1856, the ratified treaties between Russia and Japan were to be exchanged, and Harris was invited to assist in the ceremonies. His chief reason for refusing was that the day fixed for the exchange was Sunday. He wrote in his journal:

"From the time of my arrival I have refused to attend to any kind of business on that day; and after a short time the Japanese ceased to ask it of me. Should I now join the Russians, I shall contradict all my previous acts on this account, and lose my character for *consistency,* a point that cannot be too carefully watched in dealing with people like the Japanese."‡

The journals often speak of his reading the Episcopal service, having Mr. Heusken, his interpreter, for "clerk and congregation." Sunday, December 6, 1857, was spent in Yedo, and he wrote:

"This is the second Sunday in Advent; assisted by Mr. Heusken, I read the full service in an audible voice, and with the paper doors of the house here our voices could be heard in every part of the building. This was beyond doubt the first time that the English version of the Bible was ever read or the American Protestant Episcopal service ever repeated in this city. What a host of thoughts rush upon me as I reflect on this event. Two hundred and thirty years ago, a law was promulgated in Japan inflicting death on any one who should use any of the rites of the Christian religion in Japan, That law is still unrepealed, and yet I have boldly and openly done the very acts that the Japanese law punishes so severely\!. . . The first blow is now struck against the cruel persecution of Christianity by the Japanese, and, by the blessing of God, if I succeed in establishing negotiations at this time with the Japanese, I mean to boldly demand for the Americans the free exercise of their religion in Japan, with the right to build churches, and I will also demand the abolition of the custom of trampling on the cross or crucifix, which the Dutch have basely witnessed for two hundred and thirty years without a word of remonstrance. This custom has been confined to Nagasaki; had it been attempted at Shimoda, I should have remonstrated in a manner that would have compelled the Japanese to listen to me. I shall be both proud and happy if I can be the humble means of once more opening Japan to the blessed rule of Christianity."\*

A week later, after speaking of a similar service, he added: "I have told the Japanese that I performed my religious worship, in order that they may not say they had no knowledge of it."†

At a later date Mr. Harris sometimes had fellow-worshippers. A writer in the New York *Journal of Commerce* tells of a service held Sunday, August I, 1858, and attended by the officers and crews of the United States ships *Powhatan* and *Mississippi.* It was at Shimoda in the house occupied by the Consul-General. This was a temple, and the images, which had been removed from their usual place, were ranged about the walls of the room.

"Strangely our Americans were assembled in an idol's temple to celebrate Christian worship for the first time since Christianity was extirpated by fire and sword, and Protestant worship for the first time since the Advent\! The Bible was read, prayers were offered, a sermon was preached, and the sweet hymns of Zion were sung in tunes not less sweet or sacred, familiar to every one from childhood, but never so sweet and touching as when sung for the first time in Japan and poured out in this old heathen temple."‡

The writer of this account was, doubtless, Rev. Henry Wood, Chaplain of the *Powhatan,* who, we learn from other sources, conducted the service. One writer says:

"The house was surrounded by hundreds of Japanese anxiously watching what was going on. Inside of the house were several \(six\) Christian Japanese who had for some time been converted from heathenism."§

Chaplain Wood states that Mr. Harris showed him his letter of instructions from Mr. Marcy, the American Secretary of State, in which Mr. Harris was directed "to do his best, by all judicious measures and kind influence, to obtain the full toleration of the Christian religion in Japan, and protection for all missionaries and others who should go there to promulgate it." Apparently there was some misunderstanding here, for, whatever may have been written in persona\! letters, the only passage in the official instructions that bore upon the subject was the remark: "The intolerance of the Japanese in regard to the Christian religion forbids us to hope that they would consent to any stipulation by which missionaries would be allowed to enter that empire, or Christian worship, according to the form of any sect, would be permitted."\*

Whatever may have been the doubts of his superior concerning the possibility of obtaining any concession, Mr. Harris, as we have already seen, resolved to make the attempt; and his efforts were crowned with success, the eighth article of the treaty that he concluded providing that:

"Americans in Japan shall be allowed the free exercise of their religion, and for this purpose shall have the right to erect suitable places of worship. No injury shall be done to such buildings, nor any insult be offered to the religious worship of the Americans.

"American citizens shall not injure any Japanese temple or *miya,* or offer any insult or injury to Japanese religious ceremonies, or to the objects of their worship.

"The Americans and Japanese shall not do anything that may be calculated to excite religious animosity. The Government of Japan has already abolished the practice of trampling on religious emblems."†

This treaty, which was signed in July, 1858, provided that certain ports should be available for the residence of American citizens; some of them to be open July 4, 1859, and others at later dates. The treaties that Japan subsequently made with England, France, and other nations were modelled upon this one. They did not give permission for preaching Christianity to the Japanese, and it is said that the endeavour of some of the foreign ambassadors to have an article to this end inserted, was obstinately resisted.\* Yet there was reason to believe that, if missionaries availed themselves of the liberty to reside in Japan, they would find opportunities for teaching their religion to the people. An officer of the United States Navy had already, in 1857, written from Hakodate, expressing the opinion that the time had come for sending missionaries—prudent men, of tried experience —who "must remember that it is death to a Japanese to become a Christian," and must not "rush headlong into the work without considering secondary means;" but who, if judicious, would probably "meet with as much encouragement as they generally do when first commencing operations in heathen lands."†

Some of the missionaries in China visited Japan in order to see what openings there might be. Among these, in 1858, was Dr. S. Wells Williams. He says:

"I was much impressed with what Mr, Donker Curtius, the Dutch envoy, who had just signed a treaty, then said; that the Japanese officials had told him they were ready to allow foreigners all trading privileges if a way could be found to keep opium‡ and Christianity out of the country. There were also then at Nagasaki Rev. Mr. Syle and Chaplain Henry Wood, and we three agreed to write to the directors of the Episcopal, Reformed, and Presbyterian Mission Boards, urging them to appoint missionaries for Japan who could teach the people what true Christianity was. Within the coming year we all had the pleasure of meeting the agents of these three societies In Shanghai."\*

Mr. Syle wrote to the Missionary Board of the American Episcopal Church that he saw six young men belonging to the Governor's staff, who were "gathered round the Rev. Mr. Wood, Chaplain of the *Powhatan,* who had been invited to become their instructor during his stay in the port." Captain Nicolson of the *Mississippi* mentioned having had three classes for the instruction of Japanese during his stay in Hakodate. Dr. Williams addressed a letter to Mr. Syle, in which he suggested that the best way to commence mission work would be to place a missionary in Nagasaki or Yedo, who would offer to teach English on condition that he should be assisted to learn the Japanese language.

"This engagement may be entered into for two years at least, at the end of which time experience will prove the best guide to future operations. . . . If the mission he commenced by a discreet and patient man whose first object will be to teach his pupils to write and speak English, to whom is joined a physician whose object will be to practise gratuitously among the people at large and educate a few pupils in medicine and surgery, if they can he obtained, both of them full of love for souls and earnest in leading men to the Saviour, we may humbly look for their success."

At a lunch on one of the American vessels, Mr. Syle sat between the Vice-Governor and an interpreter. He says:

"They both expressed and repeated the wish that I might come here to reside and to teach English. If I could not stay now, would I not come over in the first ship? and when would that first ship come? I was assured that I should have a house, and that my wife and children would be welcome. I took pains to tell them I was a preacher and not merely a teacher, and promised that I would write to America and see what could be done to meet their wishes."†

Chaplain Wood found opportunities to speak to his pupils about the truths of Christianity. In a letter to the New York *Journal of Commerce* he speaks of the way in which he utilised the appearance of Donati's comet:

"When the comet appeared in such length and splendour above the western mountains, they contemplated the strange sight with admiration, but not with terror, though they had no science or theory to account for it. . . . Very naturally, and indeed almost inevitably, the comet became an associate teacher in my seminary, furnishing the opportunity I was seeking to discourse on the great theme of God and His character, which I was wishing to introduce, but not violently or in a way to create offence and distrust, remembering the place where I stood and its history. When questions were proposed about the comet, it was easy and natural to proceed from the effect to the cause and to discourse on the existence and character of God, and the origin, the extent, and the laws of the material creation. The absurdity and folly of idols and idol worship were then argued. . . . Not only did they take no offence, but they listened with attention and respect, and seemed to give their assent. At this stage I did not venture to refer to Christianity. . . . I waited till I had secured the confidence of the Governor and the confidence and, I may add, the affection of the young men, nor even then did I make an onslaught, but, as I before remarked, waited for incidents or inquiries which should make the religious turn of the instruction natural and inevitable, and throw the responsibility, if anywhere, upon the Japanese themselves. Soon an opportunity was presented by the questions asked by one of the students when the words *church, pulpit, organ,* and *choir* occurred in one of the reading lessons This led to the explanation of the form of church edifices, the Sabbath, public worship, the singing in the church, the construction of an organ and the manner of playing it, the preacher and what he preached, and the happy effects of preaching upon those who heard and obeyed it. Thus Christianity in all its doctrines was expounded *at their own request.*

"On another occasion the conversation turned upon the *soul,* which was explained as spiritual, imperishable, immortal. What then, they inquired, becomes of it when the body dies? 'God fakes the good,' it was replied, 'to heaven.' 'What is heaven?' they asked again. I explained, when they caught the idea and exclaimed, 'Paradise\! Paradise\!' The word had probably travelled down from the time of the Catholic missions. They next asked: 'What becomes of the bad men?' They go to a bad place where they are punished for their wicked deeds.' 'Is fire there?' they anxiously inquired, showing that either such an idea was entertained in their own religion or else had been handed down by the tradition of centuries. They were perplexed about the meaning of the word *God* which I used. I explained, going from effects to a cause, from the world to Him who made it, when one exclaimed in high excitement: 'The Creator\! The Creator\!' 'Yes, this God mack us, and cares for us, and pities us.' They themselves saw and knew that men are ignorant and wicked, and therefore God had sent Christ, His own Son, into the world to teach mankind and to save them. Interrupting me, one asked excitedly; 'Jesus Christ?' In some way he had heard and understood the *double* name, but hesitated when he heard the *single* term only. 'Yes, Jesus Christ,' I replied. 'He loved us; He pitied us; He came into the world to teach men to be good and show them how they could be happy when they die. But men were so wicked whom He came to make happy that they seized Him and put Him to death on the cross. He was buried, but He rose again.' All this amazed them, evidently awakening their sympathy, and at the same time their admiration."

Another early teacher of English was Dr. McGowan, of the Ningpo Mission of the American Baptist Union, who, on his way to America, reached Nagasaki in January, 1859, and remained there several weeks. He had a class of several young men who had been educated as interpreters of Chinese, and who now wished to learn English. Dr. McGowan's ability to talk with them in the former language opened the way for more familiar relations than would otherwise have been possible. In a letter he says:

"As soon as they were able to spell a few words, I presented each of them with copies of the New Testament in English and Chinese, which they gladly accepted for the use the volume would be in the acquisition of our language. Understanding Chinese perfectly, they could thereby get at much of the meaning of the English version of the sacred volume. But as nothing could be done without permission of the Governor, nor even spoken without his knowledge, his assent to the acceptance of the books was necessary. Assent was refused. My class would have imperilled their lives by retaining a page of the New Testament, a work expressly prohibited by name. The Scriptures were all returned to me, but copies of the newspaper that I had published in Chinese at Ningpo and had given away were retained and sought with avidity. A certain amount of religious matter will be tolerated in a book if it abound with what they consider useful knowledge and if the religious matter cannot be expurgated."

In a bookstore Dr. McGowan found a Japanese reprint of a book on the Law of Storms that he had published in China. In the original edition, after the author's name had been printed, "American Christian Physician"; but the Japanese had left out the ideographs for "Christian." Other works prepared in China gained considerable circulation in Japan. Dr. Mc-Gowan wrote;

"There are probably few if any books published by missionaries in China on secular affairs that have not been re-published by the knowledge-loving Japanese, The largest work of the kind is from the pen of the senior missionary in China, Dr. Bridgman,—a geographical and statistical account of America issued some twenty years ago. To that book the Japanese are indebted for their knowledge of our country—a knowledge so precise as to excite surprise."

He suggests that this work may have prepared the way for the success of Commodore Perry. As will be seen in a later chapter, Joseph Neesima was among those reading Dr. Bridgman's book about the time of which Dr. McGowan writes. He who would understand the causes that have produced the New Japan ought not to overlook the important preparatory work that was done by the missionaries in China in giving to the young men of the island empire so many new and inspiring ideas.

### THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MISSIONS IN JAPAN   1859-1873





EARLY in 1859, the Mission Board of the American Episcopal Church appointed Rev. John Liggins and Rev. C. M. Williams, both of whom were missionaries in China, to open work in Japan, "requesting them to remove to that empire, and to enter upon the missionary work there immediately after receiving these instructions."

When Mr. Liggins learned of this appointment, he was already in Japan, whither he had gone to recover from the effects of a fever and from injuries inflicted by a Chinese mob. He arrived at Nagasaki, May 2, 1859. This was two months before the provisions of the treaty permitted residence; but through the assistance of the United States Consul he secured permission to remain, and obtained a house in which to live. He was soon joined by Mr. Williams.

Mr. Liggins found that the teaching of English afforded one of the best opportunities for usefulness. He soon had a class of eight government interpreters. As the Christian Scriptures were prohibited, he thought that "missionaries must be content to circulate scientific works containing an admixture of Christianity." By August he had sold or given away one hundred and fifty copies of such books. He wrote:

"I look upon these geographical, historical, and scientific works prepared by the missionaries in Chinese as the pioneer literature for Japan; and as works in Chinese are understood by all well-educated Japanese, these works are destined to be eminently useful in doing away with this people's misconception of Christianity and thus preparing the way for the circulation of the Scriptures."

October 18, 1859, J. C. Hepburn. M.D., of the American Presbyterian Board, landed with his wife in Kanagawa; and in November, Rev. Samuel R. Brown and D. B. Simmons, M.D., both of the Reformed Church in America, reached the same port. Mr. Brown and Dr. Hepburn had, several years before this, been for short periods missionaries in China.

The three boards that had been urged by Dr. Williams, Mr. Syle, and Chaplain Wood, to begin work in Japan had thus quickly responded to the appeal. Dr. Williams afterwards wrote: "I do not know that better men could be found to begin missionary efforts than Brown, Hepburn, and Liggins."\*

One reason why it had been deemed appropriate that the Reformed \(Dutch\) Church in America should engage in this new enterprise, was because it was thought that it would be able to profit by the relations that had previously existed between Holland and Japan. This consideration made the missionary board of that church desire to send out some one whose birth in Holland made Dutch his mother tongue. Such a person was found in a young man named Guido F. Verbeck. who was about to graduate from the theological seminary in Auburn, N. Y. He accepted the invitation of the Reformed Board, accompanied Messrs. Brown and Simmons as far as Shanghai, and reached Nagasaki, November 7. The families of Messrs, Brown, Simmons, and Verbeck, remained for a while in Shanghai, whence they proceeded in December to Japan.

Though the names of some of the first missionaries will frequently appear in the following narrative, it may be well to add here a few notes concerning the six men to whom was given the honour of inaugurating the work of Protestant missions in Japan.

Rev, John Liggins was born at Nuneaton in Warwickshire, England, May 11, 1829. In 1841, he removed to Philadelphia, Pa. He graduated in 1855, from the Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Alexandria, Va. In November of the same year he sailed for China. The ill health that had led him to visit Japan permitted him to remain there only about ten months. Returning to America, he engaged in literary work. Among his publications were, "England's Opium Policy," "A Missionary Picture Gallery," and "The Great Value and Success of Foreign Missions." While in Nagasaki he prepared a book entitled "One Thousand Familiar Phrases in English and Japanese," which was the first book of the kind written in Japan.

Right Rev. Channing Moore Williams was born in Richmond, Va., July, 1829. He went to China at the same time with Mr, Liggins. In 1866, he was made Bishop of China and Japan. The growth of the work in the two countries, and the increasing difficulty of properly caring for so large a diocese, led to the appointment, in 1874, of another bishop for China, while Bishop Williams remained in Japan. In 1889. he resigned this charge, but continued in active work as a missionary until 1908, when he returned to America.

James Curtis Hepburn, M.D., LL.D., was born in Milton, Penn., March 13, 1815. He graduated from Princeton College in 1832, and from the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1836. In 1840, he married Miss Clara M. Leete. After graduation he practised medicine in America for a few years, and in 1841, went to Singapore as a medical missionary. Two years later he removed to Amoy. The ill health of Dr. and Mrs. Hepburn made it necessary to relinquish this work, and in 1846, they returned to America, settling in New York, where he established a lucrative practice. When Japan was opened, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions asked him to take up work in that land, and thus it was that, as we have seen, he went there in 1859. Hereafter there will be occasion to speak not only of his medical work, but also of his literary labours in the preparation of tracts, in the translation of the Scriptures, and in lexicography. In 1892, he retired from the work and returned to America. Perhaps no other missionary in Japan gained to so great a degree the esteem of all classes of people, Japanese and foreign. The *Japan Mail* spoke of him as "a man whose name will be remembered with respect and affection as long as Yokohama has annals. . . . The beauty of his character, his untiring charity, his absolute self-negation, and his steady zeal in the cause of everything good, constitute a picture which could not fail to appeal to the Japanese people." On his ninetieth birthday, in 1905, the Emperor of Japan conferred upon him the decoration of the Third Class of the Imperial Order of the Rising Sun.

Rev. Samuel Robins Brown, D.D., was born in East Windsor, Conn., June 16, 1810. His father was a carpenter; his mother wrote the well-known hymn, "I love to steal awhile away." While he was still young, his parents removed to Monson, Mass., where his childhood was spent. He graduated from Yale College in 1832. He was accepted by the American Board for service in China; but as lack of funds made it impossible to send him, he went in 1838 to that country as a teacher for the Morrison Education Society, which had been established there by Christian merchants. After eight years he returned to the United States on account of Mrs, Brown's poor health. He took with him for education in America three Chinese lads, one of them being Yung Wing, who afterwards did so much to promote education among his countrymen. Dr. Brown established a private academy in Owasco Outlet, N. Y., and also was pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in the same town. Going to Japan in 1859, he remained until 1879. He died at Monson, June 20, 1880. Besides other literary work, he was the chairman of the committee that had in charge the translation of the New Testament, and he shared with Drs. Hepburn and Greene the chief responsibility in that work. He will, however, be specially remembered as a teacher; for in Japan, as previously in China, he taught many young men who have since held prominent places in the religious, official, and business worlds. He inherited his mother's poetical genius, and was also a gifted musician. His biography has been published by Rev. W. E. Grif-fis, D.D., under the title, "A Maker of the New Orient."

D. B. Simmons, M.D., resigned from the mission of the Reformed Board in 1860. He continued to practise Medicine in Yokohama until 1882.

Rev. Guido Fridolin Verbeck, D.D., was born January 23, 1830, in Zeist, Province of Utrecht, Netherlands. His father was burgomaster of Zeist. The son was educated as a civil engineer, and about 1852 went to pursue his profession in America. Believing, after a time, that he was called to the ministry, he entered the Theological Seminary at Auburn, N. Y., where he graduated in 1859. In April of the same year he was married to Miss Maria Manton of Philadelphia, and soon after sailed from New York for Japan. Like the other early missionaries, he found that the teaching of English afforded the first opportunities for usefulness. His success with his pupils led to his being invited to take charge of an English school that the Government established in Nagasaki. With the consent of his Board, he accepted the position, and in 1869 removed to Tokyo, where for four years he was connected with what later became the Imperial University. During this period and afterwards, he was constantly called upon to advise the Government in educational matters. His connection with the Government continued until 1878. All of this time he continued to preach and engage in other forms of religious work. In 1877, he received the Third Class decoration of the Imperial Order of the Rising Sun. In 1891, the Government showed its further appreciation of what he had done by granting a special passport that gave him and his family the right to travel or reside in any part of Japan in the same manner as subjects of the country. One reason for this was that Dr. Verbeck was "a man without a country," having lost his citizenship in Holland and never having been naturalised in America. Hence, he could not claim protection from any foreign legation. After leaving the employ of the Government, he taught in a theological school, engaged in direct evangelistic work, and helped in the translation of the Scriptures. The excellent translation of the Palms is a monument to his industry and ability. He died March 10, 1898. The Emperor sent a gift of five hundred *yen* for the expenses of the funeral, which was attended by a representative of the Imperial Court and many other officials. The city government of Tokyo presented his family with a perpetual lease of the plot where his body was buried. Dr. Verbeck's biography has also been published by Dr. Griffis.

The wives of those of the above missionaries who were married deserve mention; but, as is so often the case, the materials for such notice are not easily found, and their work was not of such a kind as obtained much public record. Whatever success attended the labours of their husbands was doubtless due in large part to these noble women, and they should share with their husbands the honour that belongs to these missionary pioneers.

In a historical sketch prepared for the Missionary Conference held at Osaka in 1883, Dr. Verbeck quoted as follows from various reports that described the conditions under which the early missionaries laboured:

"The missionaries soon found that they were regarded with great suspicion and closely watched, and all intercourse with them was conducted under strict surveillance."

"No teacher could be obtained at Kanagawa until March, 1860, and then only a spy in the employment of the Government. A proposal to translate the Scriptures caused his frightened withdrawal."

"The efforts of the missionaries for several years, owing to the surveillance exercised by the Government, were mostly confined to the acquisition of the language."

"We found the natives not at all accessible touching religious matters. When such a subject was mooted in the presence of a Japanese, his hand would almost involuntarily be applied to his throat, to indicate the extreme perilousness of such a topic. If on such an occasion more than one happened to be present, the natural shyness of these people became, if possible, still more apparent; for you will remember that there was then little confidence between man and man, chiefly owing to the abominable system of secret espionage, which we found in full swing when we first arrived and, indeed, for several years after."

The missionaries shared with the other foreign residents in the alarms incident to a disturbed state of the country, and were sometimes exposed to insult and even to assault."

"The swaggering *samurai*, armed with two swords, cast many a scowling look at the hated foreigners, whom they would gladly have expelled from their sacred soil."

At first it was the common impression that the Japanese language could be easily learned. It was afterwards found to be one of the most difficult in the world. The colloquial language differs much from that used in books. The civilisation of old Japan came largely from China, and with it came the Chinese ideographs and a large number of words. Speaking roughly, it may be said that it was necessary to learn two ancient Chinese dialects in addition to the original Japanese language. The use of the ideographs was, indeed, a help to those who had learned them in China, while to others they added greatly to the difficulties of study. Dr. Hepburn has said that at first the only help possessed by the missionaries in the way of books was the vocabulary translated from the Dutch by Dr. Medhurst. After a while Hoffman's Grammar of the Japanese language was sent to them, a few leaves at a time. No teachers could be obtained, and so new words were picked up from servants, carpenters, visitors, and others. After a year, a man offered to teach Japanese in exchange for instruction in English. When, however, the translation of Matthew was begun, the man, after completing the first chapter, refused to do any more, saying that it would cost him his life.\*

Townsend Harris, who was now the United States Minister, continued to show a deep interest in Christian work. Dr. W. A. P. Martin, the well-known missionary in China, who visited Japan in 1859, wrote:

"Mr. Harris received of me more than one hundred geographies \(for which he paid\) for distribution among officials, and asked me to send him Bibles for the same purpose. Still he thinks it best for missionaries to confine themselves to the sale of books, as the only safe ground."

Dr. Martin himself has had no small part in the evangelisation of Japan. A book \("Tendosogen"\) on the evidences of Christianity, which he wrote for the Chinese, was among those early brought to Japan, where many thousand copies have been sold.

Mention has already been made of Mr. Jonathan Goble, who was a marine in Perry's expedition. On his return he lectured on Japan in America and England. After this, he spent some time in study and then, with his wife, went to Japan under the auspices of the American Baptist Free Mission Society,\* landing in Kanagawa April 1, 1860. The Southern Baptist Convention, in 1860, appointed three men as missionaries to Japan. Two of these—Rev. J. Q. Rohrer and Rev. A. L. Bond— with their wives, sailed from New York in a ship of which nothing more was ever heard. The third—Rev. C. H. Toy—afterwards became a Unitarian, and a professor in Harvard Divinity School, The breaking out of the Civil War in America prevented further attempts to establish this Mission.†

In 1861, the English Bishop of Victoria, who had recently visited Japan, wrote to the British and Foreign Bible Society that all the Protestant missionaries there concurred "in the view that it is highly impolitic and inexpedient in the present temper of the Japanese Government to attempt any distribution of a Japanese version of the Holy Scriptures among the people." He says that, "at first, both at Kanagawa and Nagasaki, efforts were made by the custom-house native authorities to compel the missionaries to deliver up all Christian books." Mr. Liggins, who was then in America, wrote in reply to the implication of these statements that he had sold, before the Bishop's visit, sixty copies of the Chinese Scriptures and books wholly religious, besides two thousand magazines, partly religious and partly secular. A letter from Mr. Verbeck to Mr. Liggins said: "I have lately sold sixty copies of a new work which contains a complete summary of Christian truth," while Mr. Brown wrote that he had sold two hundred copies of the New Testament. Mr. Liggins, after drawing attention to the fact that the American treaty allowed the Japanese to buy anything Americans might wish to sell, except opium and firearms, says that Mr. Harris told him that he had the "article worded as it is expressly to cover the sale of Scriptures and other Christian books by the missionaries, and that he should interfere at once if there were any attempt to violate it."

A letter written by Mr. Liggins in 1861, and published in *The Spirit of Missions,* gives a good summary of the situation in Japan at that time:

"As some persons, because Japan is not open to missionary labours to the extent they wish it was, speak as if it were not opened at all, it seems necessary to state what missionaries can do at the present time in that country.

"1. They can procure native books and native teachers by which to acquire the language, and of course, the acquisition of the language is, during the first few years, a principal part of their duty.

"2. They can, as they are able, prepare philological works to enable subsequent missionaries and others to acquire the language with much less labour and in much less time than they themselves have to give to it; and each, in the course of a few years, may make his contribution towards a complete version of the Holy Scriptures in the Japanese language.

"3. They can furnish the Japanese, who are anxious to learn English, with suitable books in that language, and thus greatly facilitate social and friendly intercourse between the two races.

"4. They can dispose by sale of a large number of the historical, geographical, and scientific works prepared by the Protestant missionaries in China. Faithful histories of Christian countries tend to disarm prejudice and to recommend the religion of the Bible; while works on true science are very useful in a country where astrology, geomancy, and many false teachings on scientific subjects generally, are so interwoven with their religious beliefs.

"5. They can sell the Scriptures, and religious books and tracts in the Chinese language, and thus engage in *direct* missionary work. As books in this language are understood by every educated Japanese, and as the sale of them is provided for by an article in the treaty, we have here a very available means of at once conveying religious truth to the minds of the Japanese.

"6. They can by their Christian walk and conversation, by acts of benevolence to the poor and afflicted, and by kindness and courtesy to all, weaken and dispel the prejudices against them, and convince the observant Japanese that true Christianity is something very different from what intriguing Jesuits of former days, and unprincipled traders and profane sailors of the present day, would lead them to think it is.

*"Living epistles* of Christianity are as much needed in Japan as written ones; and it would be very sad if either were withheld through a mistaken idea that Japan 'is not open to missionary labour.'

"Just after the signing of the Treaties, the statement of some was: 'Japan is fully opened to the spread of Christianity.' This the writer opposed at the time as contrary to the facts of the case; and he has now endeavoured to show that it is equally erroneous to assert, as some do. that it is not opened at all. What the writer has said on the subject is not the result of hearsay or of a flying visit to Japan; but of an experience in the work during the ten months that he resided in the country. This experience convinces him. that if missionaries faithfully embrace the openings which there are already, others will speedily be made: and the time will soon come when it may be said with truth, 'Japan is fully opened to the spread of Christianity.'

"But perhaps it may be asked: 'Is it not still a law that a native who professes Christianity shall be put to death?' To this an affirmative answer must he given; but it should be remembered that another law was passed at the same time which declared that any Japanese who returned to his native country after having been for any cause whatever in any foreign country should be put to death. As this latter law, though unrepealed, is not executed, so it is believed that the law against professing Christianity will in like manner not be enforced.

"In conversing with Mr. Harris, the United States Minister at Yedo, on this subject, he stated that he had used every endeavour to have this obnoxious law repealed, but without success; a principal reason being that the Government feared that it would form a pretext for the old conservative party to overthrow the Government and again get into power.

"'I do not believe,' said Mr. Harris, 'after all that the other foreign ministers and myself have said on the subject, that this law will ever be enforced; but if it should be, even in a single instance, there will come such an earnest protest from myself and the representatives of the other Western Powers that there will not likely be a repetition of it.'

"The non-repeal of this law, therefore, while it is a matter of regret, is nevertheless not to be adduced as a proof that Japan is still closed to missionary effort, but only as a reason for a prudent course of procedure on the part of the missionaries."

Whatever the laws may have been, the Government seemed to have little fear of the missionaries, for in 1861 it sent a number of young men from Yedo to Kanagawa that they might be taught English by them.

While there were few opportunities for direct religious work among the Japanese, the needs of the European population were not forgotten. Services were held in the consulates or in private houses. In 1862, there was erected in Nagasaki, "the first Protestant church ever built in Japan," where Mr. Williams conducted services, attended by foreign residents, and where he hoped that in time he might be able to hold meetings for Japanese, In 1863, there was organised among Americans in Kanagawa and Yokohama, the "First Reformed Protestant Dutch Church in Japan," one of whose members is said to have been a Japanese,\* perhaps "Sam Patch." Dr. S. R. Brown became the pastor of this church, which did not long continue in existence. The same year a church building, where services were conducted by the Chaplain of the British Legation, was erected in Yokohama. The "union services" hitherto held were suspended for a while, but soon resumed at the American Consulate.

In November, 1864, occurred the first recorded baptism on Japanese soil of a Protestant Christian. Rev. J. H. Ballagh has given the following account of this person.

"Yano Riuzan, a shaven-headed Buddhist, a *yabu-isha* or quack doctor, who held an inferior position, was selected by the Shogun's Council of State for a language teacher for Dr. S. R. Brown. On my arrival, November nth, 1861, he became my teacher. With him I undertook the translation of St. John, more to translate the Gospel into him than for the use of others In the summer of 1864 he became quite weak. I was impressed with a failure of duty and asked him if he would be willing for me to seek a blessing upon our translation. On his consenting, I made my first impromptu Japanese prayer, which seemed to impress him much and which made a remarkable impression on me One day, while explaining a picture of the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch, he suddenly said to me: 'I want to be baptised: I want to be baptised because Christ commanded it.' I warned him of the law against Christianity and the fact that, even should he escape, his son might not. The son, being consulted, said that whatever would please his father should be done On the first Sabbath in November his baptism took place in the presence of his wife, son, and daughter."\*

The next baptisms were those of Murata Wakasa and Ayabe in Nagasaki, May, 1866. The story of their conversion sounds like a romance. Wakasa was born in 1815, and on reaching manhood became a minister \(*karo\)* of the Daimyo of Saga. He was a man of unusual stature; his grandson asserts that he was seven feet in height and therefore was obliged to have a house made specially for him, since he was so much inconvenienced by the low rooms of ordinary Japanese buildings, When, in 1855, some French and English vessels anchored in the bay of Nagasaki, Wakasa was put in charge of a patrol appointed to watch the movements of the foreign ships. One day he noticed something floating upon the water and sent one of his men to pick it up. It proved to be a book printed in some unknown language. After Wakasa's return to Saga, he became so curious to know what was in the book that he sent one of his retainers to Nagasaki, professedly to study medicine, but really to inquire about the contents of the book. He thus discovered that it was a Dutch translation of the New Testament, the book on which the religion of Europeans was founded\* A while after, he learned that a Chinese translation of the book had been made, and he therefore sent a man to Shanghai to purchase a copy. With four other persons, one of whom was his younger brother, Ayabe, he then began an earnest study of the book. In the autumn of 1862, Ayabe went to Nagasaki to see if any of the foreigners there could explain some portions that had been difficult to understand. While there he met Dr. Verbeck, who gladly answered his questions. The following spring, Ayabe again appeared and warned Dr. Verbeck that the latter's life was in danger, as a company of young men had formed a conspiracy for assassinating him. In consequence of this warning, Dr. Verbeck found it advisable to withdraw with his family to China for a few months. On his return to Nagasaki he found that Ayabe had received an appointment that removed him to another part of the country; but soon after this, Wakasa sent one of his servants, named Motono, with a new set of questions. Dr. Verbeck now became, though in a roundabout way, the teacher of the little Bible-class, for Motono would frequently come from Saga, a journey occupying about two days, bringing a list of questions to which answers were desired, and after receiving Dr. Verbeck's explanations would return with them to Saga.

In May, 1866, Dr. Verbeck was informed that some high officials from the province of Hizen \(in which Saga is situated\) desired to come in two parties to meet him. He writes:

"Accordingly, on the afternoon of the fifteenth of May, my visitor presented himself with a retinue of about thirty men, consisting of a number of attendant officers who quite filled my parlour, and of a greater number of common retainers, all two-sworded, who had to content themselves with an outside view of our premises. . . . My principal visitor proved to be no less a personage than a relative of the Prince of Hizen. . . . After the usual introductory compliments, the absorbing topic of the 'Doctrine' was entered upon with a good deal of interest. I may say that I reasoned with him of 'righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come,' but I could hardly bring him and his attendant to dwell on the higher topics of faith, hope, and love; for my august visitor insisted on reasoning concerning the unprofitable subjects of the origin of evil in the world, the mysterious permission of the continuance of evil, the justice of God or the apparent want of it under various aspects, and more of the like. I was prepared for his arguments, as I have found that on heathen ground we are often obliged to rehandle the bones of contention of the church of old, but my principal endeavour was to get him to see the wickedness and danger of all evil; that it is infinitely more important to know how to be now and forever saved from it than to know all about its origin and yet be left helpless; that it is vastly more worthy of our thought to know how we are to escape hell and gain heaven than to find out the exact location of either, if such a thing were possible. Yet my efforts to lead him to higher views at the time were vain....

"The interview of the other parties was arranged to take place on the seventeenth of May. My visitors on this occasion were Wakasa, one of the ministers of state or governors of the principality of Hizen, and his younger brother Ayabe. Wakasa was a tall man, about forty-five years of age and looking older. His is one of those faces that make sunshine in a shady place, most pleasing and amiable in expression, with a very dignified bearing. His eyes beamed love and pleasure as I met him He said he had long known me in his mind, had long desired to see and converse with me, and that he was very happy that now in God's providence he was permitted to do so....

"At this time there were admitted to our parlour Wakasa, Ayabe, Wakasa's two sons, young men of twenty and twenty-two respectively, and the servant, Motono, who had acted the part of messenger between us for four years. How different was this meeting from that of two days before\! These men. like those of Berea in the Apostles' lime, had received the Word with all readiness of mind and did not come to puzzle themselves or me with unprofitable controversies, but asked several quite natural and sensible questions to gain additional light on some points\* in reference principally to Christian character and customs. They had been taught of the Spirit.

"They showed great familiarity with their Bibles, made several pertinent quotations, and when during the conversation I referred them to sacred passages, they readily identified them and always accepted them as conclusive proofs. They were prepared to believe all that Jesus said and to do all that He required. It must be remembered that these men had been studying the Scriptures and reading a great variety of religious books with great diligence for at least four years, having begun to do so with a favourable disposition of mind. Like perhaps most of the higher classes in this country, they had no faith in Buddhism, the religion of the common people, while at the same time they were graciously withheld from falling into the opposite of a total atheism. Their minds were in a state of expectant transition when, just in time, they were led to search for and find salvation through faith in Christ.

"We spent a delightful afternoon in conversing on the saving power and love of Christ, and just as I thought my friends were about to leave me, Wakasa took me by surprise by enquiring if I would object to baptising him and his brother Ayabe before they left town. I was surprised because so many Japanese had at different times talked to me of the great peril of becoming Christians in the full sense of the word. I had expected from these men to hear something as follows: 'We believe and would like to be baptised; but we cannot think of realising our wish in this one particular so long as the law of the land hangs the inevitable sword over the heads of all who dare to change their religion; for the present we must remain as we are, but when this cruel edict is repealed, we will come forward for baptism.'

"I warned my visitors not to think lightly of the act and not to entertain superstitious notions concerning its efficacy; I urged the solemn importance of the sacrament and the great obligations which devolve on those to whom it is administered; I repeated the questions which, according to our form, they would have to answer with a hearty affirmative; and finally told them to decide, as if in the presence of God who searches the heart. They listened attentively and repeated their desire to be baptised, requesting only that it should be done and kept in secret.

"The following Lord's Day, the Day of Pentecost \[May 20\], was chosen, the hour selected being seven o'clock, p.m. Wakasa, whose position did not permit him to move about the streets without a half-dozen followers, and who could not visit me without making himself conspicuous, I did not see again until the appointed hour on Sunday night; but Ayabe came to me twice during the intervening days, and I gave him such instructions for himself and his brother as I thought might be useful to them.

"At last, when the Sabbath evening came, the two candidates presented themselves, attended into the room by none but Mo-tono. The retinue, consisting of eight followers, was dismissed at our door with orders to return in an hour. I bad arranged everything beforehand to avoid unnecessary detention. The shutters were closed, the lamps lit, a white cloth spread on the centre-table, a large cut-glass fruit-dish, for want of anything better, prepared to serve as a font Besides Motono, my wife was the only witness present, so that there were but five persons in the room. I began by reading Matthew twenty-eight, then dwelt on the concluding verses, spoke of the purpose of missionary societies, and referred to the bearing of the words of Jesus upon our present meeting. I exhorted them not to be discouraged in their peculiarly difficult situation, but rather, by a life of faith, of love, and of holiness, to disarm all the criticism of their neighbours and even persecution itself. We then united in prayer both in English and Japanese, proceeded with our liturgy, translating *ex tempore* the form for baptism; and after the administration of the sacrament, concluded with prayer and thanksgiving."\*

On reaching home, Wakasa and Ayabe reported to their Daimyo what they had done. He left them unmolested. In some way Wakasa's conversion became known to the Central Government, and the Daimyo was ordered to punish him. Nothing was done, however, except to burn some of Wakasa's books.

Soon after this Dr. Verbeck removed to Tokyo, and thus had no more direct dealings with Wakasa. The latter soon retired from active life to his country villa, where he spent much of his time in translating the Bible from Chinese into Japanese. He died in 1874, with a firm faith in his Saviour.

Though it is in anticipation of our narrative, it may be well here to give some further intelligence of Wakasa's family. In 1880, Rev. Mr. Booth of Nagasaki noticed in his audience on Sunday morning two strangers, one of whom was evidently a woman of high rank. They gave close attention to his address, and their eyes often filled with tears. At the close of the service they introduced themselves, one being Wakasa's daughter and the other her former nurse. They had learned from Wakasa the Lord's Prayer and some other portions of Scripture that he had written out for them in simple characters. The daughter had married and was living in Nagasaki; but she was acquainted with no Christians there. She was about to remove with her husband to Osaka, and desired to receive baptism before going there. Therefore, she had sent to Saga for her old nurse, and they had attempted to find some Christian teacher. They at first fell in with a Roman Catholic priest, who gave them a prayer-book; but on examination, its teaching did not seem to them like that which they had before received. They were afraid to make enquiries, fearing that they would be insulted as suspected followers of Christianity. After wandering about the city for some days, they saw a shop where the characters on the covers of the books seemed familiar. On opening one volume, they found the Sermon on the Mount, and recognised its words. They purchased several books and had a long talk with the bookseller, who, as it was Saturday, told them where they could find a Christian service the next day.

As both asked for baptism, Mr. Booth asked their reason for desiring it. "'Whosever believeth and is baptised shall be saved,'" they quoted. When he said: "How can I know that you are true believers?" the younger woman replied: "It has been my custom for years to go into my husband's storehouse every day for private meditation and prayer to God and the Father of Jesus Christ." "How do you know that this salvation is for yon?" "It is written: 'Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.'" After some days had been spent in instructing the women, the rite was administered. The younger woman's husband was present, paying close attention to the service and afterwards expressing a desire to know more about Christianity.

The nurse soon returned to Saga, where she resumed her work of teaching a small school for girls. She also organised a Bible-class for women, and its members soon became the teachers of a Sunday school. Though she is no longer living, the influence of her work still remains in Saga. Among the believers there was a son of Wakasa. The daughter, who removed to Osaka and later to Tokyo, became prominent in religious and philanthropic work. Her husband also became a Christian.

At the close of a meeting held in Tokyo about 1883, a man stepped forward and said to Dr. Verbeck: "I am Ayabe. Since my baptism I have been in the army and also employed in surveying. During all these years I have always carried the Bible with me, and I have been accustomed to read it daily." The next day he came with his only daughter, about fifteen years old, asking that she be baptised. At one time he was a local preacher in the Methodist Church.

In the early part of the same year that saw Wakasa's baptism, Bishop Williams administered the same rite to a man named Shiomura. who belonged in the province of Higo. Dr. Verbeck had three other earnest requests for baptism, but did not think it best to consent In 1868, he baptised a young Buddhist priest named Shimizu. The next year this man was cast into prison because of his faith, and he suffered in various prisons for the next five years. In 1868, also, Mr. Ballagh baptised Awazu Komei; and in 1869, Mr. Thompson baptised Ogawa Yoshiyasu, Suzuki Kojiro, and an old woman, Mr. Ogawa afterwards became one of the most prominent ministers of the Church of Christ in japan \(Presbyterian\). In 1871, Mr. Ensor, at the Church Missionary Society's station in Nagasaki, baptised a man named Nimura. Thus the whole number of recorded baptisms before the spring of 1872 was ten, evenly divided between the eastern and western parts of the country.

In 1866, there was sent forth from Yokohama the following address:
> > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > "Yokohama, Japan, 14th Jan., 1860.
"Brethren in Christ:

"A tittle company of believers of several nationalities residing here have for the last seven days been observing the concert for prayer with you of other lands, and whilst assembled this evening to supplicate the throne of grace in behalf of this heathen nation it was unanimously resolved to appoint a committee to issue an address to God's people throughout the world, asking their prayers in a special manner for Japan.

"In order that the ground of this request may be better understood, permit us succinctly to state the circumstances in which we find ourselves here at the present time. There are now Protestant missionaries representing three or four branches of the Church of Christ in this country. Two of these are at Nagasaki and the remainder at this port. Most of these have been here since 1859, or more than six years. They see marked changes in many things since their arrival.

"At first, the prejudice and suspicion of the rulers of \(his country led them, for some time, frequently to send *posses* of officers to the houses of the missionaries, ostensibly as friends calling upon friends, but really as spies, to find out for what object these non-trading people had come to Japan. But for more than three years past, such domiciliary visits have entirely ceased. The first decisive symptom of the abatement of suspicions on the part of the Government was the sending of about a dozen young men of rank from Yedo to Kanagawa to be taught English by one of the missionaries. More recently the Governors of Nagasaki and this place authorised schools to be opened for a similar purpose under their auspices, and the Protestant missionaries were invited to take charge of them. One missionary at Nagasaki has, during the last year, devoted three or four hours a day to the school there. The school at Yokohama has over fifty members, and for more than two years past, three and sometimes four of the missionaries have been engaged in it, teaching an hour or two each day. A large supply of American school-books has been imported by the Governor for this school, and the teachers have in no wise been restricted as to the manner or matter of their teaching. Through the use of these foreign school-books more or less of Christian truth is almost daily brought into contact with the minds of the pupils, and has been freely made the subject of explanation and remark in classes. The effect of this is manifest in the unhesitating manner in which the pupils make enquiries and seek information on religious subjects, and in the frequent expression given to Christian facts and doctrines in their school exercise. Four years ago, when copies of a book entitled the 'Christian Reader' were bought of a missionary by some young men who were desirous to learn English, they at once erased the word 'Christian' from the title-page and cover, for fear that it would be noticed by others and bring them into trouble. Now a considerable number of those who have been under instruction have purchased copies of the Scriptures for their own use. In the schoolrooms and in our houses there is no reluctance to speak, and many do speak from day to day, of God, of Christ, and Christianity. The name of Jesus is no longer uttered with bated breath. Some of the wives of missionaries also have interesting classes of Japanese boys under their instruction in English, with great success.

"A medical missionary has a dispensary thronged with patients from day to day, where the Ten Commandments and passages of Scripture in Japanese are hung upon the walls and read by the patients.

"Again, the *Gorojiu* or Council of State at Yedo is now making arrangements to erect extensive buildings in that city for a school in which some hundred young men of the higher classes are to be taught in an English and a French department, and the Protestant missionaries have been requested to take charge of the former. These facts will enable you to see to what extent the Japanese have come to repose confidence in the missionaries. Meantime the members of the several missions have applied themselves to the study of Japanese, endeavouring to make their labours in this direction available to those who may come after them, by publishing works for this purpose, and a Japanese-English Dictionary containing some 40,000 words is now nearly ready for the press. Most, if not all of them, have for a good while past been at work upon the translation of the Bible, so that, by a few mouths of co-operative labour, they would be ready to publish at least the four Gospels in Japanese.

"Contrary to the general expectations, it has been found that the Japanese generally do not entertain a feeling of hostility to foreigners, nor are they bigoted in religions matters. They even pride themselves upon being less stiff and more liberal in the latter respect than the Chinese. Those who belong to the class called *samurai*, who alone are eligible to civil or military office manifest much eagerness to gain a knowledge of Western languages, sciences, and arts. Some of those who have been or are now studying English are in the habit of going daily to the missionaries houses, in groups of from two to three to six or seven to read the English Bible, preferring this to the study of school-books. These intelligent young men frequently express their earnest desire that the day may soon come when all their countrymen shall have the Holy Scriptures and the free political institutions of which they are the basis. They despise the Buddhist creed and the Buddhist priest.

"One of the first teachers employed by the missionaries in 1860 recently died in the assurance that he was about to be with Jesus. He had, at his own request, been baptised in his own house and in the presence of his own family, with their full consent. Thus the first fruit of the Gospel in Japan, at least in our tune, has been gathered into the garner of God.

Here, then, we are, in the presence of this great heathen population, estimated by themselves to number 32,000,000 and you may ask: 'What hinders the Gospel from being freely and publicly preached? This is the question that presses us at this moment urges us to ask your prayers for this people.

This Government is in some respects a strong one. In consequence of what occurred with the Jesuits and monks of former times it took the most stringent measures to efface the very name of Christian \(Kiristan\) as that of a crafty usurper from the memory of its subjects, or else to make it the symbol of whatever is dangerous and detestable. Unfortunately the Jesuits did not leave the Bible in Japan when they were banished from the country, else the condition of things here now might have borne more resemblance to that in Madagascar. But now. every man, woman, and child must be registered at some Buddhist or Shinto temple, or be denied a decent burial. Thus every Japanese is in the grasp of an iron hand, the hand of the Government There is no evidence that the old edicts against Christians have been revoked; no proclamation from the Government as yet assures the people that they would not be treated as criminals worthy of the death-penalty, should they be suspected of favouring the Christian religion. The missionary might or might not suffer from the offence of preaching, but his hearers would. Here then we hesitate, and desire to know the divine will and our duty. We would neither be cowardly nor rash. We call upon our brethren in Christ to pray that this last obstacle may be removed,—that the Treaty Powers represented in Japan may be inclined to do what Christian governments ought to do in this behalf,—that the spirit of God may move the rulers of Japan to proclaim liberty to their subjects, liberty to hear and read the word of God,—and thus that speedily these everlasting doors may be lifted up and the King of Glory may come in. May we not hope that those whom this address reaches will remember this object in their families, and closets, and meetings for prayer, and that it will be specially inserted among the subjects forming the programme for the Week of Prayer in the opening of the year 1867?"

One result of this address was that great interest was aroused among supporters of the Church Missionary Society of England. One person, who withheld his name, sent to the Society a contribution of four thousand pounds to form the nucleus of a special fund for Japan, and three years after the address was issued, the Society sent out its first representative, Rev. George Ensor, who arrived at Nagasaki in January, 1869.

In connection with the study of English there was more willingness to read the Bible. In 1867, Mr. Ballagh spoke of furnishing twenty-four Bibles to one of his pupils, who intended to use them for a school in Yedo, where he taught the retainers of a certain daimyo. "This pupil told me on his last visit," wrote Mr. Ballagh, "that he intended to explain the Scriptures regularly every Sabbath to his prince's servants." In the same letter he says that Mr. Goble had just gone to Nagasaki "and entered the employ of a prince, who stipulates that he shall teach Christianity."\* Mr. Goble himself wrote:

"I am as busy as I can be, teaching school, editing a native paper, and doing a little at translating. I am engaged by the Prince of Tosa to lay the foundation of an English college; and in prosecution of this plan we expect to go up into the country of Tosa to live. We are getting a font of Japanese type cast, and expect soon to be able to print Bibles, tracts, books, and papers, with press and movable types. The English, Dutch, and Chinese versions of the Bible are already introduced as a reading-book in our school. Some of the pupils have of their own accord asked to be admitted to family worship, and others ask particular instruction in the Christian religion. One of the latter is a high officer of state to the Prince."†

On the other hand, it was a naval officer of Tosa who, in that same year \(1867\), published a memorial in which he expressed his grief that the religion of Jesus was being promulgated to an alarming extent in the open ports. He declared that the foreign priests were employing gold and gifts to seduce the people and make them instruments for deluding other victims. "If we examine the fundamental principles of the religion of Jesus," he said, "we are struck by discovering that it is entirely based upon deceit, immorality, and imposition." He complained that the Buddhist priests were not exerting themselves against the danger, nearly all having "become pleasure-seekers, idle and useless beings addicted to chess-playing, reading poetry, tea-drinking, making bouquets, and given to the vices of wine and women." He said that as Buddhism had long been the main support of the Mikado's Government, "Every one who opposes Buddha and assists the religion of Jesus is the enemy of Buddha,—that is, the enemy of his country. Let him not dwell under the canopy of heaven; let him be exterminated. Help must come soon, for the fall of Buddha is very near. The fall of the Buddhist religion is the fall of the Mikado."\*

January, 1868, saw the great revolution by which political power was restored to the Emperor, and a new form of government inaugurated. In May, the American Minister received a set of official gazettes, whose publication had been commenced in Kyoto. They were numbered from one to nine, with the exception that the sixth number was lacking.† As this excited curiosity, a copy of the missing number was obtained and was found to contain the following law, which was to be posted with certain others in all the towns and villages, replacing similar laws of the Shogunate.

"The evil sect called Christian is strictly prohibited. Suspicious persons should be reported to the proper officers, and rewards will be given."

The foreign representatives at once remonstrated against this edict, saying that, while they had no desire to interfere with the internal affairs of Japan, they could not remain indifferent to an act that cast such odium upon the religion of the nations from which they came, the publication of such an ordinance at such a time being inconsistent with the friendly feelings professed by the new Government.

The Japanese ministers replied by referring to the strong feeling that the people had against Christianity because of the troubles to which it had given rise in former years. It was generally supposed, they said, that its followers practise various magical rites connected with foxes and other objects of superstitious dread. While it was impossible to prevent men from believing whatever seemed to them true, it was necessary to prevent the open profession of Christianity and the performance of its rites. If the Government failed to prohibit Christianity, it would be accused of favouring it. They acknowledged that the insertion of the word "evil" was ill-advised, and issued new orders saying:

"In sending out the edict concerning Christianity there was unfortunately a mistake in the wording. This arose from the fact that in past times there had been the strict prohibition of Christianity and also of evil sects. The ordinance must at once be corrected so as to read:

"'The former prohibition of the Christian sect must be strictly observed.

"'Evil sects are strictly prohibited.'"

As a Japanese writer has said, "This was a very strange order. What was the mistake? Was it in calling Christianity an evil sect? If Christianity is not evil, why should it be prohibited?"\* The reason for the amendment not being clear, the edict in many places was left in its first form.

Although, as related in another volume, persecution of Roman Catholic Christians in Kyushu began about this time, there were various signs that led the missionaries in Yokohama to believe that the Government would not make serious opposition to their work. Rev. D. Thompson began to preach publicly to the patients that came to Dr. Hepburn's dispensary. There were usually from twenty to fifty persons present, the greater number of whom listened attentively. In 1869, a Japanese who had founded in Tokyo a school with about a hundred pupils read to them the Chinese Bible and Martin's "Evidences of Christianity," though he himself was not a baptised Christian. He expressed a desire to have some missionary come and explain these books more perfectly than he himself could do.\* During 1869, the demand for Bibles and other Christian books was very great. Many persons sought interviews with the missionaries; and the abbots of the principal temples desired to obtain copies of all books telling about Christianity. The next year, there were six or seven priests receiving instruction from Mr. Thompson, while Messrs, Cornes and Carrothers were teaching others.

Dr. Verbeck in his "Historical Sketch"† considered that the first school to deserve the name of a distinctly missionary institute was one begun in Tokyo about 1869, by Mr. and Mrs. Carrothers of the Presbyterian Mission. Among the pupils were a few girls, and as these increased in number, it was thought best to form them into a separate school. One student who was about to be left with the young men came to Mrs. Carrothers to say that she was a girl and had been wearing boy's clothing on account of the popular prejudice against boys and girls studying together.‡

Among the men who had been prominent in favouring intercourse with foreigners was Yokoi Heishiro, a trusted counsellor of the Daimyo of Echizen. Soon after Perry's visit to Japan, he had become a great admirer of America, and in 1866 had sent two of his nephews to the United States for education. From missionaries in Shanghai he had obtained a copy of the Bible in Chinese, and had been much impressed by its contents. He wrote to a friend: "In a few years Christianity will come to Japan and capture the hearts of the best young men." He urged that men should be left free to follow whatever religion seemed to them true. At the time of the Restoration he became a counsellor of the Emperor. In February, 1869, when returning from the Palace, he was assassinated. The reason given for this act was that he was suspected of harbouring "evil opinions," meaning Christianity.\*

In April, 1869, representatives of the different clans met in a deliberative assembly. They had no legislative power, but discussed various subjects. Among others was that of the attitude to be assumed toward Christianity. At the request of some of the more liberal members, Dr. Verbeck prepared a paper in favour of religious toleration. On the other hand, a proposition that all foreigners entering the country should be required to trample upon the cross, found many and influential supporters.

The year 1869, saw the establishment of two new missions in Japan. The Church Missionary Society, as already mentioned, sent Rev. George Ensor and wife to Nagasaki; while Rev. D. C. Greene and wife, of the American Board, went to Tokyo \(as Yedo had been re-named\), whence they removed the following year to Kobe. In 1869, also, the first unmarried lady missionary came to Japan; this being Miss Mary Kidder \(afterwards Mrs. E. R. Miller\) of the Reformed Church. She, with Dr. and Mrs. S. R. Brown, went to Niigata, where Dr. Brown bad been invited by the Japanese Government to take charge of a boys' school. Though the engagement was for three years, at the end of eight months Dr. Brown was recalled, the local government professing inability to pay his salary. Since another teacher was at once employed at nearly the same sum, the real reason for the change was probably because Dr. Brown on Sundays taught the Bible to those that cared to study it. Miss Kidder also returned to Yokohama, where she opened a girls' school under the patronage of the Governor of that city. Some of the pupils were transferred from a class for boys and girls that Mrs. Hepburn had taught since 1867. The school may be considered the foundation of the "Isaac Ferris Seminary."

Mr. Ensor had been but a month in Nagasaki when, as he wrote:

"Day by day, hour after hour, my house would be thronged with Japanese visitors, all curious to know something about England and her science and art and progress, but, most of all, about her religion. They knew that she was a power among the nations, and believed that religion and power in a state are inseparable. More serious enquirers would wait till the darkness of night, and then steal into my house; and we used to have the doors closed and the windows barred, and as I bade them farewell when they left I scarce ever expected to see them again, for I was informed that an officer had been specially appointed to keep watch at my gate."

Some nine months later, Mr. Ensor saw hundreds of Roman Catholics being driven by his house on their way to exile. He says that one night when in an almost despairing frame of mind because of the opposition that was being shown towards Christianity:

"I was sitting by myself in my study and heard in the darkness a knock at the door. I went myself to answer it, and standing between the palm-trees of my gate, I saw the dark figure of an armed Japanese. He paused a moment, and I beckoned him to enter: and he came in and sat down, and I asked him what his business was. He replied: 'A few days ago I had a copy of the Bible in my hands, and I wish to be a Christian.' I said: 'Are you a stranger in these parts? Don't you know that thousands of your people are being detained as prisoners for this?' 'Yes,' he said, 'I know. Last night I came to your gate and as I stood there thinking of the terrible step I was about to take, fear overpowered me and I returned. But there stood by me in the night one who came to me in my dreams and said I was to go to the house of the missionary, and nothing would happen to me, and I have come,' And drawing his long sword, he held it up to me in a form signifying the Japanese oath, and promised that he would ever keep true to me, and I received him."

This man was afterwards baptised by the name of Titus; "for God," says Mr. Ensor, "who comforteth those who are cast down, comforted me by the coming of Titus."

Though the persecutions inaugurated by the Imperial Government were directed chiefly against the Roman Catholics, persons who were becoming interested in the teaching of the Protestant missionaries were not free from danger. In Nagasaki a young man named Futagawa Ito\* had feigned an interest in Christianity with the design of assassinating Mr. Ensor, from whom he requested instruction. The story of Christ's love made so deep an impression upon him that he soon came to believe what he had once hated. He became Mr. Ensor's assistant, and in 1870 was helping in the printing of a tract, when he suddenly disappeared. He had been arrested on a nominal charge of having transgressed a regulation concerning the wearing of swords; but in reality because of his connection with Christianity, as was evident from the fact that he was offered his liberty if he would renounce that religion. After a while he was sent to his native province. About his neck was fastened an iron collar to which were attached five chains. These were used to secure him in his celt, and on the road each chain was held by a soldier. On his arrival at his native village his relatives were in great distress at thought of the horrible crime he had committed. His mother for several days refused to eat any food. His sister, who had been married to a priest, was divorced. The villagers came to gaze at him through the openings of the cage in which he was confined, and to talk about the way in which he ought to be punished. After some time spent in the prison of the prefectural capital, he was taken to Tokyo. Throughout the journey he was confined in a small *hago,* which was something like a box carried by poles that rested on the shoulders of coolies. There was not room in it for him to lie down, and the top was so low that he could not sit upright. Food was given to him through a small opening in the side of the box. Only once was he allowed to get out from his narrow cell. This was at Osaka, where he was permitted to take a bath; but all the time his chains were held by five men, who also had drawn swords to cut him down if any attempt was made to escape. Mr. Ensor, who on account of ill health had been obliged to return to England before anything had been learned about Futagawa, tells us that after a while,

"Like Joseph, he found favour in the sight of the keeper of the gaol, and by-and-by, though still a prisoner himself, he was set over the other prisoners and made the keeper of the dungeon. He began to speak to those around him of the Saviour for whose sake he was bound and incarcerated. The magistrates as well as the prisoners listened to him, and treated him with great kindness; so, like St. Paul at Rome, he preached Christ from his prison, and there were between seven and eight hundred men who heard from him the Gospel, and out of these not fewer than seventy or eighty began themselves to study the Word of God."

The American Minister finally secured the prisoner's release. The officials at first made some objection to the removal of the iron collar; but the eminent scholar, Fukuzawa Yukichi, always fertile in expedients, brought a physician, who ordered its removal for the sake of health.

In 1870, or early in 1871, officials broke up Bible classes in Tokyo. On the night of June 30, 1871, Ishikawa Einosuke, Rev. O. H. Gulick's teacher, was arrested in Kobe. In his house were found manuscript copies of Dr. Hepburn's translation of Mark's Gospel, and these were seized as proofs of his guilt. His wife, though not accused of being a Christian, was also arrested because she had not informed the authorities about her husband's evil-doing. The United States Consul demanded the release of Mr. Ishikawa on the ground of an agreement between the Governor and himself that notice should be given to the Consul before any servant of a United States citizen should be arrested. The Governor, however, replied that, since the teacher did not live on Mr. Gulick's premises, the agreement did not cover his case. It was afterwards learned that the arrest had been made by orders of the secret police of the Imperial Government. When the missionaries endeavoured to find out what could be done for the prisoner, the Governor of Kobe assured them that if he had received baptism he would certainly be put to death; otherwise, his life would be spared, Mr. and Mrs. Ishikawa were for some time imprisoned in Kyoto, where he died in November, 1872. The wife was afterwards released. She testified that her husband died with a firm faith in Jesus Christ. A gentleman, who appeared to be an official, called upon Rev, D. C. Greene soon after the above arrest, and in the midst of the conversation remarked as though incidentally: "If your teacher, sitting here, should attend a Christian service, he would be liable to arrest." Mr, Greene's servants no longer dared to attend as formerly the morning prayers that he had conducted with them.

In the early part of 1871, Mr. W. E. Griffis \(who afterwards wrote many well-known books upon Japan\) went to Fukui as a teacher of English; and in the latter part of the same year Mr, E. W. Clark went in the same capacity to Shizuoka. Both of these gentlemen found opportunities for doing Christian work while in these interior cities. The contract that Mr. Clark was asked to sign did, indeed, contain a clause forbidding him to say anything about Christianity. "It was a great dilemma," he says, "for I had spent all my money in coming to Japan and getting ready to go into the interior." Some of his friends urged him to accept the condition, and the Japanese interpreter advised him to sign the agreement and then disregard it. He felt that a principle was at stake and stood firm, saying that unless the clause was struck out he must refuse to go. "It is impossible," he added, "for a Christian to dwell three years in the midst of a pagan people and yet keep silence on the subject nearest his heart." His firmness triumphed, and the clause was struck out. He began a Bible class the very first Sunday he was in Shizuoka, and kept it up all the time he was there.

The first representatives of the Woman's Union Missionary Society reached Yokohama in 1871, and there opened a school for girls.

Near the close of 1871, while the persecutions were still being directed against the Roman Catholics, a remarkable pamphlet was published by Mr. Nakamura Masanao. one of the best known teachers of Chinese in the country. It was written as though by a foreigner who, having spent some time in Japan, ventured to send a memorial to the Emperor. The writer begins by praising the liberal spirit shown by His Majesty's Government in adopting various things that have come from foreign lands, but expresses regret that it still adhered to its severe laws against Christianity. His Majesty did not seem to be aware that the secret of the wealth and power of Western nations was in their religion.

"The industry, patience, and perseverance displayed in their arts, inventions, and machinery, all have their origin in the faith, hope, and charity of their religion. In general we may say that the condition of Western countries is but the outward leaf and blossom of their religion, and religion is the root and foundation on which their prosperity depends. Now Your Majesty's subjects, pleased with the branches and foliage, wish to make them all their own; and try to imitate them. This is more ridiculous than the mimicry of apes, and it seems to me that it is a delusion to reject the very cause of the prosperity of these nations. When the heart and will are wrong, the words and conduct are also wrong; and when the root of a tree is bad, the branches and leaves are also bad. Does Your Majesty judge the Western religion to be evil? Then the Western nations must themselves be evil. And if those nations are corrupt, then their charitable and brave men are bad men, and the wonderful arts and inventions of those countries must be bad. So, too, all industry, patience, and vigour must likewise be evil. In that case the new laws which Your Majesty has introduced must be bad. The teachers employed in the schools for foreign learning are also bad men. The merchants from foreign lands who are permitted to trade in Japan are bad merchants. The telegraphs, steam-vessels, and steam-engines, and all such conveniences are bad things. Why does not Your Majesty command them all to be destroyed, the bad teachers to be expelled from the country, the bad merchants to be put to death, and the bad laws to be repealed?"

The writer goes on to say that Japan will be despised by Western nations so long as it exhibits such unreasonable hatred of Christianity; and declares that Japan cannot make due progress without accepting that religion. He says:

"So long as Your Majesty does not repeal the prohibitory laws against Christianity, however assiduously the nation may endeavour to acquire the arts and civil reforms of Europe, it can" never attain to the true European civilisation; and Japan may be likened to a manikin with face and eyes, and hands and feet, but without a soul. Can the manikin vie with a living man in the civilities of social intercourse? If Your Majesty should at last desire to establish Christianity in Japan, he should first of all be baptised himself, and become the chief of the church, and be called the leader of the millions of his people. Should Your Majesty come to such a decision, how great will be the respect and love accorded to him by the sovereigns of Europe from that time forward\! How the people of the Western countries will pray for his happiness\!. . . The praises of Japan will ascend to the heaven, and the voice of her admiration will reach to the uttermost parts of the earth."\*

During the closing week of 1871, the missionaries in Yokohama united with several English-speaking residents in a series of prayer-meetings. These were continued through the Week of Prayer in January of the next year. Dr. Verbeck in writing of them says:

"Some Japanese students connected with the private classes taught by the missionaries were present through curiosity or through a desire to please their teachers, and some perhaps from a true interest in Christianity. It was concluded to read the Acts in course day after day; and that the Japanese present might take part intelligently in the service, the Scripture of the day was translated extemporaneously into their language. The meetings grew in interest and were continued from week to week until the end of February. After a week or two the Japanese, for the first time in the history of the nation, were on their knees in a Christian prayer-meeting, entreating God with great emotion, with the tears streaming down their faces, that He would give His Spirit to Japan as to the early church and to the people around the Apostles. These prayers were characterised by intense earnestness. Captains of men-of-war, English and American, who witnessed the scene, wrote to us: 'The prayers of these Japanese take the heart out of us.' A missionary wrote that the intensity of feeling was such that he feared often that he would faint away in the meetings. Half a dozen perhaps of the Japanese thus publicly engaged in prayer; but the number present was much larger. This is the record of the first Japanese prayer-meeting.

"As a direct fruit of these prayer-meetings, the first Japanese Christian church was organised at Yokohama on March 10th, 1872. It consisted of nine young men who were baptised on that day and two middle-aged men who had been previously baptised: viz., Ogawa, by the Rev. David Thompson of the American Presbyterian Mission at Yokohama, and Nimura, by the Rev. Geo. Ensor of the Church Mission at Nagasaki. Some of these nine young men had previously received special instruction from the Rev. J. H. Ballagh of the Reformed Church at Yokohama. Mr. Ballagh, too, assisted by Mr. Ogawa and other brethren, was chiefly instrumental, under the divine blessing, in bringing about the organisation of this church. Mr, Ogawa was chosen an elder and Mr. Nimura a deacon of the young church. The members gave their church the catholic name of 'The Church of Christ in Japan,' and drew up their own church constitution, a simple evangelical creed, together with some rules of church government, according to which the government was to be in the hands of the pastor and elders, with the consent of the members."

The substance of the first of these rules was: "Our church is not partial to any sect, believing only in the name of Christ in whom all are one, and believing that all who take the Bible as their guide, diligently studying it, are Christ's servants and our brothers. For this reason all believers on earth belong to Christ's family of brotherly love." Mr. Ballagh acted as the first pastor of this church. Several of the young men who were baptised had been students of English under Dr. S. R. Brown. They had separately asked for baptism, not being aware that the others were ready for such a decisive step. Each supposed that he would meet with opposition from his associates, and at a preliminary meeting was surprised to find the others present. On returning to their room they were so filled with joy that they spent two hours in singing over and over, the hymn, Jesus Loves Me," almost the only one that they then knew.

In connection with an industrial exhibition held at Kyoto in 1872, special passports were issued to foreigners permitting them to visit the city. Among several members of the American Board's Mission who availed themselves of this privilege was Rev. O. H. Gulick, He was able to hire a house for his residence during the exhibition, and hoped that he might make an engagement with the government for teaching, or might in some other way get permission for remaining in the city. He and some of his associates had interviews with the Governor and other officials. J. C. Berry, M.D., who had just joined the Mission, was invited by some of the physicians of Kyoto to settle there, and was promised a house free of rent. The time had not yet come, however, for missionaries to begin work in the old capital. A contract by which Mr. Gulick promised to teach English gratuitously for a certain company would have been approved by the Government had he not struck out a clause that prohibited the mention of Christianity, In the amended form it was rejected. Afterwards an officer of the Kyoto police, who had helped him to rent a house and in other ways befriended him, was arrested and imprisoned for one hundred and forty days on the charge of helping in an attempt to introduce Christianity into Kyoto.

In the autumn of 1872, the American Board missionaries opened a school in Kobe. In addition to instruction in English and the sciences, the English Bible was taught for an hour each day by Mr. Greene, who on Sundays also had an attentive Bible class of twelve pupils. A similar school, with teaching of the Bible, was opened in Osaka by the American Board Mission, and another by the American Episcopal Mission, In Nagasaki was a school of the American Reformed Mission where the Bible was the chief text-book. The school in Kobe was established at the request of some young men who paid all the expenses, and it was so prosperous that at one time it numbered one hundred pupils.

A convention of missionaries was held in Yokohama September 20-25, 1872. Most of those connected with the Presbyterian, Reformed, and American Board missions, were in attendance. Neither the American Episcopal Mission nor that of the Church Missionary Society thought it best to send delegates; but Rev. Mr. Syle, acting chaplain of the English Consulate at Yokohama, and Rev. Mr. Nelson of the American Episcopal Mission in Shanghai, sat with the convention; as did Captain \(afterwards Admiral\) Watson of the United States Navy, Dr. W. St. G. Elliott, and Mr. W. E. Griffis \(the last three being elders in Union churches that had been formed by foreigners residing in Yokohama and Tokyo\), and also the elder of the Japanese church that had recently been formed in Yokohama. Father Nicolai of the Russo-Greek Church, was invited, but did not attend. The chief business of the convention was to arrange for a translation of the Scriptures. It was decided that the work should be entrusted to a committee consisting of one member from each mission desirous of co-operating. The American Protestant Episcopal Mission, the English Church Mission, and Father Nicolai, were invited to assist in the work. Resolutions were passed upon the importance of educating a native ministry, and upon providing for the publication of Christian literature. The following resolution concerning the organisation of the Japanese churches was adopted:

"Whereas the Church of Christ is one in Him and the diversities among Protestants are but accidents which, though not affecting the vital unity of believers, do obscure the oneness of the Church in Christendom, and much more in pagan lands where the history of the divisions cannot be understood; and whereas we, as Protestant missionaries, desire to secure uniformity in our modes and methods of evangelisation, so as to avoid as far as possible the evil arising from marked differences, we therefore take this earliest opportunity afforded by the Convention to agree that we will use our influence to secure, as far as possible, identity of name and organisation in the native churches in the formation of which we may be called to assist, that name being as catholic as the Church of Christ; and the organisation being that wherein the government of each church shall be by the ministry and eldership of the same, with the concurrence of the brethren."

In November, 1872, Dr. Hepburn obtained, through Mr. De Long, the American Minister, permission to present to the Emperor a copy of the English Bible, and also one of his Japanese-English Dictionary. The receipt is said to have been acknowledged by the Emperor in an autograph letter.\* Mr. De Long was afterwards censured by the United States Secretary of State for his part in the transaction, which was held to be a violation in some way of a rule of the State Department. In a semi-public letter Mr. De Long wrote:

"A rumour has obtained that I was reproved because I did not make the presentation in a customary diplomatic manner. This is a mistake. No objection was made to the course I followed; none could be taken, as I first enquired of the Minister for Foreign Affairs if such a present would be received and would be acceptable to his Sovereign, and only after being assured that it would, did I present it, and then not directly to His Majesty but to him through his Minister, which was a proper diplomatic course of action."

Near the close of the year 1871, an embassy headed by Prince Iwakura had set forth to visit the United States and Europe. Its chief object was to secure such a revision of the treaties as would do away with extraterritoriality. In the letter of credence presented by Iwakura to the President of the United States, the Emperor declared: "We expect and intend to reform and improve" the treaties "so as to stand upon a similar footing with the most enlightened nations, and to attain the full development of public right and interest." The American Secretary of State said that before permitting citizens of the United States to come under the jurisdiction of Japan it would be necessary to consider the laws of that country, and he proceeded to ask about religious liberty and the edicts against Christianity. The Japanese Ambassador attempted to make it appear that the edicts were no longer enforced. Mr. De Long was then in Washington, and when Prince Iwakura denied in his conference with the Secretary of State that there was any religious persecution, Mr. De Long cited the facts connected with the arrest and continued imprisonment of Ishikawa Einosuke. The Ambassador, who could make no satisfactory reply, was told that it was useless to ask for the desired change in the treaty so long as the religion believed by most Americans was regarded in the present manner. On going to Europe the Embassy found that it was not without reason that the British and French Chargés d'Affaires had expressed the opinion that it would not be cordially received so long as the persecution of Christians continued. Before it reached England an influential deputation from the Evangelical Alliance had presented to the Foreign Secretary a memorial in which the persecutions of the Roman Catholic Christians were narrated, and the hope expressed that, in case the treaties were revised, a clause would be inserted guaranteeing religious liberty. The *Westminster Gazette* had opened a subscription for funds to support a movement that should urge the English Government to demand the release of the Japanese exiles. A vigorous agitation was begun in France by the publication of M. Léon Pagés's pamphlet on "The Persecution of the Japanese Christians." As the Embassy rode through the streets of Brussels, many among the spectators shouted out their demands that the Japanese Christians be released. Ito Hirobumi \(afterwards Japan's leading statesman\), who was a member of the Embassy, wrote to his Government, declaring that wherever he went he was met by the strongest appeals in behalf of the Christian exiles and for religious toleration, He was sure that, unless the Government acceded to the first request and evinced a disposition to be somewhat liberal in the other matter, it would look in vain for friendly concessions on the part of the foreign nations.

In November, 1872, Mori Arinori, who was in Washington as the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, prepared a memorial to his Government in favour of complete religious freedom. Annexed to it was a draft for "The Religious Charter of the Empire of Dai Niphon" \(Japan\). This, as given in the English version, was as follows:—

"Whereas, in matters of conscience and religious faith, it has been justly observed that the manner of exercising them can be properly determined only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and

"Whereas, no man or society of men has any right to impose his or its opinions or interpretations on any other in matters of religion, since every man must be responsible for himself, and

"Whereas, we have no other purpose than that of avoiding for our nation the misery which the experience of the world shows has followed the patronage by the state of any particular religion;

"It is now solemnly resolved and declared that the Imperial Government of Dai Niphon will make no law prohibiting, either directly or indirectly, the free exercise of conscience or religious liberty within its dominions.

"And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that the organisation of any religious orders shall not be interfered with by either local or national authority, so long as such organisation does not conflict with the law of the State.

"And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that the law of the Empire shall recognise no religious institution as special or different from any other kind of social institution.

"And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that no special privilege or favour shall be granted by either local or national authority to any particular sect or religious denomination without extending the same at once to every other.

"And it is further solemnly resolved and declared that no religious or ecclesiastical title or rank shall be conferred by the state upon any person belonging to any religious association.

"And it is further, in conclusion, solemnly resolved and declared that no action which may promote religious: animosity shall be permitted within the realm."

In this, as in many other propositions made by Mr. Mori to his Government, he was too far in advance of his times. Not until the proclamation of the new Constitution, February II, 1889, was religious liberty assured to the people of Japan; and on that very day, Mr. Mori, the advocate of such liberty, was assassinated by a Shinto fanatic for having, as was alleged, raised the curtain of the shrine at Ise with his walking-stick.

Though the guaranty of religious freedom did not come until 1889, the Government on February 19, 1873, ordered the removal of the edict-boards which, among other regulations, prohibited Christianity. At first it was supposed that this action implied open toleration. It was indeed feared by some missionaries that the Government might, for reasons of state, go too far in favouring Christianity, it being known that the Embassy while in Berlin, had consulted with a German professor of jurisprudence, concerning the expediency of adopting it as a state religion.\* To those unacquainted with the Japan of that day it may seem that such action could not have been seriously contemplated; but there were several reasons that might lead the officials to favour it. They were anxious to have Japan recognised as on an equality with Western nations, and those who were in Europe saw that the difference in religion added greatly to the difficulty of accomplishing their purpose. It would, at least, be necessary to allow Christianity to be preached to the people, many of whom would be likely to accept it; and the Government wished to retain the leadership in all new movements. Buddhism was disliked by many of those in power; and it was about this time that many native scholars and even Shinto officials were saying: "Shinto is not a religion; it is a system of government regulations, very good to keep alive patriotism among the people."\* Already the Council of the Shinto Gods, which previously ranked with the Great Council of Government, had been replaced by a Religious Department, lower in rank, whose duties were not confined to matters connected with Shinto. Thus, it will be seen that many of those in power, accustomed as they were to consider religion an instrument to be used by the Government for its own ends, had no such strong feelings in favour of other religions as would make them oppose the State's adoption of Christianity, if thereby any political advantage could be gained. It is certain that more than once in later times influential men seriously advocated that Christianity be made a state religion.

Probably individual members of the Government differed concerning the advisability of removing the laws against Christianity; and there was fear that serious opposition might be manifested by the people. Accordingly a notice was issued stating that the edicts, which included laws against murder, arson, robbery, etc., as well as that against Christianity, had been taken down "because the people are so thoroughly acquainted with them and know them by heart." Notwithstanding this explanation, the Buddhist priests in some places instigated riots among the peasants in opposition to the removal of the boards.

In recent years it has been asserted that the action of the Japanese Government in removing the edicts was wholly due to its own liberal spirit, and not to any representations sent back from Western countries by the Embassy. It may be well to compare this assertion with what was said at the time, as reported by Mr. De Long, the United States Minister, in a letter addressed to Rev. J. Goble, in November, 1873.

"Relative to the repeal of the edicts against Christianity or their supposed repeal, the truth is this:—The edicts were taken down and removed from public observance by order of this Government, but were not repealed. On the contrary, when they were removed, officers of the Government detailed for this express purpose called on all of the Japanese residents and warned them that, although the edicts had been taken down, they still remained ill force and must be obeyed as laws. When this action came to my knowledge, I taxed one of the Assistant Ministers for Foreign Affairs with bad faith. He in reply entreated me to not so consider it. at the same time saying: 'The liberal party in Japan is yet in its infancy, but I assure you it is increasing rapidly. We have been able to secure two triumphs—one the return of the exiled Christian converts, the other the removal of the edicts.' These matters, he assured me, had been attained mainly upon the strength of advices received from one of the Ambassadors, Governor Ito, who in a communication addressed to his Government, written from Europe, had advised them that wherever he went he was met by the strongest appeals in behalf of these exiles and for religious toleration; and he felt assured that, unless his Government acceded to the first request and evinced a disposition to be somewhat liberal as to the other matter, it might look in vain for friendly concessions on the part of foreign powers in treaty with Japan, He farther assured me of the disposition of his party and of himself to go much farther at once, but that it was deemed unsafe to do so as yet, as undue haste might ruin all. Placing full faith in these representations, I consented to let matters rest for a season and wait a more favourable opportunity.

"This statement proves that no particular man or government is entitled to the credit of having obtained these results. They are the fruit of the earnest labour of Foreign Representatives at this Court, Christian missionaries in this Empire, and Christian statesmen and gentlemen abroad who had access to the Embassy and improved the opportunity they enjoyed."

In the first period of missionary effort a beginning had been made towards providing a Christian literature. Reference has already been made to some of the works that were published. It will be convenient here to give a more detailed account; and since the translation of the Bible is one of the first things to take the attention of Protestant missionaries, we will consider what had been accomplished in this direction up to the close of the year 1872.\*

So far as known, the first work of this kind was that of Dr. Gutzlaff, who, with the help of the shipwrecked Japanese that found shelter in his house at Macao, made a translation of the Gospel of John. By the aid of the American Bible Society this was printed about 1838, on the press of the American Board at Singapore. When the circumstances of its production are considered, it is not strange that it was very imperfect and abounded with errors.

Dr. S, Wells Williams also attempted by the help of shipwrecked sailors to make translations. The results appear not to have been published.

Dr. Bettelheim, while in Loochoo, prepared a translation of the New Testament in the dialect he found in those islands. The Gospel of Luke was printed at Hongkong. Afterwards Dr. Bettelheim, while in Chicago, obtained the assistance of a Japanese for bringing his translation more into conformity with the language used in Japan proper. This revision of the Four Gospels and Acts was printed at Vienna in 1872, and many copies were sent to Japan.

The Protestant missionaries in Nagasaki made early attempts at translation.

Dr. Hepburn states that when he undertook this kind of work in 1861, the prejudices against Christianity, and the fear of the Government were so great that his teacher, after proceeding a little way in the Gospel of Matthew, positively declined to remain in his service. In 1866, the *Christian Intelligencer* of America, said, concerning the work of missionaries of the Reformed Board: "The Gospels are translated. The money is ready to print an edition. . . . Shall we print the Gospel? The missionaries hesitate, fearing bloodshed. For, by the laws of Japan, whoever may be converted by reading the Word of God may be put to death with all his family." Reference is probably made here to the translations prepared by Dr. S. R. Brown; and the question of their publication was settled in 1867, when his manuscripts were all destroyed by fire.

Finally, in 1871, Mr. Goble had an edition of the Gospel of Matthew printed from wooden blocks. He said of this: "I tried in Yokohama to get the blocks cut for printing, but all seemed afraid to undertake it, and I was only able to get it done in Tokyo by a man who, I think, did not know the nature of the book he was working upon." The next year, Drs. Hepburn and Brown published Mark and John. Their translation of Matthew was issued in 1873.

The first tract was published by Dr. Hepburn in 1864. Shortly before it appeared, he wrote:

"I am now publishing a Christian tract. The block-cutter is at work on it and will probably finish it in a month. It is one of Dr. McCartee's \[of China\] tracts, which my teacher with my supervision has translated into what appears to me to be very-good Japanese. It is the tract 'The True Doctrine Made Plain or Easy...' I have to be very secret in getting the blocks cut. No doubt, if the officers of the Government knew it, they would soon put a stop to it. Most providentially, as it seems, the man who is cutting the blocks is employed by one of our merchants and lives in bis compound; and that merchant, strange to say, is a Jew, but a most liberal one; indeed, \[think he is much more of a Christian than a Jew,"

Another early tract prepared by Dr. Hepburn consisted of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, and the Apostles' Creed.

One difficulty attending the preparation of tracts for the common people is described by "Rev. J. D. Davis, D.D., and may be inserted here, although what it narrates occurred in the first year of the next period of our history. Dr. Davis says:

"In the summer of 1873, the writer sat under the maples by the waterfall in Arima, the only missionary in the place, and wrote in *Romaji* \[Roman letters\] in his broken Japanese the first draft of a little tract. Two months later, when his teacher had copied this into Japanese, he asked him to revise it, and it came back in such high Chinese that none of the common people could read it. He then asked a scholar of the pure Japanese language to put it into such language that the masses could read it, and after another month it came back about fifty degrees higher yet. The writer then took his original draft and sat down-with his teacher and fought it over word by word and sentence by sentence, demanding that the words which could be understood by the greatest number of the common people should be used; and after two months more it was ready for the block-cutter; but his teacher begged of the writer not to let any one know who helped in the preparation of it, as he would be ashamed to have it known that he prepared so colloquial a book."

In other ways the printed page was the medium for teaching Christian truth. Students of English found in their reading-books frequent references to religious doctrines. English books on ethics were for a while diligently studied in the government schools. One who was a teacher in these schools has written of this time:

"Every class of students able to read a foreign language, from the highest to the lowest, was supplied with text-books on morals, and the use of them continued during several months. Suddenly an order from the Dai Jo Kwan \(the Emperor's Privy Council\) to discontinue the study arrived in the various schools, this study was banished from the curriculum, and the manuals of Wayland, Haven, and Malebranche were exiled to the dust and oblivion of the top shelf. Text-books on morals made by Christian writers were supposed to be too strongly flavoured with Christian theology, and the name so long publicly outlawed and hated in this Empire occurred too often on their pages to render it safe to allow such books in the hands of Japanese youth. A noted native educator. . . had 'translated' Wayland's 'Moral Science'... This 'translation,' however, is but a fragment. It omits all the positively Christian theology of the book, much of the theory and reasoning, and gives scarcely more than the results arrived at by the author and a portion of the moral code which is expressed in the book. Those high officers who read only the translation and were pleased with it, sanctioned the use of the various moral text-books of foreign countries, not knowing their full contents. On discovering their true nature, however, the order to discontinue the study of these books was sudden and peremptory. . . . A few weeks later came an order prohibiting all students in the government schools from attending or visiting a Christian church."\*

The first attempts at Christian hymnology were probably the translations of "There is a Happy Land," and "Jesus Loves Me." The first version of the former was made by Mr. Goble. The imperfect knowledge of the language led to the production of verses that have since been a source of merriment. The first stanza commenced,
> "Yoi kuni arimas  
Taiso empo.> Shinja wa sakaete  
Hikari zo."
Apparently several persons attempted the translation of "Jesus Loves Me." These two hymns, so far as is known, were the only ones produced before 1873.\*

\* This society seems for some reason to have afforded only a scanty support to Mr. Goble. In a memorial of his wife he says that, being detained two months in San Francisco, "the young missionaries were only saved from penury by working with their own hands to supply their daily wants. . . . They lived first in Kanagawa for two years, during which time they were in deep poverty, much in debt, mending shoes to get a little food, the husband and father watching five weeks, night and day without cessation, at the sick-bed of his apparently dying wife, whose illness was brought on by poor diet and living in a miserable little native house." They returned to America, where they received appointment from the Baptist Missionary Union and were sent to Japan in company with Dr. Nathan Brown; but these relations were soon severed and Mr. Goble became an independent missionary. He remained in Japan until after the death in May, 1882, of Mrs. Goble. Going to America, he died there in May, 1898. Mr. Goble early translated the Gospel of Matthew into colloquial Japanese. At one time he was in the employ of the American Bible Society and adopted methods by which the sales of the Scriptures were greatly increased. He was the inventor of the *jinrikisha.* His wife being in poor health, he wished to obtain some means of conveyance for her. In talking over the matter with, a Japanese carpenter, it was decided to make a wheeled vehicle. Mr. Goble found on the cover of a *Godey's Lady's Book* an advertisement of baby-carriages. With some changes, the pictures furnished the model for the first *jinrikisha,* which, though not so light and handsome as those of later days, answered its purpose. The *jinrikisha* has been claimed as a purely Japanese invention, but those first made showed plainly that they were an adaptation of a Western vehicle.

\* An interesting sequel to this account of Yokoi is given in Dr, A. D. Hail's "Japan and Its Rescue." Years after the assassination, a prayer-meeting was being held in the town of Shingu preparatory to the coming observance of the Lord's Supper. A lumberman who had come from a place forty miles distant among the mountains said, after several had confessed their sins; \* I, too, have a confession to make. Before I became a Christian I used to be intensely angry towards any one who was even suspected of being a Christian. Having heard that a prominent man in Japan had some English books in bis possession and a Chinese Bible, I felt that he must be a believer in Christianity. Many others, also, thought as I did. Twenty-four of us accordingly covenanted together to kill this man. We watched our opportunity, and having heard that he had come to Kyoto, we divided ourselves into squads of six and placed one squad in each road along one of which we knew he must leave the palace. I was not in the squad which slew him. When we heard, however, that the deed had been accomplished and that two of the attacking party had also been killed, we all separated and ran away. I never knew what became of the various members of the band of twenty-four. A neighbour of mine and I went to the place where we now live and have been there ever since. Now, according to the rules of Old Japan \(pointing to the Christian worker that accompanied Dr. Hail\), it would be that brother's duty to take my life, as he is a nephew and so a very near relative of the murdered man. It was before I knew Christ that I could contemplate such an act. I believe God has forgiven me, and I ask forgiveness of all."

He sat down weeping, and there was a time of general and deep feeling. The nephew then said: "I know that according to our old ideas I should be regarded as unfaithful and unfilial if I did not attempt at all hazards to take the life of the brother who has just spoken. But I know that what he did was done in ignorance of Christ and His Gospel. I, too, have been a great sinner; but have obtained mercy and am taught to forgive as I would be forgiven, and through Christ's grace I forgive." The next day these two sat down together, with all the brethren, at the communion table.

### JAPANESE ARGUMENTS AGAINST CHRISTIANITY 

IN 1868, there was circulated in Kyushu a pamphlet that may well be given in full, as it shows how the Japanese looked upon the missionaries and their religion. It also narrates from a different point of view some of the events described in previous chapters.\*

TALES OF NAGASAKI—THE STORY OF THE EVIL DOCTRINE

*The Roman Catholic Religion*

At a village named Oura, near Nagasaki, the French built a church, and five or six priests took up their residence there. They gave wages of a hundred or two hundred *rios* annually to about twenty Japanese readers and sent them out in the disguise of traders or travelling students to Hirado, Shimabara in Hizen, to Fukabori and to Amakusa. To the poor they gave money, and to the superstitious they exhibited prodigies in order to proselytise them, or worked upon their feelings by conventicles. \(A conventicle is a meeting of both sexes at night in a secret chamber for pleasure.\) In a short time, therefore, one or two hundred fellows sprang up who disregarded the most stringent injunctions of the lords of the districts, and neglected the social relations and the five virtues—a most fearful state of things, indeed\! A certain spy, as he was concealed under the veranda of a house in Urakami, heard a priest of the evil religion preaching who said: "Persons who enter our sect and believe its doctrines will be born in heaven and enjoy eternal felicity; while believers in Shintoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism will all go to hell and suffer torment. Should only a single person of a family enter our sect, the rest will all be born in heaven by his merit." Then he showed them in a "Glory," palaces and mansions, and people enjoying themselves with beautiful women. Consequently they became desirous of dying at once and being born in heaven, and do not care for the severest punishment, I will narrate further stories of the prodigies performed.

*The Jesus or Protestant Doctrine*

In the same way the Americans and English have built Jesus halls, and five or six priests coming, try to lead astray the talented and clever men of Japan. These priests of the Jesus doctrine live mostly in private houses, and under pretence of teaching astronomy, geography, and the use of fire-arms, and medicine desire in actual fact to spread about the abominable poison of Jesus. Compared with the Roman Catholic religion this is a very cunning doctrine indeed. Although they try to make out that there is nothing abominable in it, they are really foxes of the same hole, and it is really more injurious than the Roman Catholic doctrine. The priests say: "The Jesus doctrine which I recommend to you does not practise magic; it advocates the observance of the social relations and the five virtues" But in the matter of abolishing Shinto and Buddhism and of treating prince and father with contempt, it does not differ from the Roman Catholics, for which reason it is very hurtful to the state.

A Chinaman named Chang Chi-tsuo, in a letter to a friend of mine, says: "I find from ray acquaintance with the retainers of Japanese daimyos residing in Nagasaki that they are all studying western learning by command of their princes. The fact is the western barbarians practise murder instead of agriculture. Astronomy, geography, warlike weapons, and other toys of theirs are only fit to amuse the eye and ear. But there is not one of their books which does not praise the spirit of Jesus or of the Lord of Heaven, and persons who do not study those books with a profound appreciation of fundamental truth will find themselves respecting the doctrine before they know where they are. I sincerely hope that the doctrines of Jesus and of the Lord of Heaven may not spread all over Japan in two or three years." Those words are perfectly true. Should it turn out so, Japanese will become enemies of their own country for the sake of foreigners. I pray most earnestly that benevolent men and superior men will not be led astray by the evil plots of these people, but will assist our countrymen with just laws, and keep the state as firm as Taisan.

*Elements of the Evil Doctrine*

The Jesus doctrine and the doctrine of the Lord of Heaven are the same in origin, and merely branches of one tree. Three hundred and fifty-two years ago a division of the Roman Catholic religion was founded, which, professing to observe the true meaning of Jesus, called itself the Jesus doctrine. They say that the Roman Catholic religion consecrates wooden images and practises all sorts of prodigies. The Jesus doctrine does not even consecrate images of Jesus; it merely instructs, and does not practise prodigies. They derive their doctrines from the Old Testament in thirty-nine books, and the New Testament in twenty-seven books. The commencement of the Old Testament says that five thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight years ago the Lord of Heaven made the heavens and earth, the sun, moon, and stars, herbs, trees, birds, and beasts, in the space of five days; and on the sixth made a man and a woman who are the original ancestors of all mankind. Wherefore the Lord of Heaven is also called the Creator. He is also called the Great Prince and the Great Father; \(natural\) princes and fathers being distinguished as little princes and little fathers. In that case what is said in the Classic of Poetry, that "in the whole of what is under the heavens there is no place which is not royal territory; in the whole earth there are none who are not royal subjects" comes to nought. And when they say "that the Lord of Heaven made human bodies which were of earth, and that the Lord of Heaven put life into them," what is said in the Classic of Filial Piety, "that we have received our bodies, hair, and skin from our fathers and mothers," comes to nought.

They look upon prince, father, and mother as nurses who merely nourish us, and say that if we worship our ancestors we shall be hated by the Lord of Heaven, This is treating prince and father with contempt and entirely destroying the natural relations of prince and vassal, father and child, which is a great evil to the state.

The Old Testament contains the Ten Commandments of the Lord of Heaven. The first of those says: "There is no other Lord but me." Consequently the evil confederation of Urakamimura near Nagasaki threw the tables of Tenshoko Daijin \(the Sun-goddess\) and of Kasuga Hachiman and the rest into the water, into the fire, and into the privies. The sixth says: "Thou shalt not kill;" but this means, "Thou shalt not kill people of our religion;" but they murder the most virtuous persons and superior men if they do not belong to their religion. The seventh says: "Thou shalt commit no abominable lechery;" but there are many cases in the Old Testament of persons who are said to be beloved by the Lord of Heaven becoming united in the bonds of parent and child, brethren, husband and wife; and besides, at Urakami, near Nagasaki lately, under the name of conventicles, men and women meet secretly in the depth of the night, which is abominable lechery. The eighth says: "Thou shalt not steal;" but they seize on other countries and make them subject to their own. Is this not flagrant robbery?

In the New Testament is written the history of Jesus from his birth to his death by crucifixion. This person called Jesus was originally very poor. In his fifteenth year he was banished, upon which he travelled through many countries learning magic arts, curing the sick, and stopping floods, and other magic. He deceived the ignorant lower classes, making them follow himself until his evil design of murdering the sovereign of the country and seizing the country and people for himself being discovered, he was put to death by crucifixion. He was a most traitorous animal. It is, however, written that he was crucified to atone for the sins of all men; that after his death he came out of his grave and preached for the space of forty days to his disciples, and ascended to heaven alive. This is the invention of those fellows, and entirely unfounded.

Considering that the foundation lay in such violent wickedness, it is impossible that any of his believers can be either filial or loyal. They say that the most unfilial and disloyal can go to the very top place in heaven if they only love the Lord of Heaven, The disasters of Shimabara and Amakusa may be looked upon as warnings to avoid. The love of novelty is unfortunately such that, if divine tickets and images of Buddha are caused to fall from heaven, as they have been since last autumn, there are plenty of common people, who, under pretence of worshipping the gods, dance and sing drunken songs, and forget the principles of social relations. Such would be the misfortunes of the state, were people to he sunk in this evil doctrine.

What I pray for is that patriotic *samurai* in this country shall learn how these people offend against the principles of fidelity and filial piety; what ambitious designs they have against the state; and fortifying men's minds with good principles, block up every chink by which the evil doctrine might creep in; and perform one act of good service to the sovereign.

I do not aim here at describing the thing in detail, but only to speak a bit of my mind and narrate a story for the benefit of the ignorant and young.

*History of the Evil Doctrine in Nagasaki*

Since the opening of the port of Nagasaki, the French among the western barbarians have mainly preached the Roman Catholic religion, and the English and Americans the Protestant religion. In addition to these there are the Greek religion, the Mahometan religion, &c., all of which resemble the former and are as injurious to the state as they are.

In Oura, at Nagasaki, Roman Catholic churches and Protestant churches have been built and the Japanese are secretly induced to join these religions. The Roman Catholic religion proselytises from the middle down to the lowest classes of the inhabitants; the Protestant religion chiefly proselytises those of a higher position than She middle class.

The proselytes of the Roman Catholics are as follows. In Urakami, near Nagasaki, above two thousand people; in the territory of Omura, above one hundred persons; in the territory of Fukabori in Hizen, above fifteen hundred; Yokohama, Shimabara in Hizen, Amakusa in Higo, Hirado in Hizen; in these last four-places proselytising is going on, and it is not known exactly how many thousands are there.

On the evening of the twenty-third day of the sixth month of last year \(July, 1867\), the Governor of Nagasaki sent to Urakami, seized the evil ones, and threw them into prison. The images in the church which had been built at Urakami were seized at the same time and entrusted to the charge of the Mayor of the village. The officers who were sent to apprehend them brought them all, seventy-odd in number, to the Governor's official residence. Six or seven men were left to guard the Mayor's house; but the remainder of the evil band, to the number of several hundred, attacked the place and possessed themselves of the images, &c. They also seized two officials and two of their subordinates as hostages, declaring with violent language that they would not give them up unless the prisoners were set at liberty. In consequence, these hundreds of other offenders were left alone and not apprehended.

The people of the next village, called Nishi, were all of a resolute disposition and always observed the principles of loyalty and filial piety. Although built in a continuous line with the village of Urakami, it did not contain a single one of those evil fellows. When the evil fellows of Urakami were apprehended, the officials were very much afraid and did not like to force an entrance; but the people of Nishi, thinking that now was the time to do their duty, forced their way among the enemy and did good service.

In Urakami there is a place subject to Omura. As that place contained some of the evil band, the authorities of Omura arrested more than a hundred in the commencement of the seventh month, and committed them to prison.

The evil ones who had been apprehended by the Governor of Nagasaki and cast into prison were daily summoned by him and remonstrated with on their evil conduct, but they remained obstinate and gave no signs of repentance. On the contrary, they actually begged that they might be openly permitted to join the Roman Catholic sect.

As the Governor and Collectors could do nothing with them: on the fourteenth day of the eighth mouth, the priests of nine temples—seven being of the Shin sect and two of the Zen sect-were summoned to the Governor's official residence and asked if they could suggest a plan for bringing back the evil fellows of Urakami.

The priests replied that they would give in their answer after mature consideration, and retired. Next day they sent in their reply, which was to the effect that they would do their best in exhorting those people to change their hearts.

On the nineteenth day the Collector and judges set out to Urakami with the priests of the nine temples, and tried to exhort those people; but they were obstinate and refused to be convinced in the slightest degree, the fact being that, as they had not been severely dealt with up to that time, the evil bands only increased in their obstinacy.

In the middle of the ninth month, the people imprisoned by the Governor of Nagasaki falsely pretended to have repented and were released from prison, but they only collected together again and increased in numbers from day to day.

As the affair of those who had been released from prison ended only in their village being made responsible for them, the evil fellows thought they had found a capital opportunity; they took a quantity of money out of their church with which they went secretly to all parts, giving money to the poor, performing magic and wonders, and proselytising the people. Consequently, in a short space of time, large additions were made to their numbers—ten in one place and a hundred in another.

The fourth commandment of the evil religion ordains the observance of a day of rest. Japanese began gradually to keep this day, by which their having entered the sect became apparent.

As the Roman Catholic religion had spread so widely, it behooved those of the Protestant doctrine also to take their measures to increase the circle of their sect also. A person called Maria, wife of one Verbeck, a priest of Jesus, left her child at the breast and went to China in a steamer. She went as far as Shanghai and Hongkong for the purpose of getting the priests residing there to come with her to Japan.

This is a summary of the doings of the evil ones at Nagasaki. I do not know what may be the state of things at Yokohama and Hakodate, As there are several priests residing at those places also, it is pretty certain that they will entice Japanese gradually.

Since Hiogo became an open port last winter, no doubt the priests will gradually make their entrance there, and I fear they will pour their abominable poison in a short time into Osaka and Kyoto also. But as they have not commenced working at those places yet, I hope that a plan for protecting us against them will be matured while there is yet time.

As the evil ones of Nagasaki who are fully convinced are not at all likely to be converted again, I think they ought to be visited with the severest punishment. But the persons who have been merely drawn in by others will probably repent if they are exhorted in the proper manner.

In the above I have given a brief account of the rise and spread of the evil doctrine.

Another pamphlet that was widely circulated at about the same time was, "A New Essay on the Protection of the Country, by the Rev. Folly-Pitier." A few extracts will serve to show the objections commonly urged against Christianity.\*

"The doctrines of honouring the Lord of Heaven and believing in Jesus appear to be the foundation of the Protestant religion; but nothing is taught of cultivating one's person, regulating one's family, ordering the state, and tranquillizing the empire. The fifth of the Ten Commandments of the Lord of Heaven is 'Honour thy father and mother.' Some tracts have lately been published entitled, 'Elements of the Five Virtues in the Holy Scriptures,' and 'Elements of the Five Social Relations in the Holy Scriptures,' which are made up of texts picked out of different parts of the two Testaments and twisted so as to bear out the meaning of the title; but they do not contain the correct principles of the human relations. They are merely got up to stave off troublesome opponents and also, at the same time, to take people in; but they do not represent the real spirit of the Protestant religion....

"It is quite true that one of the Ten Commandments directs that honour be given to parents, but as no care is taken to give effect to this injunction by teaching it to the people, we do not find that either Abraham, Moses, or Jesus, who are venerated as holy and sage men by the Protestant religion, were celebrated for their filial piety."

"Seeing that the great principle of filial piety, which is the root of all good actions, is thus neglected, we cannot expect to find any traces of loyalty either. There is not one of these so-called wise and holy men who has acted with loyalty towards his lord and master. Besides, there is not a single word about loyalty in the whole of these numerous books and thousands of words of which the two Testaments are composed....

"The Ten Commandments consist of two laws: 'Honour and love the Lord of Heaven,' and 'Love thy neighbour as thyself.' Respect to parents comes under that universal love which is meant by 'Love thy neighbour as thyself.' Therefore, although the expression, 'Honour thy father and thy mother,' exists, it does not urge the practice of filial piety. Jesus said: ' He who loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me.' In discussing this question in the 'Dialogue on the Christian Religion,' Jesus is made first and of greater importance, and parents last and of less importance. When the great principles of loyalty and filial piety are thus neglected and the five virtues thus destroyed, how can one expect perfection in the social relations? In the 'Mirror of the Way to Heaven,' the five social relations are said to be insufficient, and another relation, that of heaven and man, is set up as the chief of all the others, as being of the highest importance. The object is to destroy the five relations and to substitute that of heaven and man for them all. The Lord of Heaven is the Lord of all countries and the Father of all men; He is therefore the Great Prince and Great Father. All difference between high and low among men is done away with, and this is because the single relation of heaven and man is made to take the place of the five relations. Under these circumstances, little love and honour are shown towards prince and father, and when they are despised it is impossible that there should be any loyalty or filial piety. It is no wonder that there should be no loyal or filial men among the Protestant fellows. In discussing the question of filial piety, which they rarely do, they say that the child's duty is fulfilled by his supporting his parents as long as they are alive and burying them when they die. The father of one of Jesus's disciples having died, he asked permission to go home and bury him. Jesus would not permit it...."

"It objects strongly to the worship of graven images. The second Commandment says: 'Thou shaft not worship graven images.' There are two books called 'Reasons for not Worshipping Graven Images,' and 'Argument against the Worship of Graven Images,' which attack the practice with great violence, besides passages in many other books which condemn it. Should the Protestant religion spread in Japan, I fear the consequences will be the complete destruction of the shrines of Ise and Hachiman, \[of places\] where the bodies of the Emperor's ancestors repose, of all the sacred images of the gods, and of the tablets of our forefathers. Protestant churches will be built, and only the Lord of Heaven and Jesus will be worshipped. Laws which have remained in force from the earliest ages will be abolished, and the imperial line, which has lasted for the last ten thousand generations, will be polluted...."

"If we allow our countrymen to become corrupted by this abominable religion, it is to be feared lest the disposition which venerates the Imperial line should disappear and traitors arise who would aim at the throne for themselves. This is what I have feared and grieved over for years, I humbly pray the princes, nobles, and great officers to speak to the wise of the three systems \[Shintoist, Buddhist, Confucianist\] to rigidly prohibit this religion while our people are not yet deeply affected with Protestantism; to expel these fellows, to prevent the divine Princes from being polluted by the stinking wind, to prevent this necromantic doctrine from throwing the right system into confusion; and thus insure to the people safety under the shadow of the Imperial favour."

An appendix to the pamphlet speaks of the way in which the division between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism arose, and closes by saying: "The evil nature of Protestantism being thus apparent, the reader may judge of the equally evil nature of Roman Catholicism without my enlarging on the subject."

### PLOUGHING AND SEED-SOWING   1873-1882





THE year 1873, was a turning-point in the history of Christianity in Japan. The attitude of the Government suddenly changed. We have already seen that, on February 19th, orders were issued for the removal of the edicts against Christianity. There were other signs of increased freedom. A few newspapers had been established, and in one of these that was published in Kobe there appeared, in April, an article written by a young man who was then a student in America, and who at a later date became one of the most efficient pastors in Japan, Paul Sawayama. The most remarkable thing about this article, which, after criticising Shintoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism, urged the introduction of Christianity, is that such sentiments could be published and freely circulated in Kobe less than two years after Mr. Ishikawa had been arrested for having Christian books in his possession, and but five months after his death in prison.

Moreover, in this year public preaching was begun in Kobe by Rev. D. C. Greene, of the American Board Mission, On the principal street was secured a building, whose front part was used for a Bible and tract depository, while the remainder was fitted up as a chapel. At first, the service was little more than a Bible-class; but very soon the audience increased until the building was filled to its utmost capacity. Sometimes as many as two hundred people were in attendance. About the same time, Messrs. Gulick and Gordon, of the same mission, began to hold a public service in Osaka. It was attended by an average of fifteen persons, most of whom were students in the day-school that was taught by the same missionaries. What was probably the first Sunday-school *conducted, in the Japanese language* was begun at Kobe in December, J. C. Berry, M.D., of the American Board Mission, being its superintendent.

In the spring of 1873, the Governor of Kobe obtained from the Central Government permission for Dr. Berry, who had begun medical work the year before, to teach anatomy by dissection in the provincial hospital. Beginning with ten students, Dr. Berry soon had a large class under his instruction. He also opened dispensaries in some neighbouring towns. The following story shows how entrance was gained to one of these places. Rev. and Mrs. J. D. Davis, with an infant child, spent the summer of 1872 in Arima, a few miles from Kobe, and one day they visited the neighbouring town of Sanda. Large numbers of people were attracted to the hotel to see these strange visitors. Mr. Davis writes:

"Among the rest came the wife of the ex-Daimyo of that little province, whose home was there. She brought with her three little children, dressed in foreign clothes. Soon afterwards the Daimyo and his family came to Arima and visited us every day; and there began an intimacy which has ripened into the warmest friendship. Soon after our return to Kobe last year \[1872\], this family came here \[Kobe\] to live, and we took into our family a girl who had lived with them for five years. Last spring one of the little children died, and the sorrowing friends wanted it buried in foreign style; so we worked out a casket, which was made of the best camphor-wood, and then loving hands trimmed it, laid the beautiful sleeping form within it, and crowned all with a wreath of the brightest flowers, and when, in reply to the eager enquiries of those sorrowing hearts, Mrs. Davis told them of Jesus and of heaven, and that she trusted their darling was forever safe there, a new world was opened to them, tears of joy mingled with those of sorrow, and an interest was awakened which we hope will end in heavenly bliss. . . . A month ago, Dr. and Mrs. Berry spent five days in the Daimyo's old home, Sanda. They found a great eagerness on the part of the people to read and hear the Bible, over fifty coming on one occasion."

Afterwards the physicians of Sanda obtained a building for a hospital, which was visited every month by Dr. Berry, and was also used for preaching. Several of the persons that became prominent members of the Kobe Church were formerly retainers of the above-mentioned Daimyo.

Notes furnished by Dr. Davis tell us more about Sanda, He says:

"About the first of September, 1873, we rented two rooms in Sanda and stayed there two weeks at the request of the young men, some twenty of whom came there three times a day to study the Gospel of John. I could speak the language only in a stammering way, but I did the best I could to make the meaning clear to them. After returning to Kobe, I bought a Japanese pony and rode over to Sanda, twenty miles, each Saturday, spending the Sabbath and coming back on Monday. The company of young men continued interested and for a few weeks I bad no trouble. But arriving there in a pouring rain one Saturday night in the early winter, the hotel where I usually stopped refused to let me stay and I met a refusal from every hotel in the place. It was evident that an opposition to the 'Jesus way' had been developed. It began to look as if I should have to return whence I had come. I was leading my horse in the darkness on a back street, praying for guidance. I knocked at an unknown gate. A boy came and I made known my request to stay all night. Soon the response came that I could stay. It was a small Buddhist temple of the Shin sect. The father was dead, and the widow and her young son were poor and glad of the trifle I could pay for rent; and there we had our meetings for about six months. I had the main room of the temple; eating, sleeping, and preaching before the images and sacred relics of the temple."

The second Japanese church was organised in Tokyo, September 20, 1873, by the American Presbyterian Mission. It had the same doctrinal and ecclesiastical basis as the one organised the year before by the Reformed missionaries, and from the latter church came seven of the eight members, Ogawa Yoshiyasu, who afterwards became a prominent minister, was the first elder.

For more than three years the Reformed missionaries at Nagasaki had taught in the government schools; but in the autumn of 1872, believing that the way was open for more direct work, they opened a private school at their own house. Afterwards a girls' school under the care of Mrs. Stout was added. As the limits of private rooms were soon outgrown, it was arranged that both schools should be removed into the native city. It was a distinct understanding that, while the schools should be under native patronage, the teachers should have entire control of all instruction, leaving the way thus clear to make the schools entirely Christian, when the time should come to do so. It was felt that this could not be done so long as the edicts against Christianity were in force. In the course of a few weeks about fifty girls and thirty boys were in regular attendance. Only the common English studies were taught in the city, but a Bible-class at the mission residence was regularly attended by a large number of the older boys in the evening. Soon the edicts were removed, and it was believed that the time had come for making the school openly Christian. The Bible was introduced into the boys' department. An attempt at intimidation was made by those that had been most active in establishing the school. The pupils, however, seemed to mind this but little, and the Bible-class was continued. Then the patrons summarily closed the school. The pupils were begging for instruction, and so the school was re-opened at the residence of the missionaries.

"Shortly after this, in connection with Mr. Bonnell, the teacher in the government school, a Sunday school was established, consisting of young men both from the government and private schools. For the work thus carried on, private rooms were found too strait; but by the kindness of Captain Janes, a Christian gentleman teaching in Kumamoto, a commodious schoolhouse was built in 1873 and the schools carried on there. This building was well filled with an interested school, especially on Sundays. There also the first baptisms took place in 1873, the first native prayer-meeting was held, and the Gospel first publicly preached, in this part of the Empire."\*

Mr. Burnside of the Church Missionary Society, who also desired to open in Nagasaki a school for boys, met with the same difficulty that had troubled the missionaries of the Reformed Board. About the close of the year, as he writes:

"I called upon the Governor of Nagasaki to ask his permission for my opening such a school in the native town itself, giving him at the same time clearly to understand that besides teaching English I should also teach the Bible, and also that I should, once a week at least, on Sunday afternoon, hold a service in the same house. His reply was that so far as the school was concerned he did not apprehend much difficulty hut that neither the reading of the Bible nor the Sunday service could be at present permitted. I might do what I liked, he said, in the foreign settlement, over which he had no jurisdiction, but that if I applied for permission to open such a school in the native town, I should be required to promise that I would not in the slightest degree influence those who might attend the same on the subject of religion."\*

Mr. Burnside baptised two persons in the year 1873. What he afterwards learned concerning one of them shows another difficulty that beset the work. Of this person Mr, Burnside wrote:

"He sought baptism, I have since discovered, feigning repentance of sin and faith in Jesus, solely and wholly in order that he might obtain money from the Kyobusho, or Department of Religion, by betraying those whom from time to time he might meet at our house. . . . For nine mouths prior to his baptism he had, on several occasions, asked most earnestly to be baptised, and I had on each such occasion told him that I thought he had better wait until such time as he should be further instructed in the faith. At length his profession of faith in the Lord Jesus, his confession of sin, and his contrition of heart appeared so sincere and his grasp of the truth so intelligent that I felt it would not be right of me any longer to delay, and therefore I decided to baptise him....From that day to this he has not been near me."

With the commencement of 1873, the old way of reckoning time by lunar months was changed so as to bring the months and days into correspondence with those of the Gregorian calendar; but instead of numbering the years from the birth of Christ, they were reckoned from the date assigned for the accession to the throne \(660 B. C.\) of the mythical Jimmu Tenno, the alleged founder of the Imperial Dynasty, or by the old system of year-periods.

Foreigners employed by the Government had hitherto been allowed to have Sunday as a day of rest; but in the summer of 1873 notice was given that there would be a return to the Japanese system, by which the first, sixth, eleventh, sixteenth, twenty-first, and twenty-sixth of each month were holidays. This action was taken in the absence from Japan of Mr. Soeshima, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had been sent to China as an ambassador. According to a letter written by Dr. Maclay of the American Methodist Mission:

"The official who was appointed to act as Minister during his absence belonged to the old obstructive party, and he formed a conspiracy with other leading men of the same party to overthrow the grand programme of reform to which the Government had committed itself. He issued an order prohibiting the students in the government colleges and all the pupils in the schools being present at any time at any Christian preaching or teaching. He also ordered that Christian missionaries who were employed as teachers in the University at Yedo and elsewhere should be no longer engaged; and effectually to prevent them and any truly Christian laymen from becoming educators, he decreed that the seventh-day rest, which Soeshima bad agreed to, should give place to a fifth-day rest. He and the other malcontents thought there would be radical differences of opinion upon this action of his among the members of the foreign diplomatic corps; but, with a degree of unanimity which is extremely gratifying, the ministers of the Western powers entered such a protest and made such representations on the subject to the Japanese Government that the reactionists were compelled to suspend their attack."

After Mr. Soeshima's return, Mr. De Long, the United States Minister, objected to what had been done, saying that it was an act of special and invidious legislation against one class of reputable citizens of the United States. He went on to say:

"The effect of the edict will be disastrous to your own Government. You will lose the services of the most thoroughly qualified and efficient teachers who are now serving in your schools; and by your efforts to ignore the Christian Sabbath you will make it impossible for any educated and honourable gentleman from Europe or the United States to enter the service of your Government,"

When Mr. Soeshima said that the order had been issued in his absence and that he would inquire into the matter, Mr. De Long added:

"The subject is of such importance that after retiring from this interview I purpose at once to wait upon the Minister of Education, and in his presence, enter my formal protest on behalf of the Government of the United States."

"You need not do so," responded Mr. Soeshima with energy, "I will attend to the matter." He did as he had said, and it was not long before Christian teachers were restored to their places.

It was in 1873 that Nakamura Masanao. one of the most distinguished scholars in the land, received Christian baptism. Though in after years he did not prove so zealous as had been hoped, his action at this time in braving the opposition of his associates did much to call attention to Christianity.

Another noted scholar, Yasui Chuhei, published under the title "Bemmo," an attack upon Christians that obtained a wide circulation. Its popularity was increased by its having an introduction written by Shimazu Saburo, one of the most influential men in the country, who had been a leader in the movement for overthrowing the Shogunate.\*

The writer of this work begins by representing himself as an old man who, having considerable leisure, thought that he would spend part of it in examining the Bible. The results of this investigation led him to say:

"The errors of the Foreign Book are monstrous and without reason; the arguments contained in it are shallow, and do not properly need any refutation on my part. But foolish people, being deceived by this Foreign Book, believe in it and retain this belief until they die, which is a source of trouble and disturbance, and this evil would seem to be gradually extending itself until it threatens to reach us, so that to withhold explanation longer would be wrong."

The author then criticises the stories contained in the Pentateuch, asserting that many of them are incredible and represent Jehovah as a malignant and unjust deity. He considers that Noah's flood was coincident with one mentioned in Chinese history. Passing on to the New Testament, he objects to the teaching of Christ as contrary to the principles of loyalty and filial obedience that form the basis of Confucian ethics. Objection is made to Christ's claim that love to Him should exceed love to parents, to His telling a disciple no. to go to bury his father, and to other verses that "have the effect of making sons show a want of affection for their fathers, and daughters for their mothers, and create estrangement between a wife and her husband's mother." The teaching of Jesus is alleged to be arrogant and boastful.

"It does not bow to the authority of the sovereign of any country. It is not for me to explain these things for the benefit of sovereigns in general; but what I fear \(in the event of this religion being adopted\)\) is lest the customs of the country should be abolished and disturbance created. Jehovah called Himself the jealous God, and did not permit His followers to worship any other. Jesus strengthened this law more and more and swore that He would destroy other gods. It was therefore that He said: 'I am not come to bring peace into the world but to create strife.' Should then this religion be adopted the shrines of Jimmu Tenno, and of the various Emperors and nobles, and those dedicated to patriotic and illustrious men will have to be destroyed, and the whole nation, down to the ordinary *samurai* and lower classes, will have to give up offering masses for the souls of their parents and ancestors."

The year 1873 was further noteworthy as one that saw a great increase in the Protestant missionary force, which was more than doubled, the twenty-nine new workers being one more in number than those that were in the field at the close of the preceding year. The number of missions was also increased by the coming of the American Methodist Episcopalians, the Canadian Methodists, and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The work of the Baptist Free Mission having been transferred to the American Baptist Missionary Union, Mr. and Mrs. Goble, who had been in America on a furlough, returned to Japan in company with Rev. Nathan Brown, D.D., and Mrs. Brown. In March the Baptist Church in Yokohama, composed at first of these missionaries, was organised, and in July the first convert was baptised. In December the Presbyterian missionaries of Yokohama organised a presbytery, and at about this time a Union Chapel was erected for the use of foreign residents in Tokyo.

The following extract from a letter written by Rev. O. H, Gulick after a visit to Yokohama gives some facts concerning the condition of the work at the close of the year:\*

"The native church of Yokohama under the care of Mr. Ballagh has now enrolled about fifty members, while that of Yedo \[Tokyo\] under the care of Mr. Thompson numbers nine with a prospect of an early addition of as many more. The two native elders of these two churches not long since made a preaching tour through the cities and villages on the northeastern shore of the Bay of Yedo. They were listened to with interest and were unmolested; but some of those who afforded them shelter and countenance have been since called to account and annoyed by the officials. . . . There are in all twelve missionary societies, including those of the Roman Catholic and Greek churches, labouring in Japan, The Roman Catholics report fifteen missionaries here, and the Greek Church has one in Yedo and is represented also in Hakodate. The following table presents a list of the evangelical missionaries labouring in Japan.

Those reported in the table as located in Aomori Ken were Rev. and Mrs. Wolff of the Reformed Mission, who were employed as teachers of English in the city of Hirosaki. On Sundays they had Bible-classes. Another teacher in the school where they taught was a young Japanese who had been a pupil of Mr. Ballagh. Though not yet baptised, he had told the people about Christianity and aroused their interest in it before the coming of Mr. and Mrs. Wolff.

In 1874 the Edinburgh Medical Mission sent out the only representatives it has ever had in Japan, Dr. and Mrs. Theobald A. Palm, who remained in Tokyo until the next year, when they removed to Niigata. The United Presbyterian Church of Scotland also sent out several missionaries. Among them was Henry Faulds, M.D., who at once opened a dispensary at Tokyo, and soon gathered about him a number of medical students.

At the request of Bishop Williams of the American Episcopal Mission, his former diocese was in 1874 divided by the appointment of a bishop for China, thus relieving him from the necessity of long journeys to that country, and permitting him to give his whole attention to Japan. Six persons "the first fruits of the Mission," had been baptised at Osaka, November 16, 1873, and fourteen more the next April. All of these were confirmed before July, 1874.

In Tokyo, one of the American Baptist missionaries, at the request of some Buddhist priests who expressed a desire to hear about Christianity, took up his abode in quarters offered him at one of their temples in Shiba. Failing health, however, soon necessitated the withdrawal of this missionary from the field. Mr. Mori Arinori, whose memorial in favour of religious liberty has been mentioned, rented to the Baptists a house in Surugadai, Tokyo, where they established a girls' school, which has since developed into the Sarah A. Curtis Home.

The church in Yokohama connected with the Reformed Mission continued to prosper. In the course of 1874 fifty-seven adults were added by baptism, the whole number of members rising to one hundred and nineteen. Some twelve of this number joined a theological class that was taught by Dr. S. R. Brown. Its members combined practice with theory by engaging in evangelistic efforts.

The American Board missionaries in Kobe and Osaka were greatly encouraged by the growth of their work, and by the earnestness shown by the converts. In the winter of 1873-74 the first prayer-meeting in the Japanese language that had been held in Kobe met at the house of Mr. Greene. Seven or eight men and one woman were there heard to pray for the first time. In Osaka, a few days later, Mr. Davis, going from Kobe, preached in a building that stood beside the gate of Dr. Gordon's house. At the close of the sermon, a physician arose unasked and broke out in a touching prayer. After this he and five other Japanese went into a darkened room, where Dr. Gordon was obliged to Stay on account of trouble with his eyes, and there each of them offered prayer.

Of five young men in Kobe who expressed a desire to follow Christ, Mr. Greene wrote in January, 1874:

"I have been particularly pleased to see how readily they fall in with the theory of self-support and self-propagation. One of the aims of these young men is to make the church a missionary society, and I believe that it will be such from the start. . . . God has seen fit to make the influence of missionary work in Japan felt first and most strongly by the intelligent classes. The large majority of those who have become Christians hitherto are of this class, both here and in Yokohama and Yedo. . . . Whatever may be right elsewhere, there ought to be no question about having the Japanese support their own pastors and build their own churches from almost the first, if not from the very first."

The medical work of Dr. Berry, in the same field, gave promise of being self-supporting. In February, when writing of visits made to places near Kobe, he said:

"The plan of requiring that the medicines dispensed to the sick poor be paid for by the wealthy is working admirably. Besides paying for all the medicines prescribed during each trip \(amounting the last time to about $50\), they have raised $2,500 for three charitable hospitals, which we hope to have under full headway within six weeks. It is easy to see what the influence of such a course will be upon the question of self-support among the churches, which, from present indications, will soon concern us."

A word may be added about the method by which Dr. Berry and some other medical missionaries won the good will of the Japanese physicians. They made it a rule not to see patients except as consulting physicians in company with Japanese doctors who took charge of the case. Thus the latter were not deprived of their practice by the foreigner, they received their fees as before, and in addition they obtained valuable instruction. A further advantage was that the patient, being under closer supervision than the missionary could give, was more likely to carry out directions concerning medicine and diet. Japanese doctors were very desirous to learn the Western system of medical practice. The physicians of a city would unite in opening a dispensary to which they invited the medical missionary; and these dispensaries often proved gateways by which the Gospel entered the towns where they were established. The medical work did much to break down prejudice against foreigners, which was still very strong. Dr. Wallace Taylor of the American Board Mission has written:

"I well remember our first going into Himeji; how we were scrupulously shut up in our *jinrikishas* from view for miles before we reached the place, hurriedly run into a large *samurai yashiki* \[quarters formerly occupied by the military classes\], and the huge gate immediately shut and barred behind us. We were prisoners and carefully watched, not that we might not get out, but that no one should get in to harm us. Here we were kept and not allowed out, but patients were brought to us. After a few visits, when our patients had made known what we were and the character of our work, we were allowed out on the street, but only within certain limits and always accompanied by a guard whose vigilance we could not evade."

April 19, 1874, a church of eleven members was organised in Kobe. Several Christians from Osaka, twenty miles distant, walked to Kobe in order to be present at services similar to those that a month later \(May 24\) were to take place in their own city, when seven of them were formed into a church.

From the first the Kobe Church showed great activity,\* sustaining a daily service in the hospital and sending its members to other cities for evangelistic efforts. In June the church numbered nine men and five women; and of the men, eight desired to be trained for preaching the Gospel. More than half of the members of the little church in Osaka expressed the same desire. One missionary wrote:

"This whole region around us seems to have received the impression that to become a member of the church means to become a preacher of the Word. A short time since, when the question of forming a church was proposed to a little company of Chrisitians in Sanda, twenty miles north of Kobe, one objection came to all their minds at once, that they did not know enough to *preach* yet."

The churches in Kobe and Osaka, like those previously organised in Yokohama and Tokyo, possessed no denominational name. The missionaries of the American Board, at their annual meeting in May, took the following action:

"Resolved: That we as a Mission declare that we are unequivocally in favour of union; that we have never for a moment wavered from our unanimous desire for union as expressed at the Convention in Yokohama in September, 1872, and that we are organising and shall continue to organise our churches on the basis adopted at that Convention."

It after a time, however, became plain that there were differences of opinion concerning the scope of the resolutions of 1872; the missionaries of the American Board supposing it would be sufficient if all the churches were one in name, belief, designation of officers, and general method of procedure; while some among the missionaries in Tokyo and Yokohama insisted that there should be more complete uniformity and organic union in a Presbyterial system. In the autumn the Presbyterian Mission organised churches in Yokohama and Tokyo "on a strictly Presbyterian basis," thus deviating from the simpler form adopted by earlier organisations. The one in Tokyo was in a large measure the result of work done in the schools that were under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Carrothers. It was described as "a very active body. Connected with it were a Sunday school, a Bible-class, the beginning of a theological class, a debating society, several preaching-places in the city, and outstations at Shinagawa and Hoden. Shortly after its formation the Mission built for this church a cheap but comfortable chapel."

In Nagasaki it was found necessary to discontinue the girls' school that had been carried on for nearly two years by the Reformed Mission, appeals to the Board for teachers having proved fruitless. The time had come, however, for more active evangelistic work in that city, and the Mission erected a chapel which, though blown down when near completion, was speedily rebuilt, so that it was used for services in December.

At the other extremity of the Empire, Rev. M. C. Harris and wife, of the Methodist Episcopal Mission, had reached Hakodate in January, 1874, being the first Protestant missionaries to settle in Yezo. They were followed in the summer by Rev. and Mrs. Walter Den-ing of the Church Missionary Society. As Mr. Dening was accompanied by a Christian from Nagasaki, he was able to begin services at once. Large numbers of people listened to the preaching, and the first baptism took place on Christmas Day. In December Rev. and Mrs. John Ing, missionaries of the Methodist Episcopal Church, were passing through japan on their way home from China, and he accepted an invitation to become a teacher in Hirosaki, a city in the northern part of Hondo. Probably this was to take the position held the year before by Mr. Wolff.

In December, 1874, Messrs. Okuno and Ogawa, elders respectively of churches in Yokohama and Tokyo, conducted the funeral of a Christian. For this they were called to account by the officials. They were closely interrogated on several occasions, and it was not until September of the next year that they were finally dismissed after being reprimanded for what they had done. For several years the burial of Christian believers gave rise to troublesome questions. Most graveyards were connected with Buddhist temples, and the laws would not permit burials elsewhere. Thus it was in the power of the priests to give Christians much annoyance. A few years later, one of the missionaries in writing about the burial of a believer, said:

"A grave had been already purchased in the grounds of a Buddhist temple, but the priest refused permission to bury, closing the gates and offering to return the money. A Shinto priest was then appealed to, but it was not until after a night and a day had been spent in running hither and thither, and a promise not to specially mark the grave, that a grave was obtained. The service was performed in the house, and the priest simply acted as registrar,"

Frequently it was necessary to allow the priests to say masses in connection with the burial of Christians. After the funeral service had been held in the house of the deceased, or in the church, the Christian friends would leave the body at the entrance of the temple until the priest had completed his ceremonies, when the friends would again take up the coffin and bear it to the grave. Often, however, the priests would be satisfied to receive burial fees, after which they kindly forgot the necessity of chanting their prayers. On the other hand, there were priests that made the most of their opportunity to oppress the Christians. In one place they refused to permit a woman to be buried unless her husband would promise to renounce Christianity. After holding out three days, he rendered a nominal submission, though resolving in his heart that he would not give up his faith. We cannot judge him harshly when we remember that, being the only Christian in that part of the country, he had no one to advise him, and that he was liable to arrest if he allowed the body to remain longer unburied. When Dr. Joseph Neesima died in 1890, the Buddhist priests would not allow his body to be buried beside that of his father, because they regarded him as "the very head of Christianity in Japan."

A statement made in May, 1875, said that there were then not less than ten places in Yokohama, twenty-five in Tokyo, ten in the Kobe-Osaka district, and five in other places, making fifty in all, where regular Christian services were held as often as once a week, with audiences varying from twenty to two hundred in number. The people were rapidly losing all fear of governmental interference in religious matters, while their interest in the truths of Christianity seemed to be increasing. The previous year, several chapels had been secured in Tokyo and Yokohama without any opposition from the Government, and a Protestant church building was in process of erection in Tokyo, the property being held by four trustees. The object of the building was distinctly avowed to be that of Christian worship, and a declaration to that effect had been presented to an officer of the City Government.\* In July, 1875, the Church Missionary Society erected a church in Nagasaki. Its turret was surmounted by a cross, which was the more noteworthy because the city had been the place where the ceremony of trampling on the sacred symbol had formerly been most observed. Before this, indeed, the towers of the Roman Catholic Church were adorned with crosses; but at the time of its erection, in 1864, that building had been looked upon by the officials as intended for the use of foreigners.

Another church built at this time was in Yokohama. Known as the Union Church, and also as the Kaigan Church, it served for more than thirty years as a place of worship for the foreign community and also for the oldest Japanese church. Of the $8,000 expended in its construction, $1,000 came from the Christians of the Sandwich Islands, who, on hearing of Commodore Perry's expedition, had contributed money to be used, whenever possible, for a church building in Japan; $1,000 had been contributed by Hon. Townsend Harris, in 1861, under like conditions; $500 by Hon. R. H, Pruyn, Mr. Harris's successor; and $50 by British seamen.

The same year saw the erection of two buildings for the use of girls' schools. Mention has already been made of the day-school taught by Miss Kidder, in Yokohama. Feeling that much more could be accomplished if the pupils were brought more constantly under helpful influences, she leased an acre of land from the local government and applied to her home church for funds to be used in the erection of a boarding department. The Sunday-school children of America responded to this call, so that in June, 1875, a building with accommodations for forty pupils was formally opened. At first the pupils numbered fourteen, all of whom had before attended the day-school. The boarders paid three dollars a month for rooms, fuel, light, food, washing, and tuition; they furnishing their own clothing, bedding, books, and stationery. Common-school branches were taught in English, and there was also instruction in Japanese and Chinese. Daily religious services were held.\*

In Kobe Miss Talcott and Miss Dudley of the American Board Mission had taught classes of girls since 1873; but to them also it seemed that the time had come for a boarding school. They were encouraged to go forward by the interest that was shown by Japanese friends, who contributed eight hundred *yen* for the building, a *yen* at that time being worth nearly as much as an American gold dollar. Other money came from America. In order to make the sum at the disposal of the mission go as far as possible, the building was made very plain, the contract with the carpenter stipulating that there was "not to be a moulding on it or about it," It was planned to accommodate thirty girls with their teachers. "It was much too large for the faith of some good friends of the school, but in less than two years another building was imperatively demanded." Towards the second building Japanese gave six hundred *yen,* while foreigners living in Kobe gave two hundred *yen.* For later buildings the Japanese have also contributed liberally.

These and other schools have often had to contend against opposition, jealousy, and suspicion. A few years after the opening of Ferris Seminary, as the school in Yokohama was called, the father of one of the pupils from the interior came and asked if he might see the buildings.

"His conduct seemed somewhat peculiar, for he wanted to be shown every nook and corner. Finally he addressed the matron in the most confidential manner, saying that he had been told by a Buddhist priest that foreigners at the school where his daughter was had been sent out from their country to obtain a very precious drug, which could only be obtained from the bodies of Japanese girls; that it was very costly; and that was why they could put up such fine schools and take pupils at such low rates. 'Tell me truly,' said he, 'for you too are a Japanese; you must know of this, if it is true. Do these foreigners attach a machine to the bodies of the pupils while they sleep?'"\*

In 1875 there was begun in Kyoto, though only in a hired building, a school for young men. Previously the missionaries of the American Board had sought to gain an entrance into the old capital of the Empire and a Christian whose home was in Kyoto had joined with another from Kobe in asking the Central Government if a missionary could reside in the former city. It was necessary that the document should have the stamp of the ward officer before it could be forwarded, but this official wrote to the chief petitioner that he did not dare to set his seal to such a request. Soon after this, in November, 1874, there returned to Japan a native of the country, who was to be the means of opening Kyoto to the Gospel and of establishing there Christian schools whose graduates would take an important part in the evangelisation of the land.

Joseph Hardy Neesima,† to use that form of writing his name that is best known to readers of English, was born in Yedo, January 14, 1843, his father being a retainer of the Daimyo of Annaka. He was about sixteen years old when, as told in an account of his life that he wrote in imperfect English after he had been about six months in America:

"My comrade lent me an atlas of United States of North America, which was written with China letter by some American minister. I read it many times and I was wondered so much as my brain would melted out from my head, picking out President, Building, Free School, Poor House, House of Correction, and machine-working, etc. And I thought that a governor of our country must be as President of the United States, And I murmured myself that, O Governor of Japan\! why you keep down us as a dog or a pig? We are people of Japan. If you govern us you must love us as your children. From that time I wished to learn American knowledge, but alas, I could not get any teacher to learn it. . . I visited my friend and I found out small Holy Bible in his library that was written by some American minister with China language, and had shown only the most remarkable events of it. I lend it from him and read it at night, because I was afraid the savage country's law, which if I read the Bible, government will cross \[crucify\] whole my family. I understood God at first, and He separated the earth from firmament and light upon the earth, made grass, trees, creatures, fowls, fishes. And he created a man in His own image, and made up a woman, cutting a man's side bone. After He made up all things of universe. He took a rest. That day we must call Sunday or Sabbath day. I understood that Jesus Christ was Son of Holy Ghost, and He was crossed for the sins of all the world; therefore we must call Him our Saviour. Then I put down the book and look around me, saying that; Who made me? My parents? No, God. Who made my table? A carpenter? No, God. God let trees grow upon the earth, and although God let a carpenter made up my table, it indeed came from some tree. Then I must be thankful to God. I must believe Him, and I must be upright against Him. From that time my mind was fulfilled to read English Bible, and purposed to go to Hakodate to get English or American teacher of it. Therefore I asked of my prince and parents to go thither. But they had not allowed to me for it, and were alarmed at it. But my stableness would not destroy by their expostulations, and I kept such thoughts praying only to God; please I let me reach my aim."\*

Finally, in 1864, without having obtained the desired permission, he made his way to Hakodate, where he was for a while Père Nicolai's teacher of Japanese. His desire to go to America was very strong; but, if caught in an attempt to leave the country, the penalty would be death. At last he managed to escape and went to Shanghai, where the captain of a ship bound for Boston consented to let him work his passage thither. Before leaving Shanghai, he sold one of the two swords that as a *samurai* he was accustomed to wear, and with the proceeds he bought an English Bible. Often during the passage, when harshly treated by the sailors, he was tempted to use the other sword upon his persecutors; but thoughts of his great purpose to obtain an education in America restrained his hand and gave him patience.

In Boston, the owner of the ship, Hon. Alpheus Hardy, a Christian merchant, who was deeply interested in missions, took the young man for a servant, and soon seeing his great worth, sent him successively to Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., to Amherst College, and to Andover Theological Seminary. Before he had completed his theological studies, the Japanese embassy, headed by Prince Iwakura, came to America and wished him to become an interpreter to assist them in their investigation of the educational institutions of America and Europe. By the advice of his friends he accepted the position, which not only gave him exceptionally good opportunities for seeing the schools of different countries, but also won for him the friendship and esteem of those whose official positions enabled them in after years to help him carry out his plan for establishing a Christian school in Japan. When his duties with the embassy were at an end, he refused the flattering offer made to him if he would return with it to Japan, and went back to his theological studies at Andover. After graduation he was ordained in Boston to the Christian ministry. He was appointed a corresponding member of the Japan Mission of the American Board, his support continuing to come from Mr. Hardy, who was Chairman of the Board's Prudential Committee. Just before he was to leave America, the annual meeting of the Board was held at Rutland, Vermont, \(October, 1874\), and he had been asked to say a few words. At the last moment he put aside the speech that he had carefully prepared, and with broken voice and overflowing eyes made an earnest plea that a Christian school of high grade should be established in his country. He closed by saying: "I cannot go back to Japan without the money to found a Christian college, and I am going to stand here until I get it." The audience was greatly moved by this appeal, and nearly five thousand dollars were subscribed on the spot.

On reaching Japan, he at once went to see his aged parents in Annaka. As the people of that town were eager to hear about his adventures, he took the opportunity to speak openly concerning Christianity, This was perhaps the beginning of direct Christian preaching in the interior, and the officials were puzzled to know what ought to be done about it. The Governor went in person to consult the authorities in Tokyo, who said to him: "If it is Neesima, it is all right; let him alone." Thus early did the advantages from Mr. Neesima's connection with the embassy begin to appear.

Mr, Neesima soon proceeded to Kobe and Osaka in order to consult with the members of the American Board Mission. They were earnestly in favour of establishing a Christian college. The need for it was emphasised by the fact that among the foreign teachers employed in the Imperial University and other schools were men of immoral lives, while some others took pleasure in ridiculing Christianity and the Bible. The first thought was to establish the school in Osaka. The Governor of that city, however, was a bitter opponent of Christianity, who had been concerned in the recent persecution of the Roman Catholics. He expressed his willingness to have a school, but only on condition that no missionary should teach in it.

Attention was now turned to Kyoto. In 1872 members of the Mission had become acquainted with Mr, Yamamoto, a blind man who was a private counsellor to the Kyoto Government. The acquaintance had been continued, and in the spring of 1875 Dr. Gordon presented him with a copy of Dr. Martin's "Evidences of Christianity," printed in Chinese. A short time after this, when Mr. Neesima met Mr. Yamamoto, the latter said that the book had cleared away his doubts concerning Christianity, "Christianity alone," he said, "can reach and renovate the very spring of the human heart. The day has dawned upon me, so that I can see the path that before was utterly unknown to me, for which I have been unconsciously seeking." Through his influence the provincial governor was led to approve the plans for the school, Mr. Yamamoto also promised to let it have for a very small sum a large lot of land that until lately had been occupied by the mansion of the Daimyo of Satsuma, It is interesting to note that it was here that Shimazu Saburo had written the introduction to "Bemmo," the treatise against Christianity of which mention has already been made.

It was now necessary to get the consent of the Central Government. Mr. Neesima went to Tokyo, where he saw Mr. Tanaka, the Minister of Education. It was with him that Mr. Neesima had been most closely associated while with the embassy. At first the Minister said that it would be impossible to grant permission for the founding of a Christian school in Kyoto, the stronghold of Buddhism. Finally, however, he yielded, after warning Mr. Neesima to be careful not to do anything that would arouse the prejudice of the people. Messrs. Neesima and Yamamoto then formed the company that for many years consisted of only themselves, and chose for it the name "Doshisha" or "Same Purpose Company." Rev. J. D. Davis, who had done much of the planning for the institution, was engaged as its first foreign teacher. He went to Kyoto in October, and in the house that was hired for him began holding Bible-classes every Sunday.

The Buddhist priests soon learned of what was being planned, and held many large and excited meetings to decide what they could do to prevent their holy city from being defiled by the foreign religion. They finally forwarded a protest to the Central Government. The power of Buddhism was so great in Kyoto that the local officials feared to encounter the enmity of the priests and became less friendly to Mr. Neesima. They summoned him to explain the meaning of the word "*Seisho*" \(Holy Scriptures\) which appeared in the list of studies. Soon a request came from the Governor that for a time the Bible should not be taught in the school. To this Mr. Neesima assented. The Governor said that Christianity might be taught under the name of Moral Science, and that direct Biblical instruction could be given to the students in the homes of the teachers. He added that an uprising of the Satsuma men was feared and that the excitement aroused by the establishment of the school would be utilised by them for gaining adherents. The Shinto officials united with the Buddhists in trying to bring pressure upon the Government to keep out the missionaries. A few foreigners living in the city were encouraging the Buddhists. A physician from Holland who was employed in a hospital told the missionaries that they might as well try to throw Mt. Hiei into Lake Biwa as to start a Christian school in Kyoto. Yet it was started, and as Mr. Davis wrote, "The acorn is in the bottle, and it will in time, with God's blessing, split the bottle." In a letter dated November 29, 1875, he also wrote: "We began our school this morning in Mr. Neesima's house at eight. o'clock with a prayer-meeting in which all the scholars took part; then going to the school-house, two others were received, making seven boarding scholars and one day scholar." That winter the number of students increased to about forty.

Most of the first pupils in the Doshisha were Christians that had come from the churches already established in other cities. The membership of the Kobe Church had doubled in the first year and that of the Osaka Church had nearly done the same, while in July a church had been organised in Sanda. Mr. Davis had written in October:

"The Kobe Church now numbers thirty-two members, twenty men and twelve women. Of these twenty men, thirteen have from the time they were received into the church or before been preachers of the Word,—not paid as native helpers by the Mission, but going out on the Sabbath, and during the week, and on tours of ten days, at their own charges, to preach. Regular preaching has been and is now kept up by them weekly in five different places, and monthly in about as many more. They have gone on foot to do this, or have paid for carriage hire and other expenses out of their very limited means, refusing foreign money to do it."

Dr. Taylor, in company with one of the members of the Kobe Church, had visited in July, 1875, the city of Okayama, about eighty miles west of Kobe. In the ten days spent there, he saw large numbers of patients. Preaching services were held every evening; at first in the hotel, and afterwards at the house of the principal of the high school. The hospital desired Dr. Taylor to come for permanent residence in the city. He expressed his willingness to do this if the necessary permission for himself and family could be gained from the Central Government. When the passport came, however, it was for only Dr. Taylor himself, it being said that Mrs. Taylor and the children would be of no assistance to the hospital. Before arrangements for including them in the passport were completed, it was decided that Dr. Taylor should become a teacher in the Doshisha School. The acquaintances made at Okayama helped, however, to open the way by which, three years later, other workers entered that city.

Dr. Palm of the Edinburgh Medical Mission removed in 1875 to Niigata, where he began medical and evangelistic work. For three months a Japanese evangelist who accompanied him preached daily in Dr. Palm's house. Though much interest was manifested, there was also considerable opposition, the influence of Buddhism being very strong in that region. About the close of the year, in response to a request made to the Yokohama Church, Mr. Oshikawa Masayoshi was sent to Niigata to carry on the work already begun. Mr. Fyson, of the Church Missionary Society, also took up his residence in Niigata.

In May, Rev, W. Dening, of the Church Missionary Society, opened a service in what had formerly been a large shop on the main street of Hakodate. On the second Sunday he baptised in the presence of a large crowd Mr. Ogawa, who afterwards became a prominent evangelist. Soon after this, active opposition began, Mr. Ogawa being annoyed and persecuted in many ways. Mr. Dening wrote, June 24:

"The Governor and other local authorities were excessively annoyed that I had obtained the use of a house on the main street. Hitherto all Christian services have been carried on in somewhat obscure quarters of the town—usually in the missionary's house. This is the first time that Christianity has been exposed to public view, as it were, in Hakodate. The young convert Ogawa, who took the house on my behalf, was called up by the authorities, again and again threatened, and charged not to allow any teaching or preaching in the name of Jesus in his house. He informed them he could not obey their commands, that he believed in Christianity himself, and wished to make it known to others, and he could not interfere wish my work. I have reason for believing that the whole matter was referred to Tokyo; but no steps have been taken to carry the opposition further. But the Governor forbade the people to attend the service, frequently sent spies, and once came himself to see who were present."

In March, 1875, a Shinto priest had addressed the following memorial to the Vice-Minister of Religion:

"It has been ordered by the Government that religious tenets are left to the option of the people, and directions have been given to the teachers of both Shintoism and Buddhism whereby they are caused to guide the people in accordance with the 'three articles of religion.' I have, however, heard that of late in the foreign settlements in our country, foreign religious precepts are being incessantly promulgated, and that our people are in a friendly way enticed thereby. Now, such teachings as these, from the very commencement, hold lord and father in light regard, and eventually cause men to fall into the habit of setting at naught their ruler and of disregarding their parents. The fact of this teaching being pernicious to the Empire is a matter needing from the very first no discussion. I have been told of this, and am unfortunately too unworthily holding a minor office of religious instruction, and am thus unable to refrain from slight consideration as to whether it would be a source of trouble were I, at the time of my expounding religious precepts, to publicly throw open to reproach the foreign doctrines. I beg that you will promptly give me clear directions, and so humbly beg to make the above interrogation."

To this the Department of Religion replied:

"Permission is granted according to the enquiry above. However, in matters outside the province of religion, careful attention must, of course, be paid that no hindrance shall arise of such a nature as to affect the public \(i.e., international\) relations of the Government."\*

An elder and about ten members of the Shinsakae-bashi Presbyterian Church in Tokyo withdrew from it in 1875, and formed themselves into an independent body to which they gave the name "Japan Church." According to the historian of the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\): "The motive of organising this new church consisted in enforcing an extreme anti-foreign principle of independence, because all the churches at those times were under the assistance of foreign churches and missionaries, who had naturally a great influence in those churches." In 1883 these Christians united with others to form the Reinanzaka Church, the first of the Kumi-ai \(Congregational\) body that was organised in Tokyo.\*

In June Mr. Ing baptised fourteen young men in Hiro-saki, the fruit of his own labours and those of Mr. Honda Yuitsu, a member of the Kaigan Church in Yokohama. These Christians wrote to that church in August asking that they might be organised as a church. The request being granted, the Hirosaki Church was formed and Mr. Honda was made its elder. In 1876 it became associated with the Methodist body.†

Besides these churches and the one in Sanda already mentioned, those organised in 1875 were one in Hoden, a suburb of Tokyo, that was connected with the Presbyterian Mission, and one in Tokyo connected with the Methodists. The Methodist Mission also organised its first quarterly conference.

December 27, 1875, appeared the first Christian newspaper. It bore the name *Shichi Ichi Zappo* \(Weekly News\) and was edited by Rev. O. H. Gulick of the American Board Mission.

Early in March, 1876, the Government issued a decree that from the beginning of the next month Sunday should be the official day of rest. We have already seen how the foreign teachers resisted the attempt to force upon them another system of holidays. Some other Europeans and Americans in the employ of the Government had also insisted upon having their Sundays; and the convenience of the offices demanded that Japanese and foreigners should rest upon the same day. The Government, of course, did not have any religious motives for adopting the new system; but the observance of Sunday as a holiday in offices, schools, and to some extent in business houses, has proved a great help to missionary work.

On the last Sunday of January, 1876, a number of young men from the city of Kumamoto went to a hill on the outskirts of the town, where they entered into a solemn covenant, pledging themselves to follow Christ and "to enlighten the darkness of the Empire by preaching the Gospel, even at the sacrifice of their lives." They were pupils of a school in which Captain Janes, a retired officer of the United States Army, had for several years been a teacher of English. During the first part of his connection with the school he had said nothing about Christianity; but he had won a great influence over his pupils. After he had been a year or two in Kumamoto he offered to teach the Bible in his own house to any that would like to study it. There was much difference of opinion among the students about what they should do. Most of them said that they ought not to have anything to do with a book that taught such evil doctrines as those of the Christians; a few said that out of courtesy to a teacher who had treated them so kindly, they ought to accept his invitation; while some others held that, as knowledge of an enemy is the first step towards victory over him, they, whose duty it would probably be to prevent Christianity from getting a hold upon the hearts of the people, must find out what it taught, so that they might intelligently oppose it. At first ten of the pupils went to study the Bible, and afterwards they were joined by others. Ere long, some of these became convinced of the truth of Christianity, Among these were Messrs. Miyagawa Tsuneteru, Ebina Danjo, Yokoi Tokio, Kanamori Tsurin, Shimomura Kotaro, Morita Kumando,\* and others who afterwards were prominent in Christian work. Finally there were over forty who, as above narrated, met to pledge themselves to God's service.

As soon as this became known, there was great excitement, not only in the school, but throughout the city. The young men were persecuted by their fellow-students and by members of their own families. Most of them were called home by their parents. Their Bibles were burned, and they were told not to touch such books again. The widowed mother of one student told him that, as he had shown lack of reverence for his ancestors by action that brought disgrace upon the family, he ought, if unwilling to give up the evil religion, to slay himself with a sword. As he showed no signs of yielding, she took the sword and made preparations for killing herself; but the servants ran out and summoned help to prevent her from carrying out her purpose. A few years later she herself became an earnest Christian, When one father drew his sword and threatened to kill his son, the latter bent forward his head, thus expressing his willingness to receive the blow. Another student, after being imprisoned for a hundred days, was cast out from his home. Some of the young men yielded to the opposition, but about thirty stood firm. Most of them soon went to the Doshisha School in Kyoto to prepare for Christian work. They were known as the "Kumamoto Band," and several of them became prominent leaders in the church.\*

This movement among students in the southern island had in the far north what was in some respects its counterpart, though without the bitter persecution. Among the teachers employed by the Government was Colonel W. S. Clark, President of the Massachusetts Agricultural College, who temporarily left his own school in order that he might help to organise a similar institution in Sapporo. From the first, he tried by word and deed to exert a Christian influence. Among other duties he was expected to teach ethics, and when some of the Japanese officials objected to his saying anything about religion, he held up a Bible, saying: "If I am to teach morality, I must insist on having this as a text-book." Being one of those men who quickly win confidence and are able to carry their own way, he soon overcame opposition. Not only was his teaching in the school permeated with Christian thought, but on Sundays he preached the Gospel directly to those who would come to his house and listen. He gained a great influence over the students, and though he remained in Sapporo only about a year, his whole class, fifteen in number, signed a covenant whose opening paragraph was as follows:

"The undersigned, members of Sapporo Agricultural College, desiring to confess Christ according to His command, and to perform with true fidelity every Christian duty in order to show our love and gratitude to that blessed Saviour who has made atonement for our sins by His death on the cross; and earnestly wishing to advance His Kingdom among men for the promotion of His glory and the salvation of those for whom He died, do solemnly covenant with God and with each other from this time forth to be his faithful disciples and to live in strict compliance with the letter and the spirit of His teachings; and whenever a suitable opportunity offers, we promise to present ourselves for examination, baptism, and admission to some evangelical church."

The young men were so earnest that, when another class entered the school, they tried "to convert the Freshies by storm," as is declared by one of the latter, who also describes his own efforts to resist their unwelcome persuasions to accept the new faith. The writer finally yielded; for, he says, "The public opinion of the college was too strong against me. . . . They forced me to sign the covenant."\* He with his classmates swelled the number of covenanters to thirty. They formed the basis of what became the Independent Church of Sapporo.

The church in Kobe received a request from two men living in Matsuyama, a city about two hundred miles distant on the island of Shikoku, asking that some one be sent to preach the Christian religion to themselves and their friends. There being no one who could go for permanent residence, Rev. J. L. Atkinson, a missionary of the American Board, decided that he would visit the city, and the church voted to pay the expenses of two of its members who should accompany him. Just as they were about to start, a letter came asking them to delay a few days. After waiting a month, it was decided about the end of March, 1876, to start at once, since the time covered by Mr. Atkinson's passport for travel in the interior, was fast slipping away. At the port where they landed from the steamer they received a letter from the brother of the man with whom they had been in correspondence, saying that he was away from home. Mr. Atkinson with one of his companions remained in the place where they were, while the other evangelist went on to Matsuyama, about three miles distant. He found that there had been a quarrel in the family of the man that had invited them, and also that there was considerable excitement in the city over the report that Christian teachers were coming. The Shinto and Buddhist priests had been in consultation to devise means for averting the threatening evil. On the other hand, the Governor of the district had received notice that a foreigner who was coming to the city would probably teach Christianity, and care must be taken that there was no disturbance. Some of the officials arranged for a meeting at which they desired Mr. Atkinson to speak to them. After several meetings had been held in small rooms, a house that would hold three hundred and fifty people was hired and notices of the services were posted upon the streets. The rooms were usually crowded with attentive hearers. About a fortnight was spent in Matsuyama and several days in Imabari, a city about thirty miles distant. Thus were the beginnings made of a work that in after years made these two cities centres of Christian influence.

The proof afforded by this trip that some parts, at least, of the interior were open to the Gospel, was the more welcome because in January, Mr. Imamura Kenkichi, a member of the Kobe Church, and afterwards well known as a Christian publisher, was summoned before the courts for giving away Christian tracts while visiting Kanazawa Prefecture the previous autumn. It was at the instance of the Governor of that prefecture that he was called to account and was closely questioned as to who wrote the tracts, who printed them, whether the foreigners gave them to him, etc. It was not until June that he was declared free from blame.

A Christian of Yokohama while on his way to Niigata was surprised to find in Ueda \(Shinshu\), more than a hundred miles west of Yokohama, a little company of believers. Only two of them had ever met a missionary or listened to Christian preaching. Both of these had heard a little in Tokyo, and one of them also in Nagasaki. They had carried back to their homes information of what they had learned, and though one of them had met much opposition from the members of his family, there were several persons who had been impressed with the truths thus brought to their notice, and they desired to receive fuller instruction. In August, Rev. and Mrs. E. R. Miller went to Ueda, and after spending some time there Mr. Miller baptised fifteen persons. Later in the year Mr. Ballagh baptised several others and organised a church, the first one established at any great distance from an open port.

A few other churches were organised in 1876, Among them were three in the city of Kyoto, most of the members being students of the Doshisha.

About the beginning of the year 1877 a Japanese Christian received from the Government permission to translate and publish Williamson's "Natural Theology," This is worthy of notice because, so far as known, it was the first permission given for the publication of a distinctively Christian book.\*

The work was spreading into the interior in various directions. In January, Rev. G. M. Meacham, of the Canadian Methodist Mission, who had been teaching in Numazu, baptised the principal of the school, two other teachers, and three pupils. A colporteur connected with the American Methodists had visited Shinshu Province, and it was in part a result of his labours that earnest invitations came from several cities asking that they be visited by a missionary. In October and November, Rev. I. H. Correll made a tour through the province and established in Matsumoto and other cities classes for religious instruction. Rev. J. Soper, of the same mission, visited the province of Shimosa where, in the city of Ajiki, he organised a class of twelve candidates for baptism. Earlier in the year, Rev. J. L. Atkinson, of the American Board Mission had made an extensive tour along the northern shore of the Inland Sea and in Shikoku, finding promising openings at almost every place he visited. He made arrangements by which several students of the Doshisha Theological School spent their summer vacation in the most important towns. Another of these students spent the vacation in Annaka, Mr. Neesima's former home, where at the close of the summer, fifteen persons banded themselves together in a Christian company.

At one place visited by Mr. Atkinson, the Buddhist priests decided that the best way to oppose the Christian religion would be to get the people to sign a pledge that they would have nothing to do with its teachers. This method was frequently adopted by the priests in later years; and they usually found it easy to get large numbers to promise that they would not attend Christian meetings, and that they would cease to have social or business relations with any person that accepted the hated religion. The following is a specimen of these pledges:

"Christianity is calculated to disturb the minds of the people and diminish the power of the Empire. When that religion prevailed in Japan many years ago, several feudal lords and numbers of their followers were induced to join. It was soon ascertained that the Christians plotted the overthrow of the Government and deposition of the Emperor; therefore, Christianity was prohibited. The Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu suppressed the foreign creed and slaughtered several hundreds of thousands of those who professed Christianity. Now, however, it appears that this false religion may be introduced to our village, and those who adopt it will be inspired with rebellious notions, from which great calamities must ensue. Therefore we agree that if any native of this village becomes a Christian, we will cease to have any intercourse with him, and if any person dwelling here, not being a native, embraces the foreign creed, we will send him back to his birthplace."\*

Sometimes the people of their own accord made similar engagements. In one place several persons signed a paper in which they agreed that if any of the number became a Christian, the others might say anything, however bad, against him, and his signature would be their guaranty against his taking legal or other redress.

The missionaries who visited the interior were obliged to obtain passports from the Imperial Government. These were granted only for "health" or for "scientific investigation," the object of the restriction probably being to prevent foreigners from going into the country to trade. It became a practical question with missionaries whether they were justified in using passports thus worded. While the Foreign Department was unwilling to change the form of the documents or to make a public definition of how the words were to be interpreted, the heads of the Department at different times gave unofficial assurances that missionaries might use the passports for religious work. By most of the latter this was taken as being the equivalent of an official definition of the words; but some others felt that they could not conscientiously use such passports for evangelistic tours.

Foreigners were not allowed to reside in the interior except as they were employed by Japanese. In such cases it was necessary to have written contracts that were approved by both the local and the Imperial governments. Some missionaries accepted positions as teachers, and they usually found that no serious obstacles were put in the way of their improving the opportunities for doing religious work that came from their residence in the interior.

In the spring of 1876 the missionaries of the Presbyterian Church in the United States \(North\), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland formed the "Council of the Three Missions" made up of two delegates from each mission. One of its chief objects was to effect a union of the Japanese churches that had been formed in connection with their labours. The rules drawn up by this council, and adopted by the churches, recommended the Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Westminster Confession of Faith, and the Canons of the Synod of Dort, as the standards of doctrine; and the rules of church government were modelled upon those of Presbyterian churches in the West, though somewhat changed so as to suit Japanese conditions. The name adopted for the new body signified "The United Church of Christ in Japan." A few years later the word "United" was dropped from the title. The first meeting of the new organisation was held in Yokohama, October 3, 1877, Besides the missionaries, there were eight elders representing the same number of churches. These churches had a membership of six hundred and twenty-three. Requests were received for the organisation of three new churches.

At this meeting, three persons were ordained to the Christian ministry. Their names were Okuno Masatsuna, Ogawa Yoshiyasu, and Toda Tadaatsu.

Mr. Okuno was born in Yedo in 1823. He belonged to the military class, both his own father and the man that afterwards adopted him being vassals of the Tokugawa Shoguns. At the time of the overthrowal of the Shogunate he was serving as an official in the household of Ninnoji no Miya, the uncle of the Emperor Mutsuhito. An attempt was made to set up this prince as a rival emperor, and Mr. Okuno was among those that joined the army raised for this purpose by the northern daimyos. This movement soon ended in failure. Mr. Okuno, who was reduced to poverty, was still loyal to the house of his former master and longed to see it restored to its former prosperity. As a help in bringing this about, he had recourse to fasting and penance. He resolved to offer up petitions for help at all the Shinto shrines in Yedo. Setting out in the winter, he repeated his prayers at each shrine and poured cold water over his body. In fifty days the number of these ablutions had amounted to ten thousand. Sometimes he fasted for periods of seven days, eating absolutely nothing. He became so weak that he depended on his friends to help him as he crawled from one place to another; yet on arriving in front of a shrine, he would pour bucketful after bucketful of ice-cold water over his head until his skin turned black and his emaciated body could hardly be kept from falling. When the bamboo tallies with which he kept account of the number of douches had been used up, his friends would help him to some house where they would seek to restore vitality to his almost frozen body. After he had visited five hundred shrines in this way, he returned to his family. His prayers and intercessions had been in vain, and his friends undertook to find out why the gods had not granted his desires. Thus it was ascertained that in his weakness he had sometimes failed to reach a shrine at the proper time. He therefore went over the whole weary round once more; but still the gods were unmoved. He told his friends that his efforts were vain and he could do no more. He had spent their money and his for naught; he had starved himself to a skeleton and almost destroyed his life; but not one comforting response had come from any of the gods.\* Soon after this he found employment with Dr. Hepburn, helping him in the preparation of his dictionary. Being thus brought under Christian influences, he at last became a believer in the truths of the Gospel, and he ever after showed a spirit as earnest as marked the days when he sought help by pilgrimages and penances.

Mr. Ogawa, like Mr. Okuno, became one of the leaders in the church. He was born in 1831 and belonged to the military class. Becoming Dr. Thompson's teacher and so a helper in the translation of the Bible, he was greatly moved by its truths and was thus led to a belief in Christ.

Earlier in the year \(February\) another earnest young man had been ordained as pastor of the Naniwa Church, which at the same time was organised in the city of Osaka. Rev. Paul Sawayama was born in 1851 in the province of Suwo. During the Revolution he fought against the Shogun's army, and soon after the restoration of peace came to Kobe, where he studied English with Rev. D. C. Greene. In 1872 he went to America, finding a home in the family of Mr. Greene's brother, who lived in Evanston, 111. While there, he united with the First Congregational Church of that city, and decided that he would devote his life to preaching the Gospel. On returning to Japan in 1876, he was offered a government position at a salary of one hundred and fifty *yen* a month, which was a very large sum at that time; but he chose instead to become pastor of the little flock in Osaka, which could pay him only the paltry sum of seven *yen.* He was a man of deep faith, an earnest preacher, and one that exerted a great influence over all that met him. He and Mr. Neesima were the Japanese who did most to lay the foundations of what afterwards became the Kum-ai body of churches \(Congregational\). Though feeble health often kept him from the pulpit, yet in the sickroom or the ward of the hospital he was a great spiritual power. Other Christian workers went to him for advice and help to such an extent that he was often called "a pastor of pastors." He was an earnest advocate of self-support for the native churches. His own church was noted for its readiness to contribute not only for its own expenses, but for carrying the Gospel to others. He died in 1887 but his memory is still a power for good among all who knew him. His biography under the title, "A Modern Paul in Japan" was written by Mr. Naruse Jinzo.

In connection with the union of the Presbyterian churches, a committee was chosen to arrange a plan for theological education. As a result a school was established in Tokyo and put under the care of the Council of the Three Missions, This did away with the former practice by which each mission had sought to educate young men for its own ministry. In November, 1877, Rev. H. Maundrell of the Church Missionary Society began in Nagasaki a school to train candidates for the ministry, there being at first four students.

A difficulty that was often experienced is illustrated by the trouble that the Christians of Kyoto had in renting a building for their meetings, which had hitherto been held in private houses. Rev. J. D. Davis, writing in November, 1877, said:

"For three months they tried and failed. As soon as it was known that they were Christians, the way was blocked. Some three months ago they found a very desirable building for rent near the centre of the city, and the owner, and the mayor of the ward also, consented to rent it for Gospel preaching. In Japan, however, the neighbours must be consulted before a man can rent a house, and the neighbours in this case, hearing that it was to be rented for Christian preaching, refused their consent and sent word to the owner of the house in question, who lived in another ward, that he must not rent his house to a Christian. He replied that if the house belonged to them they could control it, but while it belonged to him he should rent it to whomsoever he pleased, and that if they did not like this they could buy the house. So they had a consultation and sent him word that they would buy it. Twenty days elapsed and they did not pay for it; and then they sent word to the owner that, since they heard that this Christian expected to rent a house in another place, they had decided not to purchase. The owner at once rented the house to one of the native Christians and he took possession, and preaching services were commenced. The neighbours were now greatly troubled and held meeting after meeting before they could decide what to do. Most of them wanted to eject the Christian, though some said they wanted to learn the New Way. The majority would not, however, vote to buy the house. Finally they fell back upon an old custom or law, which originated in the time of the persecution of the Jesuits here, that every man who rented a house must write in the lease to what sect of Buddhists he belonged. The Christian who rented this house had written in the lease that he was formerly a Buddhist but now a Christian. The neighbours said that unless this Christian could bring a paper from a priest of the sect of Buddhists to which he formerly belonged, saying that such was the case, he could not hold the lease. The Christian refused to pay any attention to this demand, and after their threatening the owner and the man who had rented it and also troubling the mayor of the ward for some time, the latter had a private interview with the Governor of the city to enquire what he had better do. The Governor advised him to order that the Christian simply write himself as a Christian and that one or two other men become responsible that if he should die they would see that the neighbours were not troubled about his burial, since, as a Christian, he could not receive regular Buddhist burial."

In 1875 Dr. J. C. Berry had obtained through the American Minister permission to visit prisons in different parts of Japan. The results of his inspection were embodied in a report that he made in 1876 to the Japanese Government, adding many suggestions about needed improvements. The Government had the report printed and distributed among the prison officials, a fact the more noticeable since it included the testimony of many European and American penologists upon the value of Christian teaching as a reformatory agent. The Governor of Kobe appointed a member of the church in that city as a teacher in the prison to give instruction in reading, arithmetic, and morals. Though not appointed as a chaplain, he found many opportunities to exert a Christian influence. Early in 1877 this man received a document from eight of the prisoners. The cover was of ordinary paper; but in the centre was a wreath of flowers painted in colours, in the centre of this wreath was a cross, and on the cross were four Chinese ideographs that signified "The Company of the New Covenant." Within the covers was written an agreement saying that the persons whose names were signed at its close entered into a solemn covenant with each other and with God to cease from all violations of the law of God and of the land, and to follow Jesus as their Saviour. At the end each man wrote his name, and then as they had no seals, they did what is recognised as lawful under such circumstances, dipped the ends of their thumbs in ink and impressed them on the paper. The man that taught these prisoners was afterwards made the superintendent of the prison.

Early in 1877 Mr. Neesima sent some Christian books to the prison at Otsu, about eight miles from Kyoto. Among them was Dr. Martin's "Evidences of Christianity" in Chinese, the book to whose influence reference has several times before been made. This so interested one of the prisoners that he began to translate it into Japanese for the benefit of his illiterate associates, whom he began to instruct. Mr. Neesima wrote an account of what followed:

"Most of the prisoners are uneducated, and petty thieves. A lamp was allowed for evening study. This was a great concession from the authorities, for the use of lamps had hitherto been forbidden. But one lamp proved insufficient for the large number of prison students. I believe they were eighty in number. Subsequently one more was granted, then another, then another, till finally the room was fully lighted. He who taught his associates also began to preach to them every day. One day fire broke out in the prison, but there was no least confusion. He kept them in complete order. Under his direction each one work nobly and soon the fire was extinguished. Afterwards the prisoners were inspected, and none of them had escaped. It was a wonderful thing. The authorities of the city were informed of the behaviour of the prisoners and the reason for it, and their leader was released on account of his good conduct, although he had one year yet to serve. After his release he called on us and told us his story. He had killed a man ten years ago in a quarrel. He has since started a private school in Otsu, and Mr. Davis, myself, and some of the students have preached there ever since."\*

Departing from the chronological order of events, we may here insert one or two other incidents connected with work for prisoners. The first relates to a young man who failed in an attempt to inaugurate such work. He was a student in the Doshisha School. While there, his conscience troubled him because a few years before, when a boy in Tokyo, he had stolen some shoes from a hotel. He finally decided to confess his crime and take the consequences. Supposing that he would have to spend considerable time in prison, he began to think where he could do the most good. As no Christian work had yet been done in the province of Satsuma, he decided to seek imprisonment there in order that he might preach Christ to those that were confined with him. He left school without telling any one of his plans, and went to Satsuma. From there he wrote letters to two leading newspapers in Tokyo telling of the theft committed years before, of his remorse of conscience since he had been taught by Christians, and his desire to make all the restitution in his power. He then gave himself up to the officers of justice for punishment. He was detained a few days and then, much to his surprise, was released, the authorities scarcely knowing what to make of such a conscience. Thus his plan for Christian work in a prison ended in failure.\*

The prisoners at this time furnished a more hopeful field of labour because they contained, especially after the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, a number of political prisoners, who were intellectually and morally of a higher grade than most criminals. The labour of the convicts was often let out to farmers and manufacturers. In Kobe a Christian had established a small factory and he employed some of these political prisoners to run the machines. He began to speak to them about Christianity, had some one read the Bible or other books while they were working, and once a week invited some preacher to address them. The official that accompanied these prisoners made no objection, and some of the men became very much interested in what they heard. After a time, business grew so dull that the employer could no longer afford to keep his machines going; but the prisoners were so desirous of continuing the arrangement that one or two of them, who were men of property, furnished funds to enable him to continue hiring them and their companions through the dull season. Several of them were baptised after their sentences had expired, and on returning to their own province opened the way there for Christian preaching.

The Cumberland Presbyterian Church of America, which formerly had done most of its foreign work through the American Board, to which it contributed both money and men,† now began a mission of its own in Japan. Rev. and Mrs. J. B. Hail, its first representatives, reached the country in February, 1877, and Osaka was selected as their residence. To the same city in April came Miss M. J. Oxlad, the first representative of the English Society for Promoting Female Education in the East. The Evangelical Association of North America had sent its first missionaries \(Rev. F. Krecker, M.D., Mrs. Krecker, Rev. A. Halmhuber, and Miss R. J, Hudson\) to Japan the preceding year. They at first resided in Yokohama.

The year 1878 was marked by a number of conventions that in various ways showed the progress that was being made. The earliest of these was a meeting of delegates sent by the nine churches that had grown up in connection with the work of the American Board. It was held in Osaka January 2 and 3. Its purpose was to promote fellowship among the churches and to devise plans for uniting their forces for spreading the Gospel. Besides the delegates, many Christians living in the vicinity were in attendance. Mr. Neesima was the chairman. The most important business accomplished was the establishment of the Japanese Missionary Society, the churches promising to make monthly contributions for its support. The management of this society was wholly in the hands of the Japanese, and at first it did not receive any financial aid from the mission. The next summer it sent several theological students from the Doshisha to places where there were promising openings, and in these they laid the foundations of what have since become large churches.

In May the missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the American Episcopal Mission met in Tokyo for a conference. Two bishops and fifteen other clergymen were in attendance. They decided that the Japanese churches formed in connection with their work should use the same Book of Common Prayer, For this the translations already made of the Litany and of the services of Morning and Evening Prayer were adopted, and a committee was chosen for the translation of other portions.

May 10-13 a convention of missionaries was held in Tokyo. As this was a delegate convention, it is not reckoned as one of the "General Conferences." Besides forty-one missionaries representing ten missions, each of the three Bible societies \(British and Foreign, Scotch, and American\) working in Japan sent a delegate, and there were three honorary members. The chief business related to the translation of the Old Testament. It was decided that each mission should be requested to appoint one of its members to serve upon a permanent committee that should have authority to select committees for translation and general revision.

The first *Dai Shimboku-kwai,* or General Fellowship Meeting, for all the Protestant Christians of Japan was held in Tokyo, July 15-18. Twelve cities were represented by twenty-seven delegates; and it is said that from five hundred to six hundred people were present at some of the meetings. Mr. Tsuda Sen was chosen Chairman. There were reports from the churches and addresses upon such subjects as "The Spirit of Christian Fellowship," "Christians should be Independent," "The Church and the Nation," "Christianity and Literature," "Christianity and Social Reform," "Christianity and Liberty," etc. Much enthusiasm was manifested and it was a great advantage to have the Christians of different churches thus brought together. It was decided to have such meetings annually. The next year, however, the prevalence of cholera in the city of Osaka, which had been chosen for the place of meeting led to a postponement until 1880. These Fellowship Meetings, either under the original name or as meetings of the Japanese Evangelical Alliance, have been held at irregular intervals until the present time.

The Presbytery of the United Churches, held in October, elected, besides the Home Evangelisation Committee, a Foreign Evangelisation Committee of six members. The plan was to begin evangelistic work in Korea. The Committee, having obtained a man that desired to labour in that country, had him enter upon a course of theological study; but the candidate was obliged on account of illness to leave the seminary and the whole enterprise was dropped for the time being.

In January, 1878, the two Congregational \(or *Kumi-ai,* as they were afterwards called\), churches in Osaka, each having about twenty-five members, opened the school for girls to which was given the name Baikwa Jogakko \(Plum-blossom Girls' School\). Rev. H. Leavitt, a missionary of the American Board, was an earnest advocate of self-support, believing that the Christians should not depend on foreign funds for the expenses of churches, schools, publishing houses, or other Christian institutions. It was chiefly owing to his zeal, seconded by that of Rev. Paul Sawayama, that the enthusiasm, faith, and courage of the Christians were aroused for this undertaking which at first seemed far beyond their strength. Though individual missionaries showed their sympathy by personal contributions, no money was asked from the missionary board. Mr. Leavitt wrote: "The running expenses of the school—including rent of building, fuel, teacher, etc., etc.,—are paid entirely by the tuition of the scholars and the contributions of the church members." The American Board Mission allowed one of its lady missionaries to teach in the school, but gave it no pecuniary aid. At first there were fifteen pupils, a number that increased rapidly from month to month. It may be added that for about fifteen years the school continued upon this self-supporting basis; and then, in view of the financial straits into which the school was brought by the dishonesty of the man in whose name the real estate was held, the American Board made it one or two grants.

A number of new churches were organised in 1878, several of them being outside of the open ports. One of these was in Annaka, Mr. Neesima's old home, where it will be remembered that he spoke to the people about Christianity at the time of his return from America. Mr. Ebina, a student of the Doshisha Theological School, had spent his vacations there as an evangelist. In March, 1878, a church was organised. Mr. Neesima thus wrote of the exercises:

"When I arrived there, I found them well prepared to be baptised. I held a meeting on the evening of my arrival, preached to a large audience the next day, and held an enquiry meeting in the evening. This was repeated the following day, and on the fourth day I baptised thirty persons and organised a church. It was the most solemn and yet most joyful event I ever witnessed. The people have thus far paid all expenses and have never received any aid from without. They take pride in doing so, and have already raised a fund for the support of their church. There is a rich merchant among them, the most influential man in the place, although quite young. He keeps the pastor in his home and does everything for his comfort. He also supports a free reading-room where daily, weekly, and monthly papers, secular and religious, are kept."

In the province of Shimosa, Mr. Soper of the American Methodist Mission, baptised thirty adults, who were organised into a church. In connection with the work of the same mission, six converts were baptised in the important city of Nagoya and placed under the care of a native catechist.

Rev. D. Macdonald, M.D., of the Canadian Methodist Mission, had been employed for four years as a teacher in Shizuoka. He also practised medicine, and in his own house taught Christianity, Up to the time of his departure, one hundred and eighteen persons had been baptised. Rev. G, M. Meacham of the same mission, had lived for two years in Numazu. Forty-one persons, most of them students in the school where he taught, were baptised.

In Kyoto there was a wave of reaction. Some one wrote:

"Whereas there were upwards of forty places occupied each week by students as centres for presenting truth, with audiences always inspiring in number, now scarcely eight can be occupied with any encouraging number of hearers. In many places the houses are closed to the preachers."\*

There was also difficulty in getting permission for employing foreign teachers in the Doshisha Schools. Two ladies had come to teach in the Girls' Department, which had been recently established; but when the local Governor, who had become hostile, forwarded the request to the Central Government, he added a suggestion that it should not be granted, since the schools were used to promote Christianity. There was further trouble at a later date when it was necessary to have Dr. Learned's passport renewed. One objection suggested by the Governor was that, though Mr, Neesima nominally employed the foreign teachers, the school was really a foreign institution sustained by an annual grant from a missionary society. In February of the next year Mr. Neesima went to Tokyo where, since the passports must be obtained through the Foreign Department, he explained to Mr. Mori, the Vice-Minister, how the school was started and how it was sustained. After hearing his statement, Mr. Mori said: "You have a right to exist and also to employ foreign teachers, if you use your own funds instead of those coming from a foreign society. The Foreign Office objects to your depending upon the American Board." Mr. Neesima says:

"I told him that this annual aid was a free gift and that we made a good use of it. Is it forbidden us to receive any aid from a foreign nation? If so, the law ought to prohibit us from aiding other nations. Did not our people send an immense quantity of rice last year to a famishing district in China, and can we not also receive some aid for our moral and intellectual famine? This argument was just enough to bring him around to our side, and through his kindness I obtained the extension of Dr. Learned's passport for five years."

In the spring of 1878 Rev. F. B. Plummer of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, made a visit to the Bonin Islands, which are five hundred and fifty miles southeast of Yokohama. At this time the islands had a population of about a thousand persons, among them being English, French, Americans, Spanish, South Sea Islanders, Negroes, and cross-breeds. Webb, who was a leader among the foreign settlers, had been in the habit of baptising the children of all but one of the families. These islands, which belong to Japan, have since that time been frequently visited by missionaries.

A school for teaching the blind was opened that year at Tokyo in the hospital conducted by Dr. Faulds, who also about the same time caused some portions of the Scriptures and other Christian literature to be printed in raised type.\* Three years before this he had been in conference with several Japanese Christians who united with him in forming a philanthropic society, one of whose objects was the education of the blind. An official who was induced to join the society "strongly objected to its dependence on a foreign church for its support," and as his views were accepted, the society lost its distinctively Christian character, but gained contributions from the Emperor and others. The school for the blind and for deaf mutes established by this society was not opened until February, 1880, more than a year after that of Dr. Faulds, who continued to help the Japanese society in developing and carrying out its plans.

On certain Shinto festivals, sacred cars are carried through the streets upon the shoulders of men, who may number several scores. Often the car will suddenly stop, and though the men pretend to be trying to make it go forward, they will all be carried backward or swayed from side to side, the idea being that for some reason or other the god, whose spirit is supposed to be in the car, does not wish to go in the direction that is being taken. Sometimes the car strikes against a house whose inmates have in some way displeased the deity. In August, 1878, as the car belonging to the tutelary shrine of Yotsuya, Tokyo, was being carried in front of the Christian church that had been built in that district, the spirit of the deity became so turbulent that finally the car was hurled against the building with such violence as to do considerable damage. Soon after this, the persons in charge of the proceedings were called before the police, and as a result were led to write a document acknowledging that they had not exerted sufficient care, asking forgiveness for the offence, and promising that there should be no trouble next year. They also sent eighteen persons to offer apologies to the Christians. When a somewhat similar affair occurred in Kobe, the Shinto priests were warned that a recurrence would lead the authorities to prohibit the taking out of the car in future years.\*

Intercourse with Western lands brought to the Japanese not only a knowledge of Christianity, but also of modern materialism and scepticism. The letters of missionaries show that they quickly recognised the danger. Thus Rev. J. T. Gulick wrote:

"It becomes more and more evident that the strongest opponent to Christianity in Japan will not be Buddhism but materialism; not the religions and superstitions of old Japan but the scepticism of modern Europe. The faith of the people in their old religions is giving way gradually, and though the strong fraternities of priests and a large conservative element among the common people will be for a time resolutely arrayed against any change of religious opinions, their utmost endeavours cannot stay the tide. Though we should fail to do our part in urging the claims of Christianity, the old systems would not fail to crumble before the advance of modern ideas. But we must not deceive ourselves with the thought that in the absorption of new ideas Christianity will be as readily received as other things; for it becomes every day more apparent that the natural heart of progressive Japan is the eager disciple of rationalistic and materialistic Europe."

The scorn with which many looked on religion finds expression in the following extract from one of the leading newspapers, the *Hochi Shimbun,* of October 19, 1878;

"The Christian religion seems to be extending by degrees throughout our country. . . . We have no wish to obey it, nor have we any fear of being troubled by it. As we can enjoy sufficient happiness without any religion whatever, the question as to the merits or demerits of the different forms never enters our head. Indeed, we are of those who, not knowing the existence of religions in the universe, are enjoying perfect happiness. We have no intention of either supporting or attacking the Christian religion. In fact, religion is nothing to us."†

While many of the wise and noble thus despised Christianity, it was having its influence on publicans and sinners. Rev. O. H. Gulick, writing of a visit to Hikone, said:

"Two men widely known in that section of country as keepers of gambling saloons and houses of ill-fame, have within a few months become ashamed of their vile trade. Gathering the inmates of their establishments together, they announced their purpose to abandon the wicked business and follow the teachings of Christ. The women and girls, whom they had purchased from their parents and subjected to a life of degradation, they promised to set free without the return of money if they could find homes as wives or if they would return to their parents, giving pledges that they would abandon their lives of shame. We were told that all but one of the victims of their trade had in these ways been provided with homes, the business had been entirely closed, and those who were the organisers of this iniquity had become regular and attentive hearers of the word of life."\*

This was but one of many cases in which men were led to give up trades not consistent with Christian teaching, though to do so involved considerable loss.

In a small town in the province of Tango on the shores of the Japan Sea lived a woman whose story is here condensed from an account written by Rev. J. H. DeForest. She belonged to a family of some local importance, one of whose members had died in the year 1854. By the old calendar, which divided the years among cycles named after various animals, that was the year of the tiger, and when the next year of the same designation came around, the head of the family died. Superstitious as the Japanese are, the family and friends could not fail to be deeply impressed with the coincidence; and the two tombstones, both inscribed with the tiger year, made them regard it as one fatal to the household. In 1878 the dreaded season came again. At New Year's the family talked together of the terror that they could not but feel. "Whose turn will it be to die this year?" was the question they asked one another. Finally the widow of the man who had last died offered to take upon herself the wrath of the deities in order that the younger members of the household might be spared. To prepare herself for death she decided to make a pilgrimage to the great shrine at Ise, visiting other noted temples on the way. She set out attended by a single servant. On reaching Osaka she went to the house of her brother-in-law. This man and his wife had recently become Christians, and that night this widow for the first time heard about their religion. She tarried over another night that she might hear more of what they had to say. That they had torn down their idol-shelves, that they dared openly to profess a faith that she had been taught to dread, and that they seemed to be so full of joy in their new religion, led the old lady to say on the third day: "The weather is raw, the roads are bad. If the servant wants to continue on his pilgrimage to Ise, all right; I will stay here till his return and learn more about this religion."

She heard for a week, and gave a dollar to the church; two weeks, and she bought several dozen copies of the Scriptures and other books to take back home as presents; another week, and besides another dollar to the church, she gave one to the girls' school; still another week, and it was arranged that, since she felt hardly able to face the questions that would meet her at home, the relatives with whom she was staying should return with her. They did so, and though they were called before the police, they were allowed to continue telling the people of the town about Christianity. It was also arranged that one of the students of the Dushisha should spend his summer vacation there at the old lady's expense. Until the end of her life, about twenty years later, she was well known in the churches as the Tango Obaa San, or Old Lady of Tango. She built a church in her village and paid a large proportion of the expenses of the evangelists that laboured there.\*

Rev. C. T. Blanchet of the American Episcopal Missions, wrote in 1879: "The people are actually getting ready for Christianity faster than we can carry it to them." From towns far in the interior the missionaries of different societies were receiving invitations to come and preach the Gospel. Those that had the language found it easy to get large audiences. There were several places where the permanent residence of the missionary was desired; though this was possible only when he was employed by Japanese as a teacher of English, or in some other capacity. It was in this way that Rev. T. C. Winn went to Kanazawa as teacher in a government school. The principal offered him the position of English teacher with the understanding that he should be allowed to preach and to teach Christianity in the city. Mrs. Winn and Mrs. True, who accompanied him, were able to carry on work among the women; and as a result of these efforts a church was organised a year and a half later. Similarly, with a full understanding by the prefectural Governor and all other persons concerned that they came as Christian missionaries, J. C. Berry, M.D., and Revs. J, H. Pettee and O. Cary, were employed in Okayama, the first in a government hospital and the two others in a private school. They were accompanied by their families and Miss Wilson, all being of the American Board Mission. The Governor even went so far as to let them have free from rent, for temporary residence, a house that belonged to himself. This was also used for preaching services and a Sunday school. As it was well known to belong to him and as some of his family attended the services, much of the prejudice that would naturally be felt against the teachers of a foreign religion was allayed. The favours thus shown did indeed subject him to some criticism. The next year a comic paper published in Tokyo contained a picture that represented the Governor of Okayama as an acrobat balancing on his forehead a cross upon which was a pole labelled "Popular Favour." Underneath was the inscription: "The Governor of Okayama hopes to gain favour by becoming a Christian." Other papers asserted that he worshipped every day before a cross.

In other cities the labours of Japanese evangelists or the tours of missionaries were accompanied by encouraging results. The first class of young men, fifteen in number, was graduated from the Doshisha Theological School, and they at once became teachers or evangelists. From the cities where they laboured in the latter capacity, there soon came news of many persons who had become followers of Christ. In March, Rev. H. Maundrell of the Church Missionary Society, in response to an earnest invitation from Kagoshima, sent to that city one of the theological students under his training, who at once hired a room where he held services every evening and instructed those who, having before learned about Christianity, had asked for baptism. A visit was made a little later by Mr. Maundrell himself, and when he returned to Nagasaki in May, he left at Kagoshima a church with fourteen adults and seven children. There were also several others that had given in their names as desirous of becoming Christians.

Other missions reported many baptisms, and the statistics for the year 1879 showed an increase of about sixty per cent, in the number of Protestant church-members. With so much to encourage them and with so many promising openings, the missions called loudly for re-enforcements, and also felt deeply the need for raising up, as soon as possible, a thoroughly equipped native ministry.

Opposition, however, was not at an end. In Kyoto the local government instructed the ward officers to advise the people not to go to the houses of missionaries or to places where Christianity was preached, giving as a reason that the people already had a sufficient number of religions and those that were good enough.\* Two of the Japanese teachers in the Imperial High School in Osaka had been prominent workers in the churches. They were now forbidden to preach or teach Christianity, danger of overwork outside of school being the excuse for the order.†

This was one of several indications that the Department of Education was then, as for many years afterwards, opposed to Christianity.

Another form of opposition was in some respects harder to bear, since it came from those who had been born in Christian lands. Some of the foreign professors in the Imperial University at Tokyo, not only ridiculed Christianity in their classrooms, but also held meetings in a public hall, where they attacked Christianity and even theism.\*

In the summer of 1879 the peasants in a place near Niigata attacked Dr. Palm and demolished his preaching-place. This occurred in a riot, the people having gained the idea that the cholera, which was then raging, was in some way due to the Christians.

Missions were commenced in 1879 by the English Baptists and by the Reformed Church \(German\) in the United States. The next year the Methodist Protestant Church of America entered the field.

April 19, 1880, a meeting was held in one of the churches of Tokyo to celebrate the completion of the translation of the New Testament as made by the Committee chosen in 1872. A large audience of Japanese Christians, together with representatives of fourteen American and English missionary societies, filled the church. Dr. N. Brown of the American Baptist Mission, who a few months before had completed an independent translation of the New Testament, read the nineteenth Psalm in English, and Rev. J. Piper of the English Church Missionary Society offered prayer. The leading address was in English by Dr. Hepburn, who gave a historical sketch of former attempts to translate the Scriptures into Japanese, and of the way the present version was prepared. The chief work had been done by Drs. S. R. Brown, Greene, Hepburn, and Maclay; the Japanese brethren who assisted them and to whom much of the excellence of the version is due, being Messrs. Matsuyama Takayoshi, Okuno Masatsuna, Taka-hashi Goro, Ibuka Kajinosuke, and Miwa—Of the first of these it was said:

"He was with the Committee from the first, and throughout its whole work. He was our chief dependence, assistant, and arbiter in all cases of difficulty. Whatever virtue there is in our Japanese text is mainly, if not altogether, owing to his scholarly ability, the perfect knowledge he has of his own language, his conscientious care, and his identifying himself with the work."

Mr. Okuno, who was with the Committee a little more than two years, "had more to do in assisting in the first work of translation than perhaps any other."

The year that saw the completion of the translation saw also a great increase in the sale of the Scriptures. Rev. J. Goble, who was employed by the American Bible Society as a colporteur, had a small handcart made, which he stocked with books and so sold them through the streets of Tokyo and in different parts of the country. In the first month he sold about 5,500 portions of the Bible. Not only did he himself effect these large sales, but he proved to the Japanese that the people were ready to buy if approached in the right way, and many of the colporteurs, who hitherto had been too dignified to push their business, learned from him how to do successful work.

It will be remembered that in 1878 a convention of the Japanese Christians had been held in Tokyo. Plans were then made for having a similar meeting the next year in Osaka, but at the appointed time that city was suffering from an epidemic of cholera and so the convention was postponed until July, 1880. Though the expense of travel prevented the attendance of large numbers, the meeting was thought to be very profitable. Besides devotional meetings and addresses upon various themes, a half day was spent in making arrangements for presenting to the Government a petition asking that the Christian dead might be buried with Christian rites without let or hindrance from the Buddhist priests. Nothing, however, was gained at this time in furtherance of such liberty.

October 13 and 14 a remarkable meeting was held in the Public Park at Ueno, Tokyo. A restaurant with its grounds was rented and services held from nine o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon. There were prayers, the singing of Christian hymns, and addresses by both Japanese and foreigners. Dr. Verbeck thus described the exercises:

"In the forenoon, moderately sized audiences were addressed in the rooms of the restaurant; but towards noon the rooms, though pretty large, were found insufficient to hold the crowd of visitors then on the ground. The wide front veranda of the ground floor was now converted into a platform, the pretty gardens furnishing abundant room for the growing audience. The whole of this made up an impressive scene. In full view in front were the miniature lake of Shinobazu and the northern suburbs of the city; on a little island in the lake stood the temple dedicated to the goddess Benten; within hailing distance towards the left might be seen the temple of the thousand-handed goddess of mercy; within a stone's throw to the rear sat a bronze image of Buddha, twenty feet high; and in the midst of all these a large and orderly crowd stood attentively listening to the proclamation of the Gospel by a number of zealous preachers. White the principal work was done on the novel platform just described, a few preachers held overflow meetings under the summer-houses standing in different parts of the gardens. It is calculated that several thousand people, as they came and went, heard the preaching of the Gospel, many of them for the first time, on that day. It was gratifying to notice among the crowded audience the attendance of several representatives of the higher and official classes resident in the capital and the presence of Buddhist priests; the respectful bearing of all present, too, was a pleasant feature of the day's performance. The next day's local papers \(Japanese\) also, in their reports of the meeting, generally spoke of it with respect and approval. The promoters of this new enterprise had every reason to be satisfied with the result. For months afterwards one could hear, in Japanese churches, allusions made to the happy event, and thanks given to God for the blessings vouchsafed on this memorable day."\*

When we remember that only eight or nine years before it was dangerous to attend a Christian meeting in a private house, we see how great was the change that had taken place.

The liberal views of the Central Government were shown about this time by the orders it sent to one of the local governors. Some Japanese evangelists of the Greek Church had visited the province of Tamba, when the police, under orders from the Governor of Kyoto, to whose jurisdiction the district belonged, forbade their preaching. As they would not desist, the Governor reported the matter to Tokyo, only to receive commands to let the preachers alone. The same Governor had in many other ways shown his hatred of Christianity. It was on account of his opposition that there had been trouble in getting passports for the American teachers in the Doshisha, and he had issued orders that made booksellers afraid to deal in Christian books. It was a great relief to those interested in missionary work when he was soon after removed.

Two Japanese pastors obtained permission in September to speak every Sunday in the Hyogo prison. The document granting this gave "Moral Science" as the subject of their addresses; but it was well understood that they were at liberty to speak on religious themes.

The first Young Men's Christian Association among the Japanese was probably that organised this year in Tokyo. Rev, Messrs. Kozaki, Ibuka, Hiraiwa, and Uemura were prominent in the early days of the society. Meetings of its members were held for religious and philosophical discussions, a small library was formed, and there were occasional evangelistic services. It formed the foundation of the present Association in Tokyo. In October there was published under its auspices the *Rikugo Zasshi* \(The Cosmos\), a magazine that soon gained considerable circulation and influence. In this connection it may be noted that about the same time there was started in Kyoto a periodical entitled *Ryokyo Zasshi* \(The Magazine of the Two Religions\), which announced as its object the protection of Buddhism and Shintoism from the alarming advances being made by Christianity.

A letter written in July, 1881, by Rev. C. T. Blanchet of the American Episcopal Mission, mentions four indications of the rapid extension of Christianity;—1. The establishment, with the Government's approval, of a number of Christian papers. 2. The greater demand for Christian literature, and the rapidly increasing supply. 3. The renewed energy put forth by the Buddhists in trying to bolster up their system, which was daily losing its hold upon the people. 4, The tacit allowance by the Government of preaching the Gospel and of selling the Scriptures in the interior as well as in the open ports, irrespective of the protests of the Buddhists against the same.\*

The circulation of the Scriptures had largely increased. The sales of Bibles and "portions" by the three societies—the American Bible Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society, and the National Society of Scotland—amounted to 115,000 copies, for which 16,000 *yen* were received. It was the general rule of these societies to sell and not give away the Scriptures, the retail price being but little, if any, below the actual cost of production. Most of the missions and other societies that published Christian books put the price at such a sum as covered all the expenses of publication and distribution.

About this time Rev. Mr. Okuno, at the request of the superintendent of a large prison near Tokyo, commenced to preach every week to the criminals. His audiences usually numbered from eight hundred to a thousand. These services were kept up for about two years, when the opposition of Buddhist priests caused their discontinuance.

The missionary correspondence of 1881 and succeeding years contained accounts of the mass meetings that were frequently held in theatres. The ordinary theatre of Japan is a large, barn-like structure, open to the roof, the wood-work unpainted, and without ornamentation except that of the furnishings of the stage. The floor is divided by low railings into what resemble small cattle-pens. A family or a company of friends can engage one of these for its exclusive use. The spectators often bring their lunches with them or they can procure tea and refreshments from the neighbouring restaurants; and thus they combine the pleasures of a picnic with that of witnessing the play. There are usually one or two galleries. It was discovered that these buildings made good places for preaching. One of the first of these meetings of which a description is given was held in Kyoto. Rev. W. W. Curtis thus wrote of it:

"The hour for commencing was one p.m. We found the theatre, said to seat four thousand, comfortably filled with an expectant audience. There were probably in the neighbourhood of three thousand present. In the audience nearly every variety of fashion was illustrated, from that of the bare-legged coolie with nothing on but a loin-cloth and a loose open robe girded at the waist, to the becoming full dress of the *samurai,* and the less comely attire of foreign coat and pants. I could see but two or three men in all that assembly who wore the cue. One of the galleries was set apart for the ladies, scarcely any of whom were seen among the men below. In a box opposite the stage several officials were seated, who proved attentive listeners. It is estimated that as many as two hundred priests were in the audience. On the carpeted platform stood a little stand with a Bible and a glass of water on it. The name and subject of each speaker in large characters were posted up before he came upon the stage. Several minutes were given between the speeches to allow the audience to exchange a few words and take a smoke. To the right of the platform was the chairman with a call-bell on the table before him. with which he notified the speakers when their time was up. Near by was a cabinet organ, and seated around this some twenty or more students from our Training School. The audience applauded the speeches in the way which is now quite fashionable in Japan, by clapping their hands."

A Buddhist magazine published in Kyoto thus referred to this meeting:

"The place was crowded with hearers day and night, more than three thousand being present. The preachers were both converted Japanese and foreigners. The sermons were well prepared and able. Those on 'Faith' and 'Cause and Effect' were emotional and calculated to excite the uneducated. The preachers were eloquent. 'Love God and Your Neighbour' was very peculiar. As regards love, our Buddhists have something to be ashamed of. Among different kinds of love, that for your own party and friends is one of the greatest, and this leads to mutual help and so progress is rapid. It seems to me, however, that we are destitute of this love, and instead of it have internal dissensions. Is not this blameworthy?"\*

Though the meeting passed off without a display of opposition, Mr. Miyagawa, who was the chairman and one of the speakers, received an anonymous letter that denounced him as a very wicked man, a stirrer-up of strife, and threatened that he would not reach his home that night alive. In Japan at that time threats of assassination were not to be lightly regarded; but Mr. Miyagawa simply said: "I am ready, if need be, to be a martyr." No violence, however, was offered.

Similar meetings were held in other cities. In Osaka the Shinto and Buddhist priests were so annoyed that they brought legal action against the Governor for allowing such a meeting. The judges rendered the following decision:

"The plaintiffs in this action complain that the Governor has improperly administered the laws by permitting the Christians to hold a great meeting in Osaka. They allege that the Governor should have issued a notification forbidding foreigners to erect a church or preach a religion not sanctioned by Government, outside the limits of the Foreign Settlement, and also prohibiting all persons unauthorised by Government from preaching on religious subjects. The court is of opinion that the plaintiffs have no ground for their contention although there is nothing to prevent their presenting a petition to the Governor on this subject. . . . The case is therefore dismissed."†

The activity of the Christians led, in a few cases, to threats against the propagators of the new faith. Two theological students, who spent the summer vacation in Fukui, received from a Shintoist the following letter:

"You, in seeking the trifling gain that is offered you, preach the baneful doctrines of Christianity. What sin is greater? If you will repent, do it speedily, and we will be quiet; but if you continue preaching, we have weapons to destroy what is harmful to the country. The sacred sword to use for the holy Empire is at our side. Your impure blood, young children, is unworthy to be shed; but we will try the sword for the first time on your young necks.

"Village of Kawakita, God of Mountains: From Nobuakira, the Keeper of the Holy Empire.

"To the preachers of Barbarian Doctrines."

More legitimate methods of opposition were not neglected. The Buddhist priests published a series of tracts on "The Unreasonableness of Christianity." One of these urged that the existence of noxious beasts disproved the doctrine of a wise and loving Creator. Another adduced the Crusades to show that Christianity gives rise to wars. Mass meetings like those inaugurated by the Christians were held. Some of the speakers endeavoured to frighten the ignorant people by asserting that at the beginning of the next year the Government would put all Christians to death. Herod and Pilate became friends; the Buddhists seeking the help of those that were opposed to all religions. Three pupils of Mr. Fukuzawa, who like their master, the famous teacher and reformer, avowed that they did not believe in any religion, were employed to address meetings in Osaka and Kyoto. One of them began his speech by saying:

"I am neither a Buddhist nor Shinto priest; neither have I any special leaning to either of these religions, the excellence of which I am not well acquainted with; but I am aware of the iniquities of the Christian sect, and my purpose is, from love of country and sincere heart, to discuss these. Of late the progress made by this sect has been marvellous, and may be compared to a fire sweeping over a plain, which constantly increases in power. Wherever one may go, their preaching places are to be found. The three Christian sects, Catholic, Greek, and Protestant, which entered Japan simultaneously, have already produced much confusion, and bid fair to put an end to the old condition of things in my country. Therefore I propose, by the aid of ancient and modern history, to show whether Christianity is profitable or injurious, to startle these immoral believers of the foreign religion in their infatuated dreams, and call the attention of the Government and people to the subject. Now this Christian sect is very different from other religions and contains two greatly to be dreaded qualities. These are, first, cruelty and rebellion; second, the seizure and robbery of other countries. Therefore they are prone to present their complaints with sword and spear, murder innocent people, and seize their country and property; such instances are by no means rare."

The lecturer then went on to speak of the Crusades, of contests in Europe between Protestants and Roman Catholics, and of the troubles brought upon Japan by the preaching of Christianity three centuries before. He asserted that modern missionaries were sent by foreign governments for the sake of gaining a foothold in the country, and that their followers, in case of war between Japan and a Western nation, would secretly aid the latter. Lovers of their country should resist the progress of a religion that threatened such great evils.\*

The lecturers were so much nettled at the remarks of the newspapers accusing them of speaking only for the sake of the money paid them by the Buddhists, that in one of the subsequent meetings they made some violent attacks upon the priests, who were not a little vexed to have their allies thus turn against them.†

Mr. Fukuzawa himself delivered a lecture in Tokyo about the same time, in which he spoke of religion as being necessary for controlling the hearts of the people. For himself, he had no special leaning toward either Buddhism or Shintoism, but he feared the influence of Christianity would be to make people regard foreign nations with too much favour. He went on to say:

"At present there is great emulation and strife among nations to be first, and those that are careless will soon fall behind in the race. The right and the wrong are not much thought of any more. If a nation sees an opportunity to enrich herself by seizing another country, she does so without any misgiving. Christianity is making progress, but when Japanese become Christians, they will. . . consider everything Christian and that comes from Christian nations as very good, and will be disposed to take the side of foreign nations. Though Buddhism came from another land, yet it has for more than a thousand years held sway over the Japanese mind and is in fact a Japanese religion. If there were no religions in Japan at this time, then I might choose Christianity rather than Buddhism. But as Buddhism has for so long a time penetrated the life of the Japanese people, I am disposed to give all my assistance towards preventing Christianity from trespassing on the dominions of the former."\*

In a volume of essays Mr. Fukuzawa went even farther in his opposition to Christianity. He declared that there was danger that men of ability, who embraced the faith, might ultimately form a party that would come into opposition with a party or parties holding Japanese doctrines. Eventually an appeal might be made to arms, and this would lead the Christians to invoke foreign assistance, through which Japan would be in danger of losing its independence. The "liberty of conscience" that had come into fashion was working evil. Buddhism ought to be recognised as the one and only religion of Japan. The followers of Shinto, which is not properly a religion, should unite with the Buddhists to endeavour to oppose the spread of Christianity. The authorities ought also to take steps towards the same end. They might feel some delicacy about interfering in such matters, but they should not be misled by the vague notions of the students of Western doctrines to value liberty of conscience above their public duties and so to refrain from measures which concern them no less than taxation or the conduct of justice.†

Such sentiments seem very strange as coming from one who had done more than almost any other man to introduce Western ideas among the people. Caring little for religion itself, Mr. Fukuzawa in questions connected with it seems to have been almost as much a follower as a leader of public opinion; and it was not long, as we shall see, before he spoke in quite a different tone.

In Tokyo the Buddhists began holding a series of "lecture-meetings" in the Meiji Kwaido, a hall that was erected partly for political assemblies, but also with the avowed intention of furnishing a place where efforts might be made to oppose the spread of Christianity.

Some leaders of public thought, while professing indifference to religion itself, contended that all should be treated alike by the Government. The editor of a prominent paper in Tokyo, while declaring that he was opposed to Christianity, called on the Government to abandon its non-committal attitude and openly tolerate that religion. His reasons were: 1. Because it is a shame for the Government to retain laws against Christianity that are notoriously violated in all parts of the country. 2. Because religion ought to be free to each man to believe or reject as he pleases. 3. Because, while Christianity is bad, Buddhism is no better, and both ought either to be prohibited or to be tolerated.\*

The next year \(1882\) religious discussion waxed hotter and hotter. The Christians pushed into various parts of the country, and nearly everywhere they were able to gather large audiences. To counteract the influence of these meetings, the Buddhists started others in opposition, often hiring a house close to the one engaged by the Christians and thus trying to draw people away from the latter.

The *Jiji Shimpo,* a daily newspaper, was started in 1882 by Mr. Fukuzawa. At first, nearly every number contained an attack on Christianity. Though professing no attachment to Buddhism as a religion, it declared its preservation necessary for the national welfare,† The following extracts from an editorial will show its position:

"The national religion of Japan is Buddhist. We must protect it from decay. The higher classes in Japan care nothing about any religion. . . . This total indifference to religious things in the Japanese mind is greatly to be praised. Foreigners cannot equal us in this respect. Nevertheless, at the present juncture this peculiar merit of the Japanese is a grave detriment to the country. That Christianity is baneful to our national power is evident. . . . But educated people care nothing about it and relegate the whole thing to the priests. This is a dangerous tendency of the time. Unless assisted by the influence of the upper classes, nothing can obstruct the intrusion of Christianity. Moreover, Buddhist priests are immoral and shameless, and without energy of spirit. It is very unsafe to trust this weighty cause to them alone. We do not believe in Buddhism, nor do we respect the priest. Our concern is for the national power, in the conservation of which that religion must be utilised,"

This was doubtless written by Mr. Fukuzawa, who in another article said:

"We do not care to discuss the truth or falsity of religious systems; but looking at the matter from a statesman's point of view, we hold that in self-defence the foreign religion should be banished these shores. For this we should not rely so much on government aid or on the influence of scholars. The best method for counteracting the foreign religion is to encourage the native, that is, Buddhism; but the corrupt state of the priesthood is deplorable. . . . The priest preaches one day in the temple, and the next he is found in the meeting of the commercial company. He becomes a bankrupt. He squeezes a profit as broker in making loans. He leans here and flatters there. He is not ashamed to offer bribes. His only aim is to make money. He drowns himself in strong drink. He indulges his lust shamefully in the house of the harlot. We see him nowadays in layman's dress,—perhaps to cover his abominable conduct under the sleeves of his garment."\*

Mr. Fukuzawa's attitude was that of many men of his class, and he had considerable to do with shaping public Opinion. His paper soon attained great influence, while his school sent forth many talented young men who had imbibed the spirit of their master and who delighted to spread abroad what they had heard from him. It was his pupils who, at this time, translated and published the lectures of Colonel Robert Ingersoll, the American lecturer against Christianity.

Occasionally Christian meetings encountered such opposition as is described by Rev. P. K. Fyson of the Church Missionary Society, who, in writing of a chapel in Niigata, says:

"Almost every evening, except when the weather was very had, I used to go with the catechist to preach there. The number of hearers varied very much; there were frequently fifty or sixty, sometimes eighty and up to one hundred. Sometimes a very noisy set of young men came in and did their best to interrupt the meeting, to the evident annoyance of more sober-minded people who wished to hear what we had to say. The front of the house being open to the street, it was practically equivalent to preaching in the open air, and the people stood in their clogs on the earth floor, so that we could not turn the rowdy ones out, and their yells often completely drowned our voices. *'Makoto no Kami*' \('True God'\) would be shouted in derision, or *'Namu Amida Butsu*'—the usual Buddhist invocation—jocularly, in opposition. Abusive threats were hurled at us in abundance; 'Sorcerer,' 'Thief,' 'Incendiary,' 'Murderer,' and others too foul to repeat; the catechist coming in for his special share, 'Traitor to your country,' &c. Sometimes dirt and a few stones were thrown, or we found our table or the rain-doors smashed."\*

The funerals of believers often proved favourable opportunities, not only for addressing persons that otherwise might never attend Christian services, but also as a means of disproving the assertion often made that Christians treated the bodies of the dead with disrespect, a son not caring though the dogs might devour the corpse of his father. In some way the idea became widespread that at Christian funerals the chief ceremony was the driving of an iron spike into the skull of the dead body, and a morbid curiosity often drew large numbers to see this gruesome rite performed. In Okayama, the first death among the believers was that of a poor paralytic, who lived in a small and wretched house. Most of the Christians in that city belonged to well-to-do families; and it was a great surprise to the people that watched the procession as it passed through the streets, when they saw that the coffin, instead of being carried by coolies, was borne on the shoulders of the young men of the church, and that the poor paralytic was followed to the grave by so many well-known people. The Japanese think much of having "a splendid funeral," and a religion that would do so much for the poorest of its followers evidently did not deserve the charge of treating the bodies of the dead with disrespect.

Joseph Cook, the well-known Boston lecturer, visited Japan in 1882, and through interpreters addressed many large audiences. He was the first of the noted Christian speakers from abroad that have gone to Japan for such purposes, and his vigorous words attracted much attention. He was invited to speak in Kyoto by some prominent members of the Prefectural Assembly. Hiring a building that held over a thousand people, they assumed all the expenses connected with the lecture. Letters of invitation to be present were sent to leading citizens. The Vice-Governor, many members of the Prefectural Assembly, officials of the city, Buddhist priests, physicians, lawyers and others listened attentively to an address that, with its interpretation, occupied three hours and three-quarters.

While in Japan, Mr. Cook addressed to missionaries and to Japanese workers a number of questions. The replies given by the latter to some of the enquiries will serve to show their view of the situation. The first question was: "What are the chief objections made by educated natives of Japan to the acceptance of Christianity?" To this, four persons in Tokyo united in replying:

"\(a\) The supernatural element in Christianity; e.g., miracles and divinity of Christ.

"\(b\) The opposition of Christianity against ancestral worship, especially among those who have received Chinese education.

"\(c\) The doctrine of future existence, which they consider as a pious fraud.

"\(d\) Its supposed disadvantage to the growth of national spirit and to the independence of the country.

"\(e\) Alleged conflicts between Christianity and modern science.

"\(f\) Supposed hindrances of Christianity to the progress of civilisation."

Ten pastors and teachers in Kyoto replied to the same question::

"They think that Christianity will destroy patriotism, filial duty, loyalty to the Mikado; give rise to religious wars, become the secret means of foreign interference. They regard the supernatural elements in Christianity as an outgrowth of superstitions and to he antagonistic to modern sciences. They confound Protestantism with Roman and Greek Catholicism."

The question. "What are the chief hindrances to its acceptance by the uneducated among the Japanese?" received from Tokyo the reply:

"\(a\) The fear of offending the Government and their friends.

"\(b\) The observance of Sabbath.

"\(c\) Ancestral worship.

"\(d\) Simplicity of Christian worship.

"\(e\) Dislike of change.

"\(f\) Strictness of Christian morals. "\(g\) Sacrifices and obstacles inherent to Christian profession."

The Kyoto workers answered:

"They regard Christianity as a foreign religion. They fear the Government persecutions on account of the attitude of the Government toward the Roman Catholics in the past. They regard Christianity as a demon's religion. They regard the Sabbath and other Christian discipline as too severe and impracticable."

The most specific answer to the enquiry, "What books opposed to evangelical Christianity and a theistic philosophy are the most read by the educated Japanese?" was the following from Tokyo:

"Buckle's 'History of Civilisation' \(translated\), John S. Mill's works \(his 'Essays on Religion and Utilitarianism,' translated\), Huxley on 'Protoplasm' \(translated\), Draper's 'Conflict between Science and Religion' and 'The Intellectual Development in Europe,' Thomas Paine's 'Age of Reason' \(translated\), Ingersoll's 'Lectures on Gods' \(translated\), Herbert Spencer's works, Bain's works."

The question, "By what aspects of Christian truth are the most conversions made?" was answered from Tokyo:

"\(a\) The great comfort which Christianity gives to the afflicted.

"\(b\) Excellency of Christian morals."

The answer to the same question from Kyoto was;

"\(a\) The excellence of the Christian ethics.

"\(b\) The reasonableness of Christian system.

"\(c\) The doctrine of the New Birth.

"\(d\) The doctrine of the Atonement.

"\(e\) The doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul."\*

\* There are many Europeans and Americans who do their best to make the Japanese think that Christianity has been outgrown by Western nations. An enthusiastic eulogy of the well-known writer, Lafcadio Hearn, that appeared in *The Sun Trade Journal* \(Tokyo\) of June 1, 1905, says that when he was teaching English in Kumamoto \(about 1890\), one of his pupils referred in an essay to the civilisation of Christendom, Mr. Hearn, in a written criticism of the paragraph, said: "It is very doubtful whether the civilisation of a people has any connection whatever with their religion. In Christian countries, moreover, the most learned men do not believe in Christianity, and the Christian religion is divided into countless sects which detest each other. No European scientist of note—no philosopher of high rank—no really great man is a Christian in belief." If in after years this pupil read Mr. Hearn's "Japan, an Interpretation," he must have been surprised to find that its opening chapter was chiefly devoted to the thought that the social conditions, industrial history, art, literature, etc. of a country cannot be understood without a knowledge of its religion. The article goes on to say that Mr, Hearn's hatred of Christianity was so great that when in his walks he came upon a church, he would not pass before it, but would turn about and go another way. Such conduct and words on the part of a popular teacher could not fail to prejudice his pupils strongly against Christianity.

### RAPID GROWTH   1883-1888





WE have now reached the time when the growth of the Protestant churches and the eagerness of the people to learn about Christianity were such as to arouse the highest hopes of the missionaries, and to excite the wonder of the whole Christian world. Many persons were led to ask the old question with a tone that implied an affirmative answer: "Shall a nation be born in a day?"

Though there is no one point that specifically marks the beginning of this period of rapid growth, the year 1883 has usually been considered as opening a new chapter in the history of the Protestant churches. This is partly because it was the year when important conventions were held, and partly because it saw the beginning of a series of revivals that exerted a powerful influence upon the Christians, and through them upon unbelievers.

The first of the meetings was the Second Conference of the Protestant Missionaries of Japan\* It was held in the Municipal Hall of the Foreign Concession in Osaka, from Monday, April 16, to Saturday, April 21, 1883. One hundred and six missionaries \(fifty-eight men and forty-eight women\) were in attendance; representing sixteen missionary societies, four Bible societies, and two societies working for seamen.

The first morning Rev. J. H. Ballagh of the Reformed Church Mission, preached a sermon on "The Need and Promise of the Power of the Holy Spirit in Our Work as Missionaries," the text being Acts i, 8. "By the thought pervading this sermon," wrote Dr. G. W. Knox, "the conference was borne along; it showed itself at every devotional meeting and found expression again and again in the various addresses."

The Conference was organised with three Chairmen:— J. C. Hepburn, M.D., LL.D., of the American Presbyterian Mission; Rev. R. S. Maclay, D.D., of the Methodist Episcopal Mission; and Rev. C. F. Warren of the Church Missionary Society. The first of these, in replying to an address of welcome, referred to the fact that twenty-four years ago that month he and his wife had started from New York on their way to Japan, They knew not whether they would be allowed to land; and when, in October, their ship entered the Bay of Yedo, they knelt down to pray that in some way a home might be provided for them, and that they might be guided in the work they were about to undertake. He did not then know whether he should ever see one Japanese brought to Christ; he little thought that he would ever be privileged to preside over such a meeting as was now being held.

The first paper presented to the Conference was a "History of Protestant Missions in Japan," by Rev. G. F. Verbeck; a paper that has been the authority for many of the statements contained in the present work. Other papers dealt with the different forms of missionary activity, the obstacles to the reception of Christianity by the Japanese, and other allied themes. One day was given to the consideration of "Self-support of the Native Churches," the most radical views being those contained in a paper by Rev. H. H. Leavitt of the American Board Mission, who contended that no aid from mission funds should be given to churches, evangelists, or schools. In the evening the subject was further considered at a united Conference of Japanese and Foreign Workers. Rev. Paul Sawayama, who had been closely associated with Mr. Leavitt, and whose own church had been conducted on the principles he advocated, read a paper in which he took the ground that the Japanese Church should "provide money sufficient to cover the whole expense of the evangelistic, pastoral, and educational work of the Church, without receiving any pecuniary assistance whatever from foreign missionary societies," the latter providing only for the support of the missionaries. A paper by Rev. Paul Kanamori advocated that, while the church expenses and the support of native evangelists should be provided by the Japanese, foreign help should be given for schools and for the production of Christian literature. Other Japanese that joined in the discussion were not ready to take so radical positions as these speakers.

The evident spirit of unity among the missionaries present at this Conference made a great impression on the Japanese that attended the meetings or heard of them through the reports in the Christian papers. The missionaries had come together full of courage and hope. The remarkable success attending past labours led to a strong belief that, under God's blessing, Japan would in a few years be a Christian nation. Some went so far as to say that, if the call sent out by the Conference asking for re-enforcements was heeded by the churches at home, the work of evangelising Japan could be accomplished within ten years, or at least before the close of the century. Lastly, there was a deep devotional spirit. Some had come with hearts warmed by revival scenes among foreigners and Japanese at Yokohama and Tokyo. The Conference had for weeks been made the subject of much prayer. During the sessions, several Japanese churches in different parts of the land held special meetings to ask God's blessing on all that was done. The devotional meetings held in connection with the Conference itself, were pervaded with an earnest desire that those present might receive power from on high to fit them for the work to which they had been called.

Among the acts of the Conference was the preparation of a letter addressed to the Convention of the Japanese Churches, which was to meet the next month in Tokyo. It told of the unity of spirit and harmony of opinion that had prevailed among the missionaries in their meeting, expressed sympathy with the Japanese workers, and prayed that a blessing might rest upon them during their deliberations, and in all their work.

The Convention of the Japanese churches had been preceded by events that prepared the way for making it a meeting full of power and enthusiasm. A deep religious interest that began among the foreign sailors in Yokohama had spread to the churches of that city and Tokyo. During the Week of Prayer at the beginning of the year, great earnestness in seeking a blessing from God and in carrying the Gospel to non-believers, had been manifested among the churches. Dr. Maclay of the American Methodist Episcopal Mission, wrote early in the spring:

"A spirit of religious revival, bringing times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord, is spreading in Japan, both among the foreign community and among Japanese Christians. I have not before seen anything like it since coming to Japan, and trust we are about to witness signal displays of divine mercy in the conversion of souls."

Just before the meeting of the Convention, Rev. H. Kozaki, the pastor of a Kumi-ai\* church in Tokyo, wrote:

"Thank God\! He is doing a mighty work among us. The Day of Pentecost is now being realised here. Many churches about Tokyo are just now undergoing the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Our church and the Methodist church are especially blessed. We are holding prayer-meetings every evening this week through. Every evening many were blessed with the Spirit, and many new ones confessed their faith in Christ, while all were undergoing the most extraordinary experience. I now realise the prophecy of the prophet Joel: 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out My Spirit,' etc. The last night I could not sleep till one o'clock because of the anxious enquirers after the truth; this morning about half-past five, they came again to see me."

In Osaka a few Christians began to meet daily, to pray for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Their earnestness extended to others, so that the churches of different denominations soon united in daily prayer-meetings. "There was no excitement, but intense fervour and definiteness, both in prayer and exhortation."

The Osaka Conference of Missionaries exerted a helpful influence upon the Convention in Tokyo. Japanese Christians in attendance at the former gathering had been impressed by its spirit of harmony and earnestness. They were thus the better prepared to promote a similar spirit in their own meeting. Those of them that were connected with the Kumi-ai churches were further helped by a meeting of their Missionary Society held in Kyoto the last of April.

Perhaps the Tokyo Convention will be best described by extracts from a letter sent by Mr. Neesima to the missionaries of the American Board who were at the same time holding their annual meeting in Kyoto. He wrote May 11:

"I am anxious to write you a few lines telling how the Lord blessed us in our great fellowship meeting. We commenced it on Tuesday with a one-hour prayer-meeting. It was the most impressive service I ever attended in my life. A spirit of union was greatly manifested in that meeting. In the afternoon we had reports from the delegates. It was a most enjoyable part of the conference. I can assure you that the Lord blessed us far more than we asked for. On Wednesday we bad a prayer-meeting from eight to nine a. m. ; public meeting for speaking in the afternoon. About seven hundred were present. Thursday's programme was just the same. I preached this morning at the communion service. There was an hour of prayer-meeting before the communion. Mr. Okuno served at the communion table. It was the richest part of the meeting. All the people burst into tears. For this afternoon, topics on personal faith, education of preachers, and self-support were brought out for discussion, but I found myself so exhausted I did not attend. There is perfect union between the native brethren and the missionaries, and these two united parties are happily united in the Lord.

"May 12. I will add a few more lines to my yesterday's note to you. I attended the union prayer-meeting last night. The house was completely filled for the largest prayer-meeting I ever attended in Japan. It commenced promptly at eight p. m., and closed at ten p. m.No vain and useless words were uttered either in remarks or prayers. Three or four persons stood up at once, and the leader of the meeting was obliged to ask others to wait until one finished. At the same time they seemed calm and serious. There was no undue excitement. The spirit of union was wonderfully manifested then. Numbers of our native brethren confessed that they have been very ungrateful toward the missionaries, and begged their pardon for it. A few missionary brethren made very impressive remarks, and seemed so glad and happy."

The delegates in Tokyo hastened to inform their churches by letter or telegram of the blessings that were being received. Though most of the pastors and evangelists were in attendance on the Convention, the Christians, whom they had left behind, continued with new earnestness the daily prayer-meetings that had been already inaugurated, or began them where they had not previously been held. Hitherto the acceptance of Christianity had, with many, been only an intellectual acknowledment of its truth; but now there came to them a real sense of personal sin, an acceptance of Christ as a personal Saviour, and an earnest desire for the spiritual welfare of others.

Soon the delegates returned to their churches. "They were like new men. They had evidently received fresh light, grace, and power from on high," Ere long the letters of the missionaries began to he filled with joyful accounts of the revival. Rev. C. F. Warren, of the Church Missionary Society, wrote from Osaka:

"During the whole of my ministerial experience of nearly twenty years, whether in China, England, or Japan, I never before witnessed such tokens of the presence and power of the Spirit of God. It was a blessed time of refreshing, and, thank God, the results have not been transient."

Rev. C. S. Long, of the Methodist Episcopal Mission, reported:

"The Lord is doing a glorious work in Nagasaki. The Holy Spirit is being poured out upon the missionaries and natives in marvellous showers. Scores are being genuinely converted, testifying to the truth and power of the new religion. Persons who have been members of the Church for years are being born into the kingdom of grace and glory, and for the first time are realising the joy of sins forgiven and adoption into the spiritual kingdom of Christ. The Lord is certainly doing a wonderful work among us. The news is spreading through the city, and hundreds are flocking to the church. The members of other churches are becoming interested, and there is every indication that the glorious work will spread in every direction, and that hundreds will be brought to a knowledge of the true God. It is marvellous indeed. I never saw anything more striking at home."\*

In August Rev, M. L. Gordon, of the American Board Mission, wrote from Kyoto:

"The sense of sin, and the need of the Holy Spirit, and His actual working also, have been experienced as never before and to an extent which mere words, even the words of Scripture, could not effect, but which, when effected by the Spirit, most naturally find expression in the words of Scripture. A great many touching incidents have occurred. I heard one of our most devoted and self-denying pastors. . . tell how one night after they had retired, a brother sprang on him the question: 'If ambition were subtracted from your heart, what would the remainder be?' 'It pierced,' he said, 'like an arrow; for my heart told me that the true reply would be *zero\!* He told, in the same address, how reading the life of Luther had done him great harm by filling his mind with thoughts of doing great and astonishing work rather than attending to the humble and faithful performance of the work God gave him to do.

"Mr. Neesima went to the great meeting in Tokyo prepared to advocate very strongly the necessity of union and harmony, first among the Japanese Christians themselves, and also between them and the missionaries; but he found no need of the speech he had prepared, for the whole assembly were already enthusiastically committed to the idea of union."†

In nearly all places where Christian work had been established the churches were crowded with eager listeners. Requests were constantly coming to the missionaries, urging them to visit cities where people desired instruction. There were large accessions to the membership of the churches. The pastors and the missionaries were filled with the highest hopes. An editorial in the *Independent* \(New York\) of September 6, 1883, fairly represents the feelings of those that were interested in the evangelisation of Japan. It says:

"It is not an extravagant anticipation that Japan may become a Christian nation in seventeen years. The Christian missionaries in Japan are now working with a strong hope that the twentieth century will open upon that island empire no longer a foreign mission field, but predominantly Christian, converted from shadowy paganisms and vague philosophies which now retain but a feeble hold upon the people, and received into the brotherhood of Christendom. A Japanese Constantine is not far off."

The year 1884 saw the movement in favour of Christianity extending and deepening. It was about this time that the word *rebaiburu* \(revival\) gained a place in the vocabulary of the Christians; and there was constant occasion for its use in connection with the spiritual awakenings that took place in the churches and Christian schools. One of the most marked of these was in the Doshisha. About the first of March, several of the Christian students began a daily meeting, which was held at half-past nine in the evening at the close of study-hours, The numbers in attendance and the interest constantly increased until, on Sunday, March 16, the whole school showed that it was greatly moved. The different classes held meetings in which for hours they engaged in prayer, confession of sins, and praise. Through the following week the young men could think of hardly anything else than their relations to God. But few in the school remained unmoved. The students were eager to go out and tell others of the blessings they had deceived. It was with difficulty that they were induced to be satisfied with choosing three representatives who should carry the report to the churches, while the others should wait until the approaching vacation. To those that know the excitable nature of the young men of Japan, it will not seem strange that there were some extravagances. The teachers, and especially the missionaries, endeavoured to guard against excesses; urging "as strongly as they knew how, that the regularity of school life be maintained as regards studies, meals, exercise, and sleep; that the prayer-meetings be held early in the evening and be rigidly restricted to one hour; and that special pains be taken to secure quiet during the evening."

Among the churches there were many revivals. We read of prayer-meetings "full of tears, sobbings, and broken confessions of sins." In theatres and other buildings large audiences listened quietly and earnestly to the preaching of the Gospel. In Tokyo, where formerly such meetings had been subject to disturbance, four thousand people assembled in one of the theatres and showed no signs of opposition.

The rapid growth of the churches at this time is exemplified by that of the Kumi-ai body. In the year ending March 31, 1884, the total membership increased sixty-eight per cent.; and in the next year, fifty-three per cent.

It will be remembered that so late as 1881 Mr. Fukuzawa Yukichi had published essays in which he opposed Christianity as dangerous to the nation, and had even gone so far as to urge that the Government take measures to prevent its extension. It seems very strange to find this leader of public opinion publishing only three years later an essay entitled "The Adoption of the Foreign Religion is Necessary." After speaking of the way in which some animals protect themselves from danger by taking on the colour of their surroundings, he said;

"It is an undeniable fact that the civilised countries of Europe and America excel all other lands not only in political institutions, but also in religion, in customs, and manners. It is natural therefore that they should be inclined to despise nations that differ from them in these particulars, as that other nations should appreciate their superiority and strive to imitate their example. Thus these features of a superior civilisation in Europe and America constitute a certain social distinctive colour world-wide in its character. Any nation therefore which lacks this distinctive badge of Western civilisation stands in the position of an opponent, and is not only unable to cope with the superiority of enlightened Americans and Europeans, but is directly or indirectly exposed to their derision. Hence one of the disadvantages under which inferior nations labour when they present a different colour from that of Western nations. The adoption of Western religion, along with institutions and customs, is the only means by which the social colour can become so assimilated as to remove this bar to intercourse and this cause of opposition....

"The civilised nations of Europe and America have always held that non-Christian countries could not be treated as enlightened nations. Such being the case, if we desire to maintain our intercourse with Western nations on the basis of international law, it is first of all absolutely necessary that we remove completely the stigma from our land of being an anti-Christian country, and obtain the recognition of fellowship by the adoption of their social color.

"Our suggestion may seem to imply a base currency and a subordination of our country to the sway of foreign powers, but such is by no means the case. According to the natural principle of all mundane intercourse, the inferior party can never hope to exercise a superior influence over the stronger. . . . To yield to enlightenment and to adopt civilised manners would not by any means indicate the policy of a sycophant, but simply a policy of self-defence by adopting the protective color of civilisation among civilised nations.

"Looked at from this point, it would appear that we ought to adopt a religion which, prevailing in Europe and America, exerts so considerable an influence over human affairs and social intercourse, so that our country may become a part of Christendom, presenting the same social appearance as Western powers, and sharing with them the advantages and disadvantages of their civilisation. We believe that the diplomatic adjustment of international intercourse with the outer world can be effected only by pursuing the course here suggested.

"As before stated, if we are not mistaken in our arguments, there is no alternative for our own country but to adopt the social colour of civilised nations in order to maintain our independence on a footing of equality with the various powers of the West. As an absolutely necessary preliminary, however, the Christian religion must be introduced from Europe and America, where it is propagated with the utmost enthusiasm. The adoption of this religion will not fail to bring the feelings of our people and the institutions of our land into harmony with those of the lands of the Occident. We earnestly desire, therefore, for the sake of our national administration that steps be taken for the introduction of Christianity as the religion of Japan.

"It must, however, be borne in mind that, although we have frequently adverted to religious subjects, we have refrained from expressing an opinion as to the nature of any—*i.e.,* as to their truth or falsity. From the standpoint of a private individual, we may say that we take little or no interest in the subject of religion, as it does not affect our personal feelings or sentiments."\*

In a later article Mr. Fukuzawa said that in order to have Japan put on an equal footing with other nations.

"We must change our professed belief and wear a religious dress uniform with others. We mean by professed belief, what we profess to believe apart from the question of what may be our true doctrine. It would be sufficient to make it publicly known that Japan is a Christian country. . . . We do not mean that the majority of our countrymen should be Christians. A small number, one for every hundred, wilt he sufficient. All that is required is the assumption of the title of a Christian country. The steps necessary for the Christianisation of the country are to register the creed of Japanese Christians, permit the conduct of funeral ceremonies by missionaries, and gradually introduce baptism among the upper and middle classes. We cannot attach too much importance to Japan's entrance into the comity of Christian nations."†

Astonishing as it may seem to the reader that a man in Mr. Fukuzawa's position should be willing to advocate such hypocrisy, he was followed by others that spoke and wrote in favour of the same policy. It is said that some of them went so far as to urge that the Emperor receive baptism so that Japan might at once be counted as a Christian country. Among the politicians that were agitating in favour of a constitutional government were some that hoped to make Christianity a tool for accomplishing their purpose. Many other influential persons recognised the moral power of Christianity and, though not willing themselves to yield to its restraints, they sent their children to Christian schools and contributed to the support of Christian institutions.

The leader of the Liberal Party, which was agitating for popular government, was Mr, \(afterwards Count\) Itagaki. Early in 1884 he visited Imabari, Shikoku, in order to give a political lecture. This town was the seat of one of the most flourishing churches in Japan; and some of his party residing there had said that their leader would give the foreign religion its deathblow. Great was their surprise when Mr. Itagaki invited the pastor of the church to deliver an address upon the Christian view of politics. Not only did Mr. Itagaki applaud the sentiments that were expressed, but in his own speech he said that Christianity was one of the needs of the hour, for Japan could not hope to rank with Western nations until it possessed their religion. Soon after this, Mr. Itagaki invited the missionaries of the Reformed and Presbyterian Churches to visit Kochi, the city in which he lived. He asked the leading merchants, bankers, and politicians to meet them, was himself present at the public gatherings, and delivered an address in which he advocated the adoption of Christianity. There had before this been some interest in Christianity aroused by visits of Rev. J. L. Atkinson, and it was now greatly increased. Mr. Itagaki did all he could to aid the movement from outside, but did not profess to become himself a follower of Christ. Others, however, and among them some who afterwards held prominent places in political circles, became believers. A few months later, a church was formed that was self-supporting from the first, Mr. Itagaki presenting it with a building, and promising to pay one-half of the pastor's salary.

The *Japan Mail* \(July 12, 1884\), speaking of the great change in public opinion, said that the best minds in Japan were beginning to appreciate what the Christian work of previous years had accomplished.

"The quiet work of these years, in school and chapel, by means of tens of thousands of books and tracts assiduously circulated, together with the influence of pure personal and family life, has prepared the way for such a movement as the present. The Christian Church in Japan, small though it be, is making a good record for itself—so good, indeed, that rascals make it profitable to counterfeit the true—while the indirect results of the new faith are traceable far beyond the reach of nominal believers."

As might be supposed, the missionaries were much encouraged at the outlook. Many of them felt that the time had come for broader plans and more vigorous efforts. An address by Rev. C. S. Eby of the Canadian Methodist Mission, entitled "The Immediate Christianisation of Japan: Prospects, Plans, Results," excited much interest in those who heard it, and in others who read it as afterwards printed. The special plans it urged included the establishment of "a national Christian University, which shall not only offer better advantages than the Imperial University of Tokyo, but vie with the best universities in our home lands," for which two million dollars should be asked from Christian philanthropists of the West; a "central Apologetical Institute or Lectureship of Christian Philosophy, which should be housed in an imposing building of solid construction containing a hall capable of seating from one thousand to five thousand people, and a library of choice apologetic and other literature;" the increase of the "missionary force by one hundred or more evangelists who shall have nothing to do but to preach;" and the uniting of churches having nearly the same polity and belief, so that there should be but five denominations, all "working in harmony to gather in the fruits and build for all time."

The Tokyo and Yokohama Missionary Conference, before which this paper was read, gave it an enthusiastic approval and drew up an elaborate plan for carrying out its recommendations. Doubtless the difficulties involved in such a programme were more or less evident to all; but none felt like opposing what was in itself desirable, however Utopian the plan might appear. It is needless to say that men and means were never supplied. The paper cannot be said, however, to have been without any good results. It did something to aid the slowly developing movement for union among closely related churches; and the establishment in Tokyo, at a later date, of the Central Tabernacle by Mr. Eby's own mission, was a partial carrying out of his plan for an Apologetical Institute.

The educational work carried on by the different missions kept pace with the rapid advance in other directions. Already in 1883 the Methodist Episcopal Mis-sion had established in Tokyo the Aoyama Gakuin, comprising a theological school, a college, and an academy for boys; as also a seminary for girls. In 1884 the Canadian Methodists opened the Toyo Eiwa Gakko in Tokyo; the Evangelical Association, a seminary in the same city; the Church Missionary Society, a school for boys and also a divinity school, both in Osaka; the Baptists, a theological seminary in Yokohama; and the American Board, a school for Bible-women in Kobe. The same year the Scripture Union was established, its object being to encourage the reading of the Bible. A programme of daily readings was prepared for its members, many of whom were not members of churches, but promised to read the passages selected. The society soon gained members in all parts of the Empire.

In August, 1884, the Government issued a notification to the effect that "the Shinto and Buddhist Official Priesthood has been abolished, and the power of appointing and discharging incumbents of religious temples and monasteries, and the promotion and degradation in rank of preceptors, has been transferred to the religious superintendents of those sects;" under certain regulations that were of such a nature as to relieve the Government from all responsibility for the conduct of religious affairs. Thus the connection of these religions with the State was almost completely severed. One practical result of the new regulations accompanying this notification was that permission was given the people to bury their dead under such forms as they preferred, This greatly lessened the power of the Buddhist priests to annoy the Christians, though they were still able to prevent burials in cemeteries that belonged to the temples.

Notwithstanding the evident intention of the Government to favour religious liberty, priests and local officials often attempted to put obstacles in the way of Christianity. One of the under officials in a town near Kobe was forbidden by his superior to attend Christian services, to have family worship, or even to read the Bible. He accordingly resigned his office, but was soon after appointed to a higher position. In another place, when a Christian was chosen upon the school-hoard, the mayor united with others in holding back the returns and refusing to let him serve. They also endeavoured to get a Christian teacher to feign sickness or plead some other excuse for handing in his resignation. He refused to oblige them, and they could bring no complaint against him except his religion.

In several places chapels were stoned, windows broken, and occasionally personal injury inflicted. In one town the stones were so large and numerous that the Christians preserved them and used them a few years later as part of the foundation of a church building. In other places such missiles were inscribed: "Persecution Stones," and kept as mementoes. In Takahashi, Bitchiu, where drums were beaten and other methods taken to disturb Christian meetings, an amusing incident occurred. Some young men had managed to catch a large number of black snakes. These they carried in a basket one evening to the Christian chapel with the intention of throwing them into the midst of the worshippers. There was a crowd of people before the open front of the house, trying in its own way to cause annoyance, and the young men attempted to throw the basket over the heads of these people into the house. As it left their hands, it accidentally caught in such a way as to turn it upside down, dropping its contents on the heads of the outsiders, and it was they instead of the Christians who were startled and put to flight by the uncanny reptiles.

It was commonly believed that the Buddhist priests in Kyoto had instigated attacks that were made upon the Christians. The Governor of the prefecture, therefore, called together the heads of the different sects that he might remonstrate with them. After reminding them that the Japanese Government was endeavouring to get foreign nations to consent to a revision of the treaties, he told them that, if success attended these efforts, foreigners would be permitted to reside in the interior, and must be left free to believe and to preach their religion. He then said: "We have recently heard that Buddhist believers sometimes interrupt the Protestant and Roman Catholic preachers, destroy their houses and property, and injure Christian converts. If such riotous actions be frequently indulged in, it is a thousand to one if the matter do not become a question with every foreign government. . . . Seek to influence the priests of your sects to instruct their followers and not suffer them to make mistakes and injure our country." It was probably because of this warning that the Chief Abbot of the Shin sect issued a letter calling on the priests to be submissive to notifications issued by the Government and not to use violence in their efforts to prevent people from becoming Christians.

The following letter was received by missionaries in Kyoto:

"To the Four American Barbarians; Davis, Gordon, Learned, and Greene; We speak to you who have come with words that are sweet in the mouth but a sword in the heart, bad priests, American barbarians, four robbers. You have come from a far country with the evil religion of Christ and as slaves of the Japanese robber Neesima. With bad teaching you are gradually deceiving the people; but we know your hearts, and hence we shall soon with Japanese swords inflict the punishment of heaven upon you. Japan being truly a flourishing, excellent country, in ancient times when Buddhism first came to Japan, those who brought it were killed; in the same way you must be killed. But we do not want to defile the sacred soil of Japan with your abominable blood; for this reason we wait two weeks and you must leave Kyoto and go to your country; if not, the little robbers of the Doshisha School, and all the believers of this way in the city, will be killed; hence, take your families and go quickly.

"Patriots in the Peaceful City; Believers in Shinto."

After a while the efforts of the Buddhists against Christianity took the form of what was known as *Yase Taiji,* or Movement for the Extermination of the Religion of Jesus. Priests and others visited different parts of the country delivering lectures, forming societies, and stirring up the people to resist the progress of Christianity. One of the leading arguments they advanced against it was that it required its followers to abstain from war, and, therefore, in case Japan should be attacked, they would do nothing for the defence of their country.

It is said that these agitators were officially warned that they must give up the use of the word *taiji.* However this may have been, there continued to be from time to time incidents that showed the Government to be in favour of toleration. Among these the *Japan Mail* called attention to what took place at the funeral of Mr. Davidow, the Russian Minister, in December, 1885. It says of the ceremony, which was conducted in accordance with the rites of the Greek Church:

"It was essentially official. Japanese princes were present in the chapel; Japanese Ministers of State in full uniform walked behind the bier; Japanese artillery fired minute guns; and the body of the deceased Minister was deposited in a mausoleum erected by the Japanese Government. But at the head of the cortège marched a body of Japanese Christians; Japanese priests took a prominent part in performing the funeral rites; and a choir of Japanese girls and boys sang the requiem for the dead."

In 1885 three new missions began work in Japan. They were those of the Presbyterian Church of the United States,\* of the American Society of Friends, and of the Evangelical Protestant Missionary Society \(German and Swiss\). As this last society is not well known by American and English Christians, and as its principles and methods differ in some respects from those of others working in Japan, a few words concerning it will not be out of place. The society was organised in 1884, being "the first attempt of Liberal Christianity to co-operate in mission work in accordance with its own convictions." One of its promoters expressed the principles of the society in the following theses:

"We must bring the Gospel to the civilised heathen nations:

"1. Not as human wisdom, but as a divine revelation;

"2. Not as the sole, but as a perfect revelation;

"3. Not as a new culture, but as a help in moral distress;

"4. Not as a party or denominational matter, but as a testimony of the one and only Saviour;

"5. Not as a collection of remarkable doctrines, but as an act of God for our salvation;

"6. Not as the history of something past, but as a power of God experienced by the Christian in his own heart."

Its representatives in Japan, as described by one of their number:

"Aim at a reconciliation of Christianity with the modern view of the world by striving after an up-to-date expression of the eternal truth of the simple Gospel of Jesus, adapted at the same time to the particular needs of the Japanese, instead of offering ancient but transient formulas of Western dogmatics and worship."

The first missionary of this society was Pastor Wilfred Spinner, D.D. Almost immediately after his arrival, he began to publish a monthly magazine, entitled *Shinri* \(Truth\), This was sent gratuitously to many of the leading preachers, among whom it soon exerted a strong influence. Dr. Spinner himself was invited to teach history in a school preparatory to the Imperial University. His scholarly attainments attracted many to the addresses on religious and philosophical subjects that he soon commenced to give. In 1887 the first church was organised, taking the name, Fukyu Fukuin Kyokwai, or General Evangelical Church. A theological school was opened the same year.

Bishop Poole, who had come in 1883, to supervise the work carried on by the missions of the Church of England, spent but ten months in the country before ill health made it necessary for him to return to England, There he died in 1885. The next year Bishop Edward Bickersteth succeeded to the office. He was the son of the Bishop of Exeter and, like his predecessor, had been a missionary in India.

Work among the Ainu, the aborigines living in Yezo, had been begun by Rev. J. Batchelor of the Church Missionary Society. It was attended by many difficulties. The language had to be studied without help from books. The Ainu were addicted to strong drink, and the Japanese that dwelt among them and often tyrannised over them tried to keep them from coming under the influence of the missionaries. In 1885 the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the hymn "Jesus Loves Me"—"the first things ever printed in the Ainu language"—were struck off by Mr. Batchelor on a small hand-press. At later dates he published translations of the Scriptures and the Prayer Book. He has also published in English, books upon the Ainu language, as well as descriptions of the people and their customs. On Christmas Day, 1885, the first Ainu was baptised. He was the son of a village chief. After this, a few baptisms occurred from time to time, until in 1893 there was an ingathering of one hundred and seventy-one persons. At the time of the Tokyo Conference in 1900, there were more than eleven hundred and fifty Ainu Christians. In addition to direct evangelistic work Mr. Batchelor and his associates opened schools and established in Sapporo a "Rest-house" to accommodate Ainu out-patients that come to receive treatment at the Japanese hospital in that city. A sad feature of the efforts made for the evangelisation of the Ainu is the knowledge that, as Mr. Batchelor says, "The race is a dying one, and nothing that can now be done can save it."

Several essays published in 1886 by Japanese writers are noteworthy for the favourable, though patronising, tone in which they speak of Christianity. Professor Toyama of the Imperial University, in an article on the education of girls, said that it would be a great advantage if they could be instructed by European or American ladies. The most feasible way of bringing this about would be by the aid of Christian missionaries, whom he advised to establish five or six large schools in Tokyo. To those missionaries who might object that they came to Japan for purposes of propagandism, not of education, he replied that the most effective way of extending their religion would be by educating girls of the higher classes; for conversion to a new faith, as history teaches, begins with women. Let them believe, and the faith of the children would certainly follow. There was no reason to fear that the people of the higher classes would be so averse to Christianity as not to send their daughters to these schools. The Japanese were not hostile to any particular religion, though contemptuous of all. If convinced that benefits came from any creed, they would not show antipathy to it. The present schools were not of sufficiently high grade, nor were they centrally located. There ought also to be classes for adult women where they could learn Western customs.

The great desire among the upper classes to adopt Western ways was, indeed, at its height. Officials were required to wear the European style of dress while on duty, and women were urged to exchange their robes for the dresses worn by their Western sisters. This movement was largely political, for those that promoted it said: "So long as we are attired in Oriental garb, we are treated as Orientals; if we wish to be regarded by Europeans as on an equality with themselves, we must put on their outward appearance." With the same end in view, balls and other Occidental forms of entertainment were introduced. It was under such circumstances that Professor Toyama issued a pamphlet on "The Relations between Social Reforms and Christianity." In it he advocated the adoption of Christianity for the following reasons:—1. Christianity assists in the improvement of music; 2. Its adoption will help to develop ability for combination and union, in which Japanese are very deficient; 3. Its influence will elevate the position of women, and bring the sexes together in a way that will benefit both. He closed by saying:

"The reformers of society must not be contented with such paltry measures as the inauguration of balls and garden parties. Those who, while enthusiastically admiring the customs and manners of the West, do not exert themselves to further the introduction of that religion which has the most intimate connection with those manners and customs, must lay themselves open to the charge of being either ignorant or cowardly,"

Somewhat later Professor Toyama published "A New Plea for the Advancement of Christianity." This manifested the same desire to make that religion a tool for advancing the causes in which he was interested. While still advocating the education of girls in Christian schools, he also urged the missionaries to establish preparatory schools to fit students for entrance to the Imperial University, since public opinion would become favourable to Christianity when the highest institution of learning was permeated with that religion.

A Japanese gentleman contributed to the *Japan Mail,* in May, 1886, an essay upon "Christianity in Japan." He referred to a scene witnessed seven years before at the graduation exercises of the University. The students had been acting very rudely, wearing their hats, coughing, and making various noises to interrupt the addresses. At last, as one of the speakers came upon the platform, he rebuked this conduct. The only effect was to increase the disturbance; but when the speaker announced that his subject was "Christianity," the hall was suddenly hushed into silence, while the students, one by one, removed their hats and all listened respectfully to hear what would be said by one who was known to be a strenuous opponent of the religion concerning which he was to speak. Great was their satisfaction when he fervently denounced it as the most hateful enemy of reason, of science, and of everything good. The essayist said of the students of that time: "We hated Christianity and Christians, because these words were in our minds synonymous with whatever was opposed to the honour and independence of the nation." A marvellous change, however, had been wrought in seven years. The persevering efforts of missionaries and native believers had doubtless been the principal agents in leading the nation to its present attitude towards Christianity; but they had been aided by various factors, political and social. Among the former was the problem of treaty revision, Mr. Fukuzawa and others having shown the people that in order to be treated as equals, their laws, system of government, education, and above all, religion, must be recast upon Western models. The attitude of the missionaries, who had said and written much in favour of a revision of the treaties, had won the good will of the people. Moreover, the religion of Christ was believed to be favourable to those principles of human equality and liberty that a majority of progressive young men were advocating, and thus they had been led to regard that religion in an entirely different light from that shed upon it by their traditional prejudices. Under social influences the writer referred to the impressions that had been made upon students who had studied abroad, and to the closer relations that had been established between Japanese and the foreign residents. Among the principal reasons for what the essayist regarded as slow progress in gaining converts, he mentioned sectarian strife, want of funds, and the failure of missionaries to present Christianity in the form best suited to the national genius of the Japanese. Enlarging on the last point, he urged the teaching of Christianity "in its rationalistic aspect" without superstition, he being convinced that in its rigid, orthodox form it would never obtain any general or firm hold on the minds of educated Japanese. He would have the native churches become as soon as possible entirely independent, and as a help to this they should be united. They should cut themselves "entirely free from the history of Christianity in the West and begin a new experience on an entirely new and enlightened basis—a basis laid in the Bible and preserved from decay by the healthy light of modern science."

A writer in the *Tokyo Independent* recommended Unitarianism as a state religion and would reconcile a belief in one God with Shinto rites by considering the shrines erected in honour of emperors and heroes to be like mausoleums of such great men as Napoleon and Washington.

The desire for Western civilisation was naturally accompanied by increased interest in the study of the English language. In 1885 forty thousand books were imported from England and fifty-nine thousand from America; while in 1886 the numbers increased to eighty-five thousand and one hundred and nineteen thousand respectively. The efforts of the Government to have English taught in the public schools was hampered by the lack of teachers. Mission schools were crowded. In several places the native Christians established schools and urged missionaries to aid in the teaching. In other cities, companies largely or wholly composed of non-believers proposed to establish schools that should be taught by missionaries and native Christians, more or less freedom being given them to teach the Bible and to exert a religious influence upon the pupils.

Among the schools was one established in Sendai. A wealthy and influential gentleman of that city, who had formerly been the Japanese Consul in New York, asked Mr. Neesima to lend his name to the founding of a school that it was hoped would gradually develop into a college like those of New England. This gentleman said that if the American Board would promise to furnish teachers for ten years, the people of Sendai would provide buildings, salaries for native teachers, and all other necessary funds. When Mr. Neesima with a member of the Mission visited Sendai, they were welcomed by the Governor and other prominent men, were told that five thousand *yen* was pledged for the new school, and were assured that its religious basis should be the same as that of the Doshisha, The Mission decided to accept the invitation. Rev. J. H. DeForest, D.D., was assigned to the work and others were at different times associated with him. The school was opened in October, 1886, the exercises including prayer and the reading of the Scriptures. Of the seven members of the faculty, six were Christians, though none of the patrons of the schools were professed believers. There were at first one hundred and twenty-two pupils. Twenty of these were baptised the first year. The Bible was one of the text-books, though its study was optional. The general exercises held each morning included a prayer.

A more formal opening of the school took place in June, 1887. It was attended by the Governor, Vice-Governor, Mayor, judges, generals, and leading citizens. Here, too, the Christian character of the school was openly declared.

At times the school was the object of severe attacks by the local press and by persons who were opposed to the teaching of Christianity. At last the prefectural government decided to establish another school of similar grade. This was in accordance with the policy of the Educational Department, which was opposed to private schools. Knowing that financial reasons would make it impossible to contend against this new difficulty, the teachers decided to resign. The closing exercises in 1891, like those that opened the school four years before, were attended by officials and prominent citizens, much regret being expressed that an institution which had done such good work must be closed. The experiment of a Christian school supported and governed by non-Christians was thus brought to an untimely end. It was felt, however, by the American Board Mission that the strength expended on it had not been lost. Several of the students had become Christians, some of them entered the theological or other departments of the Doshisha, and much evangelistic work had been done in the city by the teachers.

Another school was opened at Sendai in the same year as the one we have been considering; and the histories of the two institutions present points of comparison that perhaps are not without instructive lessons. The second school in its beginning did not attract much attention, nor did it enjoy the favour of prominent citizens. The prospects of permanence and future influence seemed less promising than those of the other. Some time previous to this, evangelistic work had been begun in Sendai by Rev. Oshikawa Masayoshi and another preacher. In 1886 Rev. W. E. Hoy of the Reformed \(German\) Church in the United States took up his residence in the same city; and in June of that year he and Mr. Oshikawa gathered seven young men, candidates for the Christian ministry, into a class that was at first held in an old dwelling house on the outskirts of the city. After one or two removals it had in 1888 a small building of its own, the pupils then numbering twenty-eight. When a new brick building was dedicated in 1892, there were seventeen theological and one hundred and thirty-three other students. Though not free from difficulties and vicissitudes, the school that began so humbly has in the main been prospered, and as the Tohoku Gakuin has become one of the most influential Christian institutions in the land.

Somewhat similar to the history of the first of these Sendai schools was that of one opened in Niigata, although in this case the leading trustees were Christians. The school met with much opposition from Buddhists and others. It also suffered from internal dissensions; one of its presidents and afterwards the principal of the school attempting to eliminate Christianity, and to minimise the influence of missionary teachers. Financial difficulties that here, as in Sendai, were intensified by the establishment of a government school, finally necessitated the abandonment of the enterprise.

Several schools for girls were started about this time under Christian auspices. An incident occurring in Niigata Prefecture shows how the desire for education had penetrated into even this, one of the most backward sections of the country. Four girls who were eager to obtain an education, resolved that they would either do this or die in the attempt. They took a solemn oath by which each promised to commit suicide unless she could induce her family to send her to school. One of them wrote a letter to the principal of an academy, and the reply fell into the hands of her parents, who severely rebuked her, saying that women did not need an education. After listening in silence to their reproofs, she went to her own room and there committed suicide. The brother of another of these girls was a student in the Tokyo Imperial University. After his graduation she begged him to take her with him to Tokyo and put her in a girls' school. He showed no sympathy with her desires, and she also took her own life. The third girl became a Christian. This led to her being so severely persecuted by her parents that she was driven into insanity. The fourth of the band, more fortunate than the others, was allowed to enter the normal school in Niigata.\*

The year 1886 witnessed a renewed interest in the cause of temperance. This was aroused by lectures delivered in many cities by Mrs. Mary Clemmer Leavitt, who had come from America as the representative of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Several temperance societies were formed under Christian auspices, though in many cases persons of other faiths became members. One of the most active of these societies was organised a year later in Sapporo. Taking the name "Hokkaido Temperance Society," it organised branches in different parts of the island of Yezo. In 1894 it had two thousand members. Most of the organisations in Japan united after a time in a National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which established its headquarters in Tokyo, where it published a paper and other literature.

The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, established a mission in 1886. The same year a lecture-room holding seventeen hundred persons was erected for the Young Men's Christian Association in Osaka, by means of gifts sent by friends in England, America, and Australia. Thus was supplied a need that had long been felt in that city for a large auditorium under the control of the Christians.

While most of the churches were rejoicing in great prosperity, there were in several places special manifestations of the Holy Spirit's presence. A letter describing what occurred in the Girls' School connected with the English Church Mission in Osaka says:

"The blessing of a revival which God graciously granted to many of his servants in Japan, foreign as well as native, extended also to some of the older girls in the school, who gave proof that they had been drawn nearer to God. Emotions of envy and jealousy, deeply rooted, were mutually confessed and wept over, and pardon was sought for them in united prayer, and the girls began to love each other more sincerely and cordially."

In November, 1886, a noteworthy revival began in Sendai. The churches of different denominations had united in a series of meetings. Large audiences gathered, and many of the Christians were so impressed that they went into the fields or to the hills for prayer, it always being difficult in a Japanese house to obtain privacy. Others remained in the church until three o'clock in the morning. Some went to the houses of the pastors to confess their sins and seek help, while many made a public acknowledgment of their sins. Persons who had before shown no sympathy with revivals now acknowledged their mistake. The report of these things spread abroad and led to the holding of similar meetings in other cities.

In view of the advance being made in the various departments of work and of the calls that were coming from all parts of the field, it is not strange to find one missionary writing: "The avalanche of opportunities that slides down upon us almost stuns us." Yet there were sections of the country where even fairly intelligent men knew nothing of the great changes that were coming upon their land. One of these persons, who lived among the mountains of Yamato, came on business to the town of Shingu in the province of Kii. In the evening he lodged at the house of a friend whom he had not seen for years. As the two sat talking together, the master of the house inquired:

"Have you ever heard anything about Christianity?"

His guest, with a frightened air, lowered his voice, and said: "Be cautious. If you talk of such things, you will surely be beheaded."

"What makes you think so?"

"Why, are you so ignorant as not to know that Christianity is strictly prohibited?"

"Can it be," said the host, "that you are unaware of the great changes that have taken place? We are now free to believe in Christianity. In this city there is a church of which I am a member, and it is constantly growing larger and larger."

"I never dreamed of such a thing. I myself am a Christian, For ten generations the religion has been handed down in our family from father to son. I supposed that the laws against it were still in force, and so I have never told others of my faith. God be praised if I am now at liberty to speak of it\!"

He was instructed by his friend and a few months later became a member of the Shingu Church.

The year 1887 is to be remembered among other things for various movements having for their aim the bringing together of churches that had hitherto been separate. We have already seen how several Presbyterian churches were united in one. In a similar way the Episcopalian churches were now brought together. The missionaries of the Church Missionary Society, of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and of the American Episcopal Mission had already joined in the preparation of a Prayer Book and in other matters of common interest. They had also sought the approval of home churches for the formation of a united church whose doctrinal basis should be the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-nine Articles. The Convention of the American Episcopal Church had in 1886 disapproved of the acceptance of the Articles. In February, 1887, the missionaries met with delegates of the churches in a synod that was thus described by Bishop Bickersteth:

"It was a freely elected body, in which Europeans and Americans were greatly outnumbered by Japanese. Of the Japanese delegates the majority were men of education. In consequence, questions were discussed on their merits, not results merely accepted on authority. The main decisions arrived at were unanimious. A Japanese Church was organised. A constitution was laid down on the basis of the Holy Scriptures, the Nicene Creed, the Sacraments, and the Three Orders. The Anglican Prayer Book and Articles were retained for present use. Regulations were made for the regular meeting of a Synod and local councils. A Japanese Missionary Society was set on foot."

The name adopted for this organisation was Nippon Sei-Ko-Kwai \(Holy Catholic Church of Japan\). At that time it had about thirteen hundred members.

By the passage of the following resolution, the Episcopalian missionaries expressed their desire for a more comprehensive union:

"This United Conference of Missionaries of the Church of England and of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America, now assembled in Osaka, wishes to place on record the desire for the establishment in Japan of a Christian Church which, by imposing no non-essential conditions of communion, shall include as many as possible of the Christians of this country."

A committee was appointed "to enter into communication on the subject with any committee that may be authorised to act in like manner on behalf of other Christian bodies in Japan."

Unfortunately for the success of this movement, Bishop Bickersteth, who as Chairman reported this action to the secretaries of other missions, said in his letter: "May I ask your acceptance at the same time of a copy of two sermons which I have lately published," and included these with the other document. Among other passages in the sermons, the following attracted attention, since it was naturally supposed to indicate the kind of "union" that was desired. In speaking of the Anglican communion, the Bishop said:

"Nor can I doubt, more expecially if we are given liberty after careful thought to lay aside all that is purely national in our system and formularies, and which will not, however needful to ourselves, bear transplanting into another soil, that by degrees many noble-hearted workers for God who now stand apart from us will, with those whom under many forms they have led to Christ, find a rallying point in the only Communion which, if I judge rightly, has touch and contact with them all. The Holy Scriptures, the Creeds, the Orders of the Ministry, and the Sacraments, together with the initial rite of Confirmation, include all that seems to me essential to a Church which would abide in the teaching and fellowship of the Apostles."

The Mission of the American Board, in replying to this communication, expressed its sympathy with all desires for strengthening the bonds of union between Christians, but drew attention to the fact that it had no ecclesiastical relations with the churches that had grown up in connection with its work, and that these churches must decide for themselves about any action looking towards union with others. At the same time, it expressed its readiness to send a committee to any conference where it might be desirable to have it represented *as a mission.*

The Council of Missions Connected with the United Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\) replied at considerable length, asking the meaning of the resolutions, calling attention to several expressions in the Bishop's sermons, and saying that representatives of their Church could not meet those of another except upon terms of absolute ecclesiastical equality.

This letter led to an animated correspondence. Bishop Bickersteth, writing as an individual, expressed regret that he had not sent the sermons in a separate enclosure, since they were not to be taken as necessarily representing the views of the Conference. He was also grieved that umbrage had been given by his use of the word "non-conformist" in speaking of those not connected with the Episcopalian Church, and said that "in consultation, the representatives of the various missionary societies would meet on a footing of perfect equality, as being alike by virtue of their Baptism members of Christ's Church."

The Secretary of the Council, in referring to the sentence last quoted, objected that the proposed conference would then be that of a body of private Christians, not a company of ministers and laymen representing various churches. In another letter he said that a committee of the United Church would be glad to meet with the Episcopalian committee if it were understood that the episcopate was not to be taken as one of the essentials of the proposed Church, and if the conferees could meet as equals.

The replies of other missions, so far as made public, were more formal, and the whole matter was dropped.

A union of the United Church of Christ in Japan and the Kumi-ai \(Congregational\) Churches had often been advocated, and in order to have a conference between the two bodies it was decided that in May, 1887, each should hold its annual meeting in Tokyo, At these meetings a joint committee was appointed which drew up a general plan embodying a basis of union. This having been approved by each side, a larger committee was entrusted with the duty of preparing standards of doctrine and government, which should be submitted to the churches at least six months before special meetings of each body that should be convened for their consideration. In May, 1888, it issued a report that included the draft of a constitution and by-laws. During the six months now available for the consideration of the plan, it became evident that, save for the strong objections of two Japanese ministers who considered that important doctrines were not sufficiently safeguarded, the work of the committee was regarded with favour by the United Church. Among the Kumi-ai Churches, however, adverse criticism soon began to be heard. They were unaccustomed to such minute rules and feared that the liberty of the local churches would be lost. While most of the missionaries of the American Board were in favour of the proposed union, two of their number issued pamphlets in which they drew attention to what they considered objectionable in the plan. Protests against it appeared in two American religious journals, and the Associations of the Congregational Churches of California and Nebraska passed votes in which it was suggested that, in case the union took place, the American Board might well withdraw financial aid. A number of young men in Tokyo became active opponents of the proposed scheme of government. Accordingly, when the meetings were held in November, the United Church had but three or four changes to suggest in the plan of the committee; while the Kumai-ai Churches hesitated about taking any action. Several churches declined to send delegates, saying that more time was needed for deliberation. Others sent representatives who were to hear and report what was said, but were not empowered to vote on the main question. Several days were spent in discussion, and it was decided to postpone action until the annual meeting in May, 1889. A committee was appointed to receive from the churches proposals of amendment and to confer with the committee of the United Church concerning revision.

As described by one who favoured its adoption, the revised constitution finally prepared did "not so much change the character of the basis of union as make its real meaning and nature plain and tend towards brevity." The Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Articles of the Evangelical Alliance were to be the standards of doctrine. The Westminster Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, and the Plymouth Declaration were "to be held in veneration," since "they have served a high purpose in the past, and are still to be regarded as of lasting value for the instruction and edification of believers." Local churches could adopt such forms of internal organisation as they deemed advisable. Certain powers, however, were to be delegated to two bodies, called *Bukwai* and *Sokwai.* The former were local associations made up of a pastor and delegate from each church within their respective bounds. They would license preachers; ordain, retire, and discipline ministers; install and release pastors at the request of churches; organise or aid in organising churches; afford counsel and aid to those within their bounds; appoint representatives to the *Sokwai;* and decide cases of discipline referred to them by the churches. The *Sokwai,* an annual meeting of representatives from the *Bukwai,* was to receive and impart information concerning the work of the Church; to recommend such measures as it deemed expedient; to organise *Bukwai;* and to decide cases of discipline referred to it by them.

Though there had been some adverse criticism, it was the general expectation when the annual meetings opened in May, 1889, that both bodies would vote in favour of union; and it seems probable that, had the two meetings been in the same city so as to afford opportunities for consultation, some ground of agreement would have been found. The United Church, which met in Tokyo, desired only a few minor changes in the revised constitution; the Kumi-ai Churches, whose delegates met in Kobe, voted in favour of more radical amendments. Misunderstandings arose that might perhaps have been removed by conference. The United Church did, indeed, send a committee to Kobe; but owing to the failure of a telegram to reach the proper person, the Kumi-ai convention had adjourned before the committee's arrival. Though the question of union between the two bodies nominally remained open for another year, it had practically been settled in the negative.

The year 1887 saw the opening of two forms of philanthropic work—the Nurses' Training School in Kyoto, and the Orphan Asylum in Okayama. The former was established through the efforts of J. C. Berry, M.D., and from the first won the good will of the Japanese people. Its graduates were not only in demand for private nursing, but were also in many cases sought for important positions in government hospitals.

The Okayama Orphanage originated in the love and devotion of Mr. Ishii Juji, a native of the province of Hyuga, whence he had gone to Okayama for the study of medicine. He there became a Roman Catholic; but study of the New Testament, combined with other influences, led him to join a Kumi-ai church. While in the medical school, in order to obtain funds for his own support and that of a friend whom he was aiding, he worked evenings as a masseur. This gave opportunities to tell his patrons about his religious belief, so that several of them were led to accept Christianity, In 1886 George Müller visited Japan. Mr. Ishii was greatly stirred by the reports that he read of Mr. Midler's addresses and by accounts of his work for orphans. Ill health interrupting his studies, he went to a small village near Okayama, where he began to practise medicine. One day in June, 1887, a beggar woman with two children came to a hut near his house and remained there over night. Mr. Ishii carried a bowl of rice to the eight-year-old boy, who immediately passed it over to a crippled sister. The woman, who had gone out to beg, soon returned, and in reply to questions said that, though she could support herself and the girl, she could not earn enough for all three. Mr. Ishii at once offered to adopt the boy. The woman, after some hesitation, gave her consent. Mr. Ishii soon returned to Okayama, and there in September he rented an old Buddhist temple into which he moved with his family, the child above mentioned, and two other boys whom he had picked up. Though nearly at the end of his medical course, he decided to give up study and to consecrate his life to work for children. The number of those under his care rapidly increased, as did the number of friends who, on hearing of the good work, gave substantial proof of their interest in it. There were indeed seasons of trial. The asylum was "reduced at times to its last bucket of rice, but the prayer of faith has brought relief and sometimes just at the moment of dire need." Several instances are narrated that bear a close resemblance to those that Mr. Müller tells of wonderful deliverances in answer to prayer. Rev. J. H. Pertee, D.D., was almost from the first Mr. Ishii's counsellor and helper in this work, as also the channel through which contributions from foreign friends helped in providing the institution with buildings and funds for other purposes. The asylum became an incentive and a model for similar institutions in other parts of Japan.

The desire of women to learn Western ways afforded opportunities for reaching them by various indirect methods. In some places the missionary ladies taught cooking. Still more common were classes for instruction in knitting and sewing. By means of these, access was gained to many that otherwise could not easily have been reached. Such quiet work gave opportunity for conversation that frequently ran in religious lines, and sometimes one of the company would be detailed to read aloud while the others plied their needles. In many places it was possible to combine Bible study with these gatherings.

The call for teachers of English in public and private schools opened another means of influence. A committee connected with the Young Men's Christian Association was formed in New York, that sent out young men who were willing to spend three years in Japan, It was made known that these persons were open for engagement in schools where teachers of good education and upright characters were desired. Though they could say nothing in the public schools about religion, they did much to allay prejudice; and outside of school hours they gave Biblical instruction to those desiring it. Some of them became so much interested in the country that they ultimately entered the ranks of the missionaries.

The way in which high hopes were sometimes succeeded by disappointment was exemplified in Oyamada, a farming village in the province of Chikugo. It was defeated in a lawsuit that it had with another village concerning the division of land. The costs were so great that the inhabitants were heavily burdened with debt. By various devices they sought to gain help from their deities. Many of them on cold winter nights went without clothing to worship at a certain shrine and to bathe in icy waters. All their prayers were in vain. Then it was reported to them that Christian missionaries would be willing to pay a considerable sum to any person that would become a believer. About four hundred decided to take this method of retrieving their fortunes. When they learned that the report was incorrect, many of them relinquished all thought of becoming Christians. Others had become so dissatisfied with their former religion that they were still resolved to make a change. The people of a neighbouring village urged them not to give up their ancestral faith, and even proposed to use force in order to hold them back, Buddhist and Shinto priests, and also the prefectural governor, expostulated with them in vain. The villagers threw away or burned their idols and removed their own names from the records of the temples. Two men were sent to Nagasaki bearing a petition in which the heads of twenty-six families asked that some one be sent to teach them Christianity. On reaching the city, they began to make enquiries where they could find a missionary. A crafty fellow whom they met told them that if they would give him thirty *yen* with which to prepare a feast he would bring a missionary and intercede in their behalf. The money was paid to the man, who went to a Bible-store and told the one in charge of it that two persons desired to meet a missionary. The Bible-seller took them to Rev. A. B. Hutchinson of the Church Missionary Society. He sent a catechist to instruct the people, and when he himself visited the village several months later, he baptised seventy adults. The next year ninety-five adults and fifty-eight children were baptised. For some time Oyamada seemed "one of the brightest spots in Japan;" but, unfortunately, a few years later many of the people yielded to the strenuous efforts that were made to lead them back to their old beliefs. Several consented to sign a paper promising to give up the outward observance of Christianity on condition that certain wealthy men of the province would present the village with ten thousand *yen.*

It was in part owing to the suggestions of Japanese who, while abroad, had come in contact with Unitarianism, that the American Unitarian Association decided to send Rev. A. M. Knapp to Japan as a representative of its faith. Reaching Japan in 1887, he preferred not to be called a missionary but an envoy or ambassador that had come to "express the sympathy of the Unitarians of America for progressive religious movements in Japan, and give all necessary information to the leaders of religious thought and action in that country." He said:

"The errand of Unitarianism in Japan is based upon the now familiar idea of the 'sympathy of religions.' With the conviction that we are messengers of distinctive and valuable truths which have not here been emphasised, and that in return there is much in your faith and life which to our harm we have not emphasised, receive us not as theological propagandists but as messengers of the new gospel of human brotherhood in the religious life of mankind."

What has already been said of the views expressed by Mr. Fukuzawa and other writers shows that many persons were prepared to regard with favour a form of Christianity that minimised supernatural elements. Even some of the Buddhists joined in the welcome, though one reason for this may be found in the remark of a catechism published by the Shin sect: 'Unitarianism will not be productive of any positive benefit; but as it will be negatively useful in neutralising the evil effects of Christianity, we approve the spread of that religion for the sake of the country—nay, for the sake of our Shin sect." Mr. Knapp by interviews with influential men, by lectures, and by the use of the press, vigorously propagated his views. He was severely critical of the work and methods of other missionaries; so much so that a member of the liberal German Evangelical Protestant Mission, who to a considerable extent was in sympathy with Unitarian doctrines, wrote:

"I do not understand how it is that the representative of the American Unitarians, who has been residing in Tokyo for a year, takes an attitude apparently more friendly to Buddhists than to Christians. . . . I, too, had a time at my study-table at home when I thought that a fundamental change of methods of missions was desirable. But now I do not hesitate to confess that I do not know how missions in Japan, in particular Protestant missions, could labour more wisely or more in accordance with their aim."

Mr. Knapp himself was very much elated at the promising opening of his work. Returning in 1889 to America to report progress, he said at the annual meeting of the Unitarian Association that its messenger might "fairly claim that his work in its results during the past year has exceeded a hundred-fold the average of the orthodox worker." This success, however, did not consist in making converts, a work that he disclaimed any desire to undertake, hut in the fact that "one in a thousand of the Japanese had heard that there is such a thing as Unitarianism, and one in one hundred thousand understands what it is, and is more or less interested in its success." Mr. Knapp soon went again to Japan, this time accompanied by Rev. Clay MacCauley, D.D., as a colleague, and by three teachers who had been appointed to positions in Mr. Fukuzawa's school. Though these teachers disclaimed any connection with the Unitarian Mission, they sympathised with its work, and in various ways gave it their aid. In 1890 a Unitarian church was established in Tokyo, and the publication of a monthly magazine begun. The impression the movement made upon the Japanese is shown by an article written for the *Unitarian Review* of Boston, by Mr. Kishimoto Nobuta, a Kumi-ai Christian of liberal tendencies. He wrote:

"The first impression we have received is that Unitarianism has a strong sectarian spirit. This we anticipated to some extent; and this anticipation has been confirmed by the strange choice of a challenging title, *The Unitarian,* for its organ-magazine, and by the hostile attitude which articles contained in this magazine show towards the other sects of Christianity. The second impression is that Unitarianism is a philosophy rather than a religion. *The* *Unitarian* declares that Unitarianism is a positive religion; but among its advocates are found either those who are indifferent towards any religion or those purely agnostic or atheistic. Among them some of the noted Buddhist monks are also found. Strange to say, the Unitarianism of Japan shows a strong sympathy towards Buddhism, while it shows a strong hostile feeling towards its brother sects of Christianity. These facts have led our people to conclude that Unitarianism \(at least, the Unitarianism of Japan,\) cannot be a religion and that, if it can be a religion, it will be a religion of philosophers."

To this article the editor appended a note, saying of a prominent Unitarian clergyman:

"Mr. Williams, who has recently returned from a visit to Japan, writes us that Unitarianism *is* hostile to Orthodox theology, and that this has given our Japanese brother a false impression; that it sympathises with Buddhism no more than with Confucianism. But, as its policy is to recognise spiritual truth in all these religions, and to meet their adherents in a spirit of courtesy and free inquiry, this attitude has been naturally misunderstood by those to whom such a policy implies a distrust of Christianity."

Near the close of 1890, Mr. Knapp, on account of poor health, left Japan. The next year a school for teaching liberal theology grew out of courses of lectures on religious, ethical, and social topics. Gradually the teachers employed in Mr. Fukuzawa's school and others who had come out to the Mission withdrew, so that Dr. MacCauley was left alone.

As early as 1867 a company of several hundred Japanese had gone to Hawaii, where they found employment on sugar plantations. When the Imperial Government was established in power, it for a long time did not favour the emigration of its subjects; but in 1885 a treaty negotiated with Hawaii opened the way by which some thousands, mostly from the farming class, went thither to labour for terms of three or six years. The interest of the Christian people in Hawaii was aroused in these immigrants, and Dr. Hyde, a missionary of the American Board, established meetings for their benefit Near the close of 1887 Mr. Miyama, an evangelist connected with the Methodist Episcopal Mission to the Japanese and Chinese in San Francisco, visited the islands. The immigrants gladly received one that could speak to them in their own language. Sunday schools and other Christian services were established, and ere long a Japanese Young Men's Christian Association was organised. At this time the Japanese Consul was Mr. Ando Taro, a man deeply interested in the welfare of his countrymen. He had been much troubled by the amount of vice that prevailed among them. Though he had tried to work a reform by issuing notifications and in other ways, the condition of these people seemed to be growing worse. He saw with interest the good work accomplished by Mr. Miyama, of which he afterwards wrote:

"Gamblers threw away their dice, drunkards began to break their glasses, ruffians became gentle, and as a consequence the business of the Consul's office experienced a great falling off. Even such an obstinate anti-Christian as I could not help being taken with surprise. I thought for the first time that Christianity must be good, at least for ignorant people, if it is so influential as this."

Further study led Mr. Ando to a personal belief in Christ. The account of his religious experience was afterwards published in Japan as a tract, which was widely circulated and accomplished much good. In July, 1888, he with nine others was baptised and joined in a celebration of the Lord's Supper when Japanese, Americans, Hawaiians, Chinese, and Gilbert Islanders united in remembering the dying love of their one Master. An arrangement was made by which the Methodists co-operated with the Hawaiian Evangelical Association for continuing the work. They afterwards withdrew, but in 1894 again sent a preacher to Honolulu. The same year Rev. and Mrs. O. H. Gulick, who for twenty-two years had been connected with the American Board's Mission in Japan, removed to Honolulu. They had been born in Hawaii, where their parents had been missionaries; and hence they were well fitted to take charge of the work that the Evangelical Association was conducting among the Japanese. Because of the beneficial effect upon the labourers the managers of many plantations were glad to pay the money needed for the support of evangelists procured from Japan. In 1903 Rev. Doremus Scudder, D.D., who had at one time been a missionary of the American Board in Japan, went to Hawaii as superintendent of this work. In 1907 his place was taken by Rev. Frank S. Scudder. The Methodist Episcopal Church also sent American workers there to labour among the Japanese, Chinese, and Koreans.

In 1888 the Christian schools of Japan were at the height of their prosperity. For example, the Doshisha had in its Theological Department 80 pupils; in the Academic Department, 410; in the Preparatory Department, 208; and in the Girls' School, 180. One teacher wrote: "We should be quite overwhelmed with students if we had not made a strict resolution not to admit another student into the new class this year."

In the spring this school was visited by Count Inoue, who had just resigned the post of Foreign Minister. In an address to the students he expressed his approval of it as an institution that aimed "at the promotion of moral and intellectual culture equally and simultaneously." "We have made," he added, "progress in scientific knowledge. We may even hope to attain in this to a level with the Occident. How, then, can we rest satisfied with ethical systems adapted only to Oriental standards?" Though too much must not be made of complimentary speeches, the mere fact of the appearance of such a person at a Christian school showed a change in public sentiment. A few months later, the Doshisha was visited by the Head of the Household Department.

There was more substantial proof of the interest that influential men were taking in these schools. In November, 1888, there appeared in twenty of the leading journals of Japan a plea by Mr. Neesima for funds by which the Doshisha should be made a university. It began by telling how in his youth he had gone to America and obtained an education, of the desire he had imbibed to give his own people such opportunities as existed there, of the way in which he had been enabled to open the schools in Kyoto, and of his belief that the time had come for establishing a university. He had already been encouraged by contributions of one thousand *yen* each from Counts Okuma and Inoue, five hundred *yen* from Count Aoki, and sums varying from two thousand to six thousand *yen* from eight business men. Counts Ito and Katsu, and Viscount Enomoto had promised aid, as had also friends in America. The document abounded in references to Christianity. It said:

"To express our hopes in brief, we seek to send out into the world not only men versed in literature and science, but young men of strong and noble character by which they can use their learning for the good of their fellowmen. This, we are convinced, can never be accomplished by abstract, speculative teaching, nor by strict and complicated rules, but only by Christian principles—the living and powerful principles of Christianity— and therefore we adopt these principles as the unchangeable foundation of our educational work, and devote our energies to their realisation."

To this new enterprise Mr. Neesima now gave all his strength, alas\! too much enfeebled for such a great undertaking. Not only did he receive money and promises from individuals, but the Prefectural Assembly of Nagoya promised one thousand *yen,* and it seemed probable that some other prefectures, desiring a university in that part of Japan, might follow this example. Hon. J. N. Harris of New London, Connecticut, gave $100,000 gold for the establishment of a scientific department. Useless though such meditations may be, one cannot always refrain from thinking of history as it might have been written had not certain events occurred. Had Mr. Neesima's life been spared and had the reaction against Western ideas been postponed for a few years, it seems probable that there would have been established in Kyoto a strong Christian university whose influence would have greatly affected the educational and religious development of Japan.

Christian students were to be found in other than Christian schools. A graduate of the Doshisha, who was continuing his studies in the First Higher Middle School in Tokyo, conceived the plan of having a Young Men's Christian Association to bind together the believers that were in that school, the Imperial University, and the High Commercial School. It was feared that their number was hardly sufficient to make the organisation practicable; but to the surprise of those who called a meeting to consider the subject, there was an attendance of thirty young men, who earnestly expressed the belief that some sort of union would greatly help them in the Christian life. Instead of one association as had been proposed, three allied societies, one for each school, were formed, and thus a movement began that afterwards grew into an extensive work for students in public and private schools.

Another movement in connection with education may find mention in this place. Beginning with 1876, several kindergartens had been opened in connection with the public schools of Japan. To missionaries acquainted with Froebel's ideas, these institutions, where religious teaching and influence were excluded, seemed very imperfect. It also seemed to them that Christian kindergartens might be effective instruments for exerting a helpful influence upon children and upon the families to which they belonged. The Presbyterian Mission had opened one in Tokyo sometime previous to 1887. In that year Miss Annie L. Howe, an enthusiastic advocate of the system, was sent to the Mission of the American Board that she might open a school in Kobe for the training of kindergartners. In 1888 she gave instruction to a few pupils and thus laid the foundations of what soon became a flourishing training-school. The same year she was invited to give lectures on kindergarten methods to the students of the High Normal School in Tokyo. These were printed for the use of teachers in the government kindergartens. The Christian women of Kobe raised money for the establishment of a kindergarten where their own children might be educated, and this gave those being trained as teachers an opportunity for practical instruction. The graduates from the training-school were soon in great demand, not only for Christian kindergartens, but also for those established by the government.

In sad contrast with the kindergartens where laughing, innocent children engage in happy games and pleasant occupations are the prisons with their bars and locks, and with the clanking chains that fetter the movements of the gloomy inmates. Yet Christianity seeks everywhere its opportunities to help men, and He who took the children in His arms to bless them said that a part of His mission was to preach deliverance to captives. We have already seen how at times Japanese prisons had proved fertile fields for Christian effort, and some further incidents may here be related.

The Kumi-ai Church in Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku had obtained permission to have some one go every noon to the local prisons and preach to any that cared to listen. Usually about fifty persons attended these services. On rainy days the evangelists would enter the rooms of the prison to explain the Bible to those that desired it. This teaching was made more effective by the change in the conduct of the chief warden, who had been led by a missionary lady to accept Christ as his Saviour, Whereas he had formerly been very severe in his treatment of the prisoners, he now became forbearing and kind. In 1888 a man that had been convicted of murdering three persons was in prison awaiting the day set for his execution. He was led by the evangelist to repentance and a belief in Christ. On the fatal day he was brought to the place of execution, where his eyes were bandaged and the official sentence of condemnation was read to him. He was then asked whether there was any article of food or drink that he would like to receive as a last favour before suffering the penalty of the law. The man replied that he would soon be beyond thoughts of hunger and thirst, and so he would be glad to have the cost of the promised gift spent in buying some delicacy for any of the prisoners that might be ill. Then, having received permission to pray, he did so in the following words, as they were reported by one of the officials:

"Heavenly Father, I have been a great sinner and must now die for my crimes; but while I was in prison Thou didst greatly bless me by opening my heart, baptising me with the Gospel of Jesus, and filling my soul with joy and peace through the atonement that He made on the cross. At this time of suffering the penalty of death, Thou hast given me hope and everlasting peace. O Father, now I go to Thee. Receive my soul. I beseech Thee, O Father, have mercy on my mother and my sister. I beseech Thee to lead them to believe in Thee. As Thou hast saved me, I beseech Thee to save all these my brother and sister prisoners who are in this jail."

Rising from his knees, he made a few last requests to the warden. The principal one was: "Please see that my aged mother and my young sister soon learn to know the truth as it is in Jesus, and become believers. Please say to them that this is my dying wish and legacy." The man's evident sincerity made a deep impression on all the officers that were present.

Not all prisoners are hardened criminals. In December, 1887, a number of persons had gone to Tokyo in order to petition the Government in behalf of certain political reforms. The Government issued "Regulations for the Preservation of the Public Peace," and commanded the leading petitioners to leave the city. Some of them thought it their duty to protest against what they considered a tyrannical order by disobeying it. They were arrested and sent to prison. Some of these were men that afterwards occupied high official positions. Among them was Mr. Kataoka Kenkichi, a Christian, who a few years later became Chairman of the National House of Representatives, Another Christian has written an interesting account of his own experiences at this time. When arrested, he had taken his Bible, but was told that the rules prohibited prisoners from bringing anything with them. Saying that he was a Christian and therefore felt the need of a Bible, he asked permission to petition for one; but the keeper refused to forward his request to the higher authorities. Afterwards it was learned that the Department of Home Affairs had refused to let the Christians have Bibles. At a later date this restriction was removed, and the writer feelingly describes the great joy with which he spent the moments of leisure from menial and distasteful tasks in perusing the sacred pages. He also says:

"After we were permitted to have the Bible and other religious books, many of the prisoners who were not believers began to read them. As many as five hundred of them read more or less, some of them became earnest Christians and gave us great joy. Several of these, as they went out to labour or to become nurses in the hospital, became the means of spreading the story of God's love among other prisoners, and some were converted. Thus we were not imprisoned in vain. It was the will of God that we should receive training in a practical school of theology."

A still more noteworthy event in connection with prisons was the appointment of men as teachers of morality; or, since Christians were deliberately chosen and were expected to use Christian methods and motives, they might be called chaplains. In the northern island of Yezo large prisons had been established to which were sent criminals from all parts of Japan who were under sentence of twelve years or more. The newly appointed warden of one of those prisons, a man who was earnest in seeking the welfare of those under his charge, was convinced that they could be most helped through some one imbued with the principles of Christianity, Hence he secured the services of Mr. Hara Taneaki as instructor in morals. A little later, Rev. Tomeoka Kosuke was given a similar position in another prison. Both of these men have since become widely known for what they have done to help prisoners, discharged convicts, and wayward youths. At one time, all five of the prisons for long-sentence criminals had such chaplains. In addition to the ethical instruction given to all the inmates, they taught Christianity to those who desired to learn about it, were ever ready to give helpful counsel to those that sought personal interviews, and in other ways exerted an influence that proved the means of fitting many to lead upright lives after their terms of imprisonment were over. This good work continued until in 1895 a new superintendent of the prisons imposed restrictions that led to the withdrawal of the chaplains.

The period of rapid development may be considered as closing with the year 1888, The check was not so sudden that the succeeding years did not show considerable growth; such growth, indeed, as in some other countries would have filled the hearts of missionaries with great joy. Those in Japan had seen such rapid growth that their hopes had been unduly excited, and thus the years of comparative unproductiveness caused great disappointment. The statistics of the Protestant missions for 1888 show something of what had been accomplished up to that time. There were 150 male missionaries, 27 unmarried male missionaries, and 124 unmarried female missionaries; making a total, including wives, of 451. Of 249 churches, 92 were wholly self-supporting, The church-members numbered 25,514,\* the adult baptisms for a year being 6,959; boys' schools had 2,709 pupils, while 39 girls' schools had 3,663, There were also 47 day schools with 3,299 pupils, 14 theological seminaries with 287 students, 3 schools for Bible-women with 92 pupils, and a school for nurses with 14 pupils. There were 142 ordained Japanese ministers, 257 unordained preachers and helpers, 8 colporteurs, and 70 Bible-women. The contributions of the Christians for all purposes in a year amounted to 64,454 *yen,* a *yen* at that time being worth about three-fourths of a gold dollar.

Christianity had gained the respect and to a considerable extent the approval of many outside of the churches. It was indeed true then, as it has always been, that some travellers, spending a few weeks in Japan without visiting Christian schools or churches, but taking up the loose talk that prevails on the steamers and in the smoking-rooms of hotels, went back to write books and articles in which they declared that the missionaries were accomplishing nothing. In some cases people with better opportunities for informing themselves allowed dislike of missionaries and their teaching to blind their eyes to what was going on. The Unitarian workers were inclined, as we have seen, to belittle what others were doing; and some of their coreligionists in America seemed glad to believe that evangelical missionaries were labouring in vain. An example of this was seen the next year in the reception accorded to Mr. \(afterwards Baron\) Kaneko Kentaro, and the remarks he made before the officers of the American Unitarian Association, which were reported in full in the *Christian Register,* a Unitarian paper published in Boston. Mr. Kaneko was at this time a secretary of the Privy Council, and had been sent to America and Europe to examine the parliamentary systems of different countries. Among other remarks derogatory to missionaries he said: "The missionary idea has never penetrated the upper classes. They report a large number of converts, but we see little or no sign of their influence." This remark led Rev. D. C. Greene, D.D., to write an article in which he spoke of the headway Christianity was making among the influential classes. He showed that, although the *shizoku* \(those formerly belonging to the military class, and at this time including most of the leaders of thought\) constituted less than six per cent, of the population, they furnished about thirty per cent, of the church-members. He then went on to say:

"Not less than thirty students of the Imperial University are avowed Christians. Among the members of a single Congregational church are a judge of the Supreme Court of Japan, a professor in the Imperial University, three Government secretaries \(holding a rank hardly, if any, inferior to Mr. Kaneko himself\), members of at least two noble families; while in a Presbyterian church are the three most prominent members of the Liberal Party, one of them a count in the new peerage. Two influential members of the legislature of the prefecture of Tokyo, one of them the editor of the *Keizai Zasshi,* the ablest financial journal in Japan, are also members of a Congregational church. In the prefectures of Kyoto and Ehime, the Christians have two representatives in each local legislature. In the prefecture of Gumma, the President and Vice-President and three other members of the legislature are Christians, and in the Executive Committee, out of a total of five, three are Protestant Christians."

Though these words were written a few months later, they were true of the conditions at the close of 1888. The list of Christians belonging to the influential classes, as given by Dr. Greene, might have been considerably lengthened. Indeed, among some Christian workers it was a cause for regret that the progress thus far made had been so disproportionately among those usually designated as the "upper-middle" classes, and the question was often asked how those belonging to the lower strata of society could be reached more effectively.

These churches, which had grown up in connection with the work of the American Board Mission, had at first no distinctive name. They would gladly have continued to be known simply as Christian churches; but some convenient way of designating them became almost a necessity. It became evident that, if they did not choose some name for themselves, one would be fastened upon them by others; and at last, with considerable reluctance, they formally adopted the title "Kumi-ai." Though it might be more convenient for most readers of this book to have the term "Congregational" used for these churches, their own preferences in the matter make it better to keep the Japanese word.

### THE PERIOD OF RETARDED GROWTH   1889-1900





JAPAN is a country of sudden changes. The bright prospects that gave rise to the hope that the country would be speedily evangelised were soon clouded over. Missionaries are usually optimists, and it seemed to most of them that the storm would quickly pass and the sun would then shine out as brightly as before. In the correspondence of the period now to be reviewed the hopes of the writers frequently find expression in such words as, "The worst is over," "The reaction has spent its force," "Things are looking brighter than they have for a long time," etc. Yet a full decade must pass ere there would be any very marked improvement, and even then the rate of apparent progress would be much slower than it had been before the reaction set in.

The reasons for the retardation in the advance of Christianity were numerous. Among them much prominence must be given to a great reaction against the acceptance of Western civilisation. The *Japan Mail* of April 27, 1889, writing of the way this had arisen said:

"The fall of 1887 found the nation beginning to be pervaded by the apprehension that it had travelled too rapidly; that it was in danger of losing individuality altogether; and that the way to compete with foreign countries was not to follow in their wake by copying their example, but rather to strengthen and develop the faculties that belong especially to the genius of the country. This conviction has now passed into the cry of the day. Under the name of *Kokusui Hozon* \(Preservation of the National Excellencies\) it is recognised as the guiding principle, the first duty of the present generation. It is talked of, written about, and even embodied in song. It inspires the lectures that are delivered before scientific and political associations, and it manifests its influence in a thousand directions of everyday life. Even Buddhism has taken advantage of it, and endeavoured to rekindle the embers of a faint faith by connecting the dignity of the throne with the permanence of Shaka's doctrine."

The movement of the Buddhists took shape in the establishment of the *Sonno Hobutsu Dai Do dan* \(Great Association for Honouring the Emperor and Preserving Buddhism\). The prospectus of this society as translated by the *Japan Mail* said:

"This Association is formed for the purpose of maintaining the majesty *of* our Emperor and the truth of the doctrine of Buddha—a union of all those who wish to protect our land and religion from the contempt of the foreigner. Those who unite with us are expected to avoid everything that would lessen the honour and reverence due to His Imperial Majesty or the influence of the Buddhist doctrine. For instance, in selecting our representatives to the national parliament, to provincial assemblies, to town councils, or local offices, in the distribution of all honours, in appointing school-teachers, officials of societies and business companies, etc., we pledge ourselves carefully to exclude all who are disloyal to our Emperor or untrue to Buddhism by believing in the foreign religion called Christianity. If these points are kept well in mind and carried into practice, we, thirty-nine million of brethren united into one, will so protect our country that, although many a difficulty and many an internal social and political problem may arise, still our Emperor's position shall stand secure and the doctrine of Buddha shall remain unshaken. Yes, if we but stand together on this solid foundation of truth, the result will be that no foreign land will point at us with the finger of scorn. Now, brothers, if you can see the truth as here stated, do not hesitate to come up and join our band. Give us your hand; we shall then all stand together and add to the strength and life of our *Yamato-damashii* \(Spirit of Old Japan\)."

Important political events excited the minds of the people and made it harder to gain their attention for the consideration of Christianity. February 11, 1889, the new Constitution was promulgated. The conflict of new and old ideas was exemplified the same day by the assassination of Viscount Mori, the Minister of Education, because of an act of irreverence that he was alleged to have committed some time before by lifting with his walking-stick the curtain that hung before the holy place in the great Shinto shrine at Ise. In the autumn of the same year great excitement arose over the question of treaty revision. The treaty with America negotiated in 1858 by Townsend Harris, and those with other nations modelled upon it, provided for a system of extra-territoriality by which, if a citizen of one of the treaty powers committed a crime or was defendant in a civil suit, he was tried in the consular court of his own nation. Also the amount of duty that could be levied on imports was limited. Mr. Harris, who desired to treat the Japanese in the most friendly way possible, and who hoped that after a few years such restrictions could safely be modified if not wholly removed inserted in his treaty an article providing that a revision "may be made" after July, 1872, if desired by either party. The wording was unfortunate, and at last it became practically necessary to get all the treaty powers to unite in assenting to a change before it could be made. The United States did indeed, at one time prepare a new treaty, but the Japanese Government, fearing the threat of other nations that under the "most favoured nation" clauses they would claim for themselves all the benefits granted even conditionally to another, insisted, contrary to the wish of the American Minister, on having an article inserted by which the agreement should come into force only when all the other powers had made similar treaties, and this proviso made the whole document worthless. For a long time there had been increasing irritation against Western nations for their unwillingness to yield to Japan's desires for control over her customs and the removal of extra-territoriality. In 1889, however, it was announced that treaties with all the nations were on the point of being ratified. They provided that for a few years to come foreign judges should sit with the Japanese upon the bench when cases concerning foreigners were to be tried. At once the ultra-patriots excited so strong opposition to a concession which they declared dishonourable that they caused the failure of the proposed plans. Dissensions in the Cabinet led to the resignation of the Minister President of State. A few days later Count Okuma, Minister for Foreign Affairs, was severely wounded by a person who attempted to assassinate him for assenting to the proposed arrangements. In addition to the excitement caused by these events, the minds of the people were much occupied by the election to local offices, and by preparations for the election of members to the first National Diet, which was to meet the next year. Political meetings were frequent and to some extent usurped the place that had been held by large public meetings for the preaching of the Gospel. These political gatherings were often very noisy and sometimes became the scenes of violence. It was perhaps partly a result of the turbulent habits thus formed that in places where Christian services held in theatres were formerly attended by quiet audiences, disturbances became common. Because of the difficulty of securing respectful attention, these mass meetings were less frequently held by the Christians.

Some of the causes of the lull in Christian work were in the Church itself. The early fervour had to some extent passed away. Whereas all of the Christians had once felt the responsibility for telling others about their new faith, and had been earnest in leading their friends to accept it, they were now inclined to leave the work of propagation almost entirely to the pastors and evangelists. In the days of rapid growth many persons had come into the churches who were far from being permeated with the spirit of Christ. Christianity was the religion of the West, and in their enthusiasm for Western civilisation they had taken the religion as one part of it; now, when seized by the wave of reaction, they wished to put away Christianity with other things that seemed opposed to the spirit of old Japan. It is easy now to say that more care should have been taken before admitting such persons to the churches; yet it is doubtful whether these are the persons whom more stringent rules would have excluded. The words with which they described their experiences and the earnestness that they displayed, seemed equal to what was found in others. In most cases there was no intentional deception on their part. To themselves as to others they seemed to be followers of Christ. Some that dropped out of the churches had been disappointed at the results of Christianity. It had seemed to them that its pure doctrines and exalted morality must speedily command the assent of all to whom it was made known, and that therefore, by its beneficent influence, the country would soon be purified from evil, and attain the exalted condition that they imagined had already been reached by Christian lands in the West. They found that the victory was not so easily gained. They saw some of the Christians fall into sin; they experienced the power of temptation in their own lives; they learned more and more of the terrible evils that still exist in so-called Christian lands; and they were led to doubt whether Christianity was indeed a great power for national and individual salvation.

The ultra-nationalistic spirit affected many of the prominent Christians. They wished to disprove the reiterated charge that they were the slaves of the foreigners. The desire to show their independence often led them to oppose the beliefs and the advice of the missionaries, which otherwise they might have accepted. It became the fashion among those who went to America or England to pay special attention to the defects of those countries. Their letters from these lands and their addresses after returning, told of evils that had convinced them that these countries were not superior to their own.

Theological speculations absorbed much energy, and in many cases were chilling to the faith. These were to some extent introduced by the "liberal" missions, but more through books and magazines coming from the West. These were eagerly read by many of the leading preachers, whose minds were naturally inclined to favour whatever was new. Here, too, the desire to show their independence inclined some of them to discard what they had received from their former teachers. While they imagined that their conclusions were reached by their own thinking, it was easy to trace the source of their views to opinions that were then being advocated in the West. Many of those that went abroad, even when supported by help gained through the mediation of missionaries, took more interest in seeking interviews with noted advocates of new opinions than in pursuing their studies in the schools to which they had been sent. It was felt that young men hardly showed that they had received any advantage from going so far for study if they returned with the same views that they had when setting out. When they came back to Japan, their friends asked them what new things they had learned. They must at least tell the theories they had heard, and in explaining these they frequently became, almost before they knew it, advocates of the views that at first they intended only to describe. As the narrative proceeds we shall see how, in these and other ways, divisive doctrines gained currency, the faith of many church-members was chilled, and there were defections among those who had been prominent preachers. Many of the less educated members of the Church, while understanding little of the questions under discussion, were stunned by the defection of their pastors, or by being told that much of what they had formerly been taught was false. The effects that intellectual wanderings have upon the spiritual and moral life are more marked in a country like Japan than in those where early education and a helpful environment may "hold men's hearts right after their heads go wrong."

While the exaggerated nationalism of that time led to a higher appreciation of what was distinctively Japanese, the people had gone so far in accepting Western ideas that they could not wholly give them up. Hence, much was said about an alleged characteristic of the Japanese, namely, that while they gladly borrow what is good in foreign lands, taking now from the West as formerly they had taken from China, they always modify and improve whatever they receive. Those who loved their country, it was said, ought to insist that everything coming from abroad should be remodelled so as to become really Japanese instead of foreign. Occasionally this contention took grotesque forms, as when in reply to criticisms on blunders in the use of English on the part of some who published articles in that language, it was soberly asserted that Japanese ought not to be bound by the grammatical rules observed in England and America, since they had the ability to produce a Japanese form of the English language that would be superior to the original. These phenomena that accompanied the awakening of national consciousness remind us of what Tourgenieff said of a similar period in Russian history: "Some young people among us have discovered even a Russian arithmetic. Two and two do indeed make four with us as well as elsewhere, but more pompously it would seem. All this is nothing but the stammering of men who are just awaking."

It was in accord with such sentiments that much began to be said about the necessity of having a "Japanese Christianity." In 1890, Mr. Yokoi, a prominent Kumi-ai minister, published an article in which he lamented that Christianity as then existing in Japan was in most cases a copy of that found in England and America. In the early experiences of the converts this could not be helped, but now they had obtained sufficient knowledge to be able to select what was suitable for themselves. The day had come for the development of a Japanese Christianity. Though in some points time and place could make no difference in the religion of Christ, in others there must be variety, and Christianity in Japan ought to exhibit some fine qualities not discernible in the older stock. Christianity in the Occident had developed on the basis laid by Greek literature and Roman jurisprudence. The Christianity about to spring up in the East must stand on the pedestal formed out of the religion of Buddhism and the Confucian philosophy. It was desirable to develop a system of theology that, in its essential characteristics should be purely Japanese, and to originate religious rites and ceremonies that should be peculiar to themselves. At first the converts had believed just what the foreigners had told them, and the early preachers, being supported by the missionaries, had refrained from expressing dissatisfaction with the teaching they received. Unless Christianity divested itself of foreign clothes and wore the Japanese dress, it would never accomplish its object. "The time has now come," he said, "for Japanese propagandists to form their own estimate of Christ and to make it known to their fellow-countrymen. We must henceforth think independently and construct without assistance so as to build a Church of Japan."\*

Probably most missionaries had recognised that Christianity in Japan must in many outward features differ from that of other countries. Dr. Eby's paper in 1884, on "The Immediate Christianisation of Japan," had said:

"What we have to do for Japan is to evangelise it, win it for Christ, and I for one care not a rush what church polity is chosen, if only the church be true to her living Head and preserve the soul of charity, the inspiration of living faith. Ecclesiastical form, philosophical statement of doctrine, etc. differ with every race. Whatever the future church of Japan may be, its Christianity will be a Christianity in Japanese mould, and any effort of ours to put the stamp of a hundred 'isms' upon it would be childish and futile."

Similar words might be quoted from other missionaries; but to say that differences must be expected to arise from national peculiarities is far different from urging that such variations be artificially stimulated for the sake of avoiding resemblance to what has been developed elsewhere.

Much began to be said about the desirability that Japanese churches should be independent of foreign dictation. Even missions that had disclaimed authority over churches were criticised as exerting control through their ability to refuse financial aid to men and work that did not meet their approval, and it was desired that funds from abroad should be put unconditionally into the hands of the Japanese. Much was said and written derogatory to the missionaries; and some preachers, especially the younger men, seemed to think that in addresses before unbelievers it would help them to win favour if they showed their independence of the foreign teachers by speaking in disparagement of them. Some of the criticisms pointed out real faults in the missionaries, others were childish; but what caused most sadness to those against whom they were directed was the spirit in which they were uttered, together with the injury that was done to the work by the manner in which they were made.

Some churches were much weakened by the work of the Plymouth Brethren, who came to Japan not far from the beginning of this period. It is not within the province of this history to discuss the principles or beliefs of any body of Christians, or to criticise its work; yet it is necessary to state facts, and whatever good may have been accomplished by the Plymouth Brethren, some of the results of their labours were disastrous. It is well known that there are several divisions among those calling themselves Plymouth Brethren, and some that bear the name are not to be included in the statement, which is true of most of them, that they did little to proclaim the Gospel to unbelievers, thinking it their duty to bear witness against what they regarded as the corruption of the churches, and to lead as many as possible away from them. Their efforts were sometimes only too successful. Persons who had been prominent church-members were led to withdraw. In some places churches were almost broken up; in others, where churches were on the point of being organised, this became impossible because some of the believers went over to the Plymouth Brethren. If such persons had retained their faith, the result would have been less deplorable; but many who thus gave up associating with Christians and getting the help derived from the pastors, fell into sin and unbelief.

The effect of the reactionary movements was speedily felt by the Christian schools and especially by those for the education of girls. Critics declared that the young women in these schools lost their gentle manners, becoming forward, mannish, and proud. There was considerable financial stress in the country, and many persons who had formerly sent their daughters to such schools found this to be one of the easiest points at which to economise. For these reasons the number of pupils was gradually reduced, and it was several years before interest in the education of women revived. The schools for boys had to contend against difficulties arising from the desire of the Educational Department to confine education to the schools established by the Government. At one time the best opportunities for acquiring a modern education had been furnished by Christian institutions; but the excellent system of schools established by the Government had raised the latter to a high standard. The large sums of money furnished for the institutions of high grade gave them better material equipments than those of the Christian schools. Not only did graduates of private schools find that it was difficult for them to enter the Imperial University and other higher institutions of learning, but in other ways private schools were discouraged by the Educational Department. As has already been stated, a Christian school in Sendai was discontinued because of this opposition, and the same was true of others. Some schools that were under the control of Japanese endeavoured to retain popularity by giving up religious exercises, refusing to be known as Christian institutions, or minimising the Christian features that had before characterised them. As we proceed we shall see how even the school founded by Joseph Neesima, which had been considered by opposers the chief citadel of Christianity in Central Japan, yielded to the pressure. Many things seemed to indicate that the Educational Department had determined to oppose Christianity itself. Certain it is that Christian teachers felt their positions to be very insecure, and that the Department winked at injustice done to Christian pupils. The simultaneousness of the warnings that teachers in all parts of the country gave to children in the lower schools, telling them they ought not to attend Christian Sunday schools, is not easily explained except on the supposition that in some way it was made known that such directions were in accordance with the wishes of the educational authorities.

The Army seemed to be another centre of opposition to Christianity, though the trouble experienced may have come from the commanders of the different garrisons. Soldiers were told not to attend Christian meetings nor to have Christian books in their possession. In some places Christian officers were pressed to withdraw from the membership of churches. The new Imperial Constitution, indeed, guaranteed religious liberty, and officers might have hesitated to inflict punishment for violation of the *quasi* orders that they gave; but privates and under-officers very well know that there were many ways in which their commanders, without any apparent violation of law, could make them suffer for having anything to do with Christianity. A great change, however, took place at the time of the war with China, as will be related in due time.

Such were some of the discouragements and difficulties of the period on which we are now entering; but as we turn to describe more in detail the course of events, we shall see that the churches still continued to grow, though at a retarded rate.

February 11, 1889, is an important date in the religious as in the political history of Japan; for in the Constitution that the Emperor then granted to his people, Article XXVIII. declares:

"Japanese subjects shall, within limits not prejudical to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects, enjoy freedom of religious belief."

It was but a little over seventeen years since men and women had been sent into exile for their religion, and now Count Ito Hirobumi in his commentary on the Constitutionthat he himself had been chief in preparing, said:

"The cruel treatment of those of a heterodox faith or the exclusion of them from the enjoyment of certain portions of public and civil rights are already historical facts of the past, and now-a-days it is very seldom, if ever, that such absurdities are brought to our notice. \(In the German states political rights were denied to the Jews up to the year 1846\)."

It is amusing to see this turning to European history as though for the last instance of religious persecution; but the forgetfulness of what his own land had witnessed can be forgiven in view of his declaration that "Freedom of conscience concerns the inner part of man and lies beyond the sphere of interference by the laws of the State."

The year 1889 saw many missions extending their work. The reaction had not yet begun to be seriously felt. The American Baptist Mission, which hitherto had been but feebly supported by the home board, received eleven new workers and was thus enabled to open a station in Shimonoseki besides strengthening those already established. The Baptist Southern Convention also sent out two families, whose plans concerning fields of labour were made in connection with the older mission of like faith.

The work of the Canadian Methodist Mission had reached such a stage that an annual Conference was organised. To ordained Japanese ministers and to the same number of laymen were given equal voice and vote with the missionaries in the organisation and developing of churches. Coincident with the establishment of the Conference was the inauguration of a policy that led to the opening of new stations and an enlargement of the work.

The Southern Methodist Mission in the same year founded at Kobe the Kwansei Gakuin, a school for young men, which soon came to hold a prominent place among educational institutions.

An attempt to combine the different Methodist Churches did not at this time get beyond the preparation of a "Basis of Union." The failure of the proposed plan for uniting the Presbyterian and Kumi-ai Churches has been already recorded.

An important movement among young men was begun in the spring of 1889 by Mr, L. D. Wishard, the International College Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association, who visited several cities in Japan, speaking to students. He made a great impression, not only upon the pupils of Christian schools, but also on those connected with government institutions. The Christian Associations organised the previous year in three of the schools in Tokyo were greatly strengthened, and similar societies were formed elsewhere. Mr, Wishard planned and conducted a "Summer School for Bible Study," the first of a series that has continued to be held annually. The work for young men was further helped by the locating in Tokyo of Mr. J. T. Swift as the representative of the Young Men's Christian Associations of the United States.

Almost synchronous with Mr. Wishard's visit was that of another American—Colonel Olcott, the theosophist. He had been invited by the Buddhists, who, in alarm at the progress being made by Christianity, were ready to accept help from any source. A speech made by Mr. Nagouchi, the man through whom the invitation had been conveyed to Colonel Olcott, shows the view that many Buddhists took of the situation. After speaking of the changes that had brought to Japan railroads, electric lights, newspapers, steam presses, sewing machines, whiskey, and cigarettes, he bemoaned the fact that many who were once interested in Buddhism gave themselves now to the study of physics, photography, biology, astronomy, geology, metaphysics, materialism, and Christianity, —subjects that now formed the dominant topics of thought and conversation. Much of this sad upheaval was to be laid at the door of the missionaries, who had met the desire of people for Western knowledge by establishing schools in all parts of the land. Moreover, whereas the Emperors were formerly warm supporters of Buddhism, so that many princes and princesses entered the monasteries, the present attitude of the Government was one of indifference, and Imperial contributions to the temples were now given only for the purpose of preserving the Imperial tombs. Most of the priests were lazy, wasting their time in amusements, repeating prayers whose meaning they did not know, and by worthless lives alienating the believers. "The different Buddhist sects," he said, "must be united, and every priest must be educated. To rescue our Buddhists from the thraldom of Western vices we have thought of only one way. It is to obtain the unselfish help of Colonel Olcott, the reformer of religion. All Japanese Buddhists are now awaiting his visit, and they have named him the Bodhisattva of the Nineteenth Century."

When Colonel Olcott arrived he was received with the greatest enthusiasm. Temples and houses were decorated in his honour; in the cities he visited he was met by committees of priests and leading citizens; and at first large crowds went to hear his addresses. The enthusiasm for the American Bodhisattva was short-lived. For some reason or other the series of lectures was interrupted, and Colonel Olcott soon left the country. It was reported that he was disappointed in the Buddhists of Japan; it is certain that they were disappointed in him.

The Christian Church in Japan, and especially the Kumi-ai body, met with a great loss in the death, January 23, 1890, of Dr.\* Joseph Neesima. He had been in Tokyo and vicinity trying to interest influential men in his plans for a Christian university, when severe illness led him to seek rest at the seaside resort of Oiso. There he died at the age of forty-seven. His death made a profound impression, not only on those that had been closely associated with him, but also upon many who, though having no sympathy with his religion, recognised that he had been a man of the noblest principles, who had in many ways brought great good to his country.

When his body reached Kyoto, the students of the Doshisha insisted that they alone should bear it to his former home and afterwards to the grave which they had dug with their own hands. This meant much in Japan, where such offices for the dead are left to the very lowest classes. Among the banners that according to Japanese custom were carried in the funeral procession, was one inscribed "From the Buddhists of Osaka," thus testifying to the respect in which Dr. Neesima was held by those that disagreed with him. This courteous act offset to a great extent the refusal of the priests of a temple in Kyoto to allow him to be buried beside his father in their cemetery, because he was "the very head of Christianity in Japan."

Another funeral that occurred in September of the same year attracted considerable notice. Mrs. Katsura, the wife of the Vice-Minister of War, was a member of a Kumi-ai church. At her death, the church was asked to assume charge of the funeral services. More than two thousand persons were in attendance, including one prince, three minsters of state, military officers, and foreign diplomatic officials. Owing to the smallness of the chapel at the Aoyama Cemetery, only three or four hundred could listen to the religious exercises; but these heard an impressive sermon on the Christian's hope of immortality through Christ. The presence of such persons at a Christian service was another proof of the change that had come since the days of official persecution.

October 30, 1890, the Emperor sent forth what has ever since been known as "The Imperial Rescript on Education," a document that had a great influence on the religious history of Japan. The following is a translation issued in 1907 by the Department of Education:

"Know ye, Our subjects: Our Imperial Ancestors have founded Our Empire on a basis broad and everlasting, and have deeply and firmly implanted virtue: Our subjects ever united in loyalty and filial piety have from generation to generation illustrated the beauty thereof. This is the glory of the fundamental character of Our Empire, and herein also lies the source of Our education. Ye, Our subjects, be filial to your parents, affectionate to your brothers and sisters; as husbands and wives be harmonious, as friends true; bear yourselves in modesty and moderation; extend your benevolence to all; pursue learning and cultivate arts; and thoroughly develop intellectual faculties and perfect moral powers; furthermore, advance public good and promote common interests; always respect the Constitution and observe the laws; should emergency arise, offer yourselves courageously to the State; and thus guard and maintain the prosperity of Our Imperial Throne coeval with heaven and earth. So shall ye not only be Our good and faithful subjects, but render illustrious the best traditions of your forefathers.

"The Way here set forth is indeed the teaching bequeathed by Our Imperial Ancestors to be observed alike by Their Descendants and the subjects, infallible for all ages and true in all places. It is Our wish to lay it to heart in all reverence in common with you, Our subjects, that we may all thus attain to the same virtue."

Copies of this Rescript were sent to the schools; and it became the custom for teachers and pupils to come together on certain national holidays to listen to its reading. It is taken in the most reverential way from the box in which it is kept, slowly unrolled, and read to the members of the school, who stand with bowed heads as they listen to the august words of their Emperor. The slightest lack of decorum is looked upon as almost treasonable.

To most foreigners the esteem in which the Rescript is held will seem strange, and they may not see how it could affect the progress of Christianity. It was, however, seized upon by the reactionists, who declared that it was intended by the Emperor as a direct blow against the ethics and the religion of the West. Many commentaries upon the Rescript were written in which it was repeatedly asserted that Western nations knew little of the true principles of loyalty and filial piety, while many of the teachings of Christianity were opposed to what the Emperor had urged upon his people. To such attacks the Christians were quick to reply; insisting that they gladly assented to all that the Rescript contained, and that its teachings were in accord with their own religion. Indeed, some Christians in excess of zeal spoke of the Rescript as though it were to be put on a par with the Bible.

About this time the custom was introduced of having the pupils in the public schools bow on certain national holidays before the picture of the Emperor, So much honour was paid to the picture that instances are recorded where janitors or teachers lost their lives in trying to save it from burning buildings. It seemed as though an attempt was being made to foster the idea that the Emperor was to be considered divine. Zealous patriots were on the watch to detect any act that might savour of disrespect. On one occasion after the ceremony of bowing to the portrait had been performed, the teacher of a school said: "You may now put away His Majesty's picture." The expression was thought lacking in reverence and the teacher was dismissed. In another town an official who visited a school did not remove his shoes before entering the building. A student afterwards spoke of this as a violation of the rules of the school. The teacher, in trying to show that all rules have exceptions, said: "Surely, if the Emperor should come, you would not expect him to leave his shoes outside." At once this was declared insulting, since the Emperor had been spoken of as though he were a mere man; and the teacher lost his position. A Christian teacher in one of the higher schools in Tokyo declared that he could not bow before the Emperor's picture, since to do so was an act of worship. At once there was a great stir throughout the whole land. The affair was discussed by all the newspapers, and by many was declared to be a proof of the disloyalty of the Christians. The latter with few exceptions met the charge by saying that they did not regard the act of bowing as worship, but as reverent salutation of a sovereign whom they all honoured. One good result of the agitation was that the Department of Education changed the word used of the ceremony so as to make it evident that no worship was involved. Public opinion, however, made it necessary for the professor that had caused the excitement to hand in his resignation. About the same time, there were a few cases where Christian teachers were dismissed, nominally for other reasons, but really, as was generally supposed, because of their religion.

The first election of members of parliament occurred in 1890. Among the candidates were several Christians, and it is not strange that their religion cost them many votes. In some places the Buddhists put forth the most strenuous efforts to prevent their election, Mr. Kataoka Kenkichi, an elder of the Kochi Presbyterian Church, was a prominent candidate. Some of his political friends came to him, saying:

"You would certainly be elected were it not for your religion, but that makes the result doubtful. We will not urge you to give up Christianity, but it will help matters if we can announce that you have resigned your office in the Church. Withdraw from the eldership, at least for the time being. After election, if you wish to resume the office, you can do so."

To this appeal Mr. Kataoka simply replied: "I will do no such thing. I would rather be an elder in the Church than a member of parliament."

His steadfastness did not turn to his disadvantage. At this and many subsequent elections he was chosen a member of the House of Representatives, and for several sessions was its Speaker.

Similar consistency was shown by Rev. Honda Yoitsu, who, before removing to Sendai in order to become the pastor of the Methodist Church in that city, had for several years been a member of the legislature of his native prefecture. In 1890 he was urged to become a candidate for parliament and could doubtless have gained the election were it not that religious teachers were by law debarred from serving as representatives. Many of his friends urged him to withdraw from the ministry. He himself says that it was a great temptation over which he long thought and prayed, the result being that he continued in the ministry.

As a result of the elections, thirteen out of the three hundred members of the House of Representatives were Christians—nearly nine times the proportion that Christians had in the total population—a result the more noteworthy since their religion could have gained them but few votes, while it had caused them to lose many. This one fact is a sufficient refutal of the assertion that Christianity had made no progress except among the lowest and most ignorant classes. To the Buddhists of Kyoto it was a cause of great chagrin that a Christian was elected from that part of the city most under their control, where the powerful Shin sect had put forth great exertions to prevent such a humiliation. It may be further mentioned that when the first House of Representatives chose its officers, the Speaker \(Nakashima Nobuyuki\) and the. Chairman of the Committee of the Whole \(Shimada Sahuro\) were professing Christians.

One reason for the political preferment of the Christians was doubtless that their fellow-citizens had learned that they were upright and trustworthy men, to whom the public interests could be safely committed. Some of them had also been prominent in advocating reforms that met the approval of the people. It has been suggested that another reason may have been that in considering various subjects that came before the churches for discussion these men had gained an experience that afterwards helped them to perform successfully their duties in the local assemblies, where most of them served an apprenticeship before being chosen for the higher position.

A movement, partly political, in which Christians had been the acknowledged leaders, was that for the abolition of licensed prostitution. In the large cities of Japan were certain quarters occupied by houses of ill-fame. These were licensed by the Government. The inmates were practically slaves; most of them having been delivered over to the masters for a term of years by their own fathers, or, in case the father was not living, by whatever person might be at the head of the family. The law required that the girl's consent should be gained; but such are the ideas of filial obedience prevailing in Japan that few girls would venture to oppose the father's will, and common opinion would condemn any who should be so daring. Those who once entered the life of shame found it almost impossible to escape, their wily masters managing to involve them in debts that bound them to continual service. It is not necessary here to enter into the arguments of those who favoured the method by which the Government attempted to regulate prostitution. Suffice it to say that the Christians started an agitation against the licensing system, endeavouring at first to get prefectural assemblies to abolish it. This agitation first attracted attention in Gumma Prefecture, where the President and several members of the assembly were Christians, and where Christianity had gained such a foothold that it exercised considerable influence over public opinion. A vote for the abolition of legalised prostitution was soon gained. The movement spread to other parts of the country. Everywhere the Christians were regarded as its natural leaders, though they were earnestly supported by others who desired the moral elevation of their country. Lectures were delivered, pamphlets were issued, and newspapers were utilised so far as these dared to disregard the threats of the powerful class whose business was in danger. In Kyoto a Christian who led in the agitation was assaulted at the instigation of the brothel-keepers. Though rescued before receiving serious injury, the danger of other attacks was considered so serious that the police insisted on having one of their number accompany him wherever he went. In a few provinces the desired vote for abolition was obtained. The Christians felt so much encouraged over these successes that they decided to go one step further. They began to circulate petitions asking that the new parliament prohibit prefectures from giving licenses. Success did not follow this appeal. Moreover, the weakening of zeal, caused in part by the chill that came over the churches because of the reactionary movements and theological discussions of ensuing years, led to a discontinuance of the agitation. The brothel-keepers of some prefectures rallied their forces so as to secure a repeal of the vote for prohibition. In Gumma Prefecture, however, their efforts and wily schemes failed to secure the restoration of the old system.

The desire of the Buddhists to oppose Christianity led them to become in some places the allies of those engaged in pandering to lust. This was especially the case in Nagoya, a stronghold of Buddhism and also of immorality. The chapels and the houses of the missionaries were stoned. The missionaries were obliged to live with blankets and rugs hung over the windows to keep out the stones, such as had already broken the glass and shutters. When Dr. Perin, of the Universalis\! Mission, attempted to hold a meeting in a theatre, he narrowly escaped serious injury from the turbulent mob.

In the province of Ise, mobs broke up meetings and injured chapels, though here the disturbance was not directly connected with the movement for the abolition of licensed vice. The most serious trouble was in the town of Yamada, the seat of the great Shinto shrines. The chief business of the town is connected with the entertainment of pilgrims. Incongruous as it may appear, this place, like the vicinity of most other noted temples, whether Buddhist or Shinto, was a hot-bed of immorality; those that came nominally for worship indulging at the same time in debauchery. Societies were organised for driving Christianity out of the place, meetings were broken up, and soon none dared to confess any interest in the hated religion.

The work of the Church Missionary Society in Tokushima \(Shikoku\) was hindered for a while by a "Buddhist Young Men's Club" that was the centre of an organised effort to oppose Christianity, The missionary's house was injured and believers were molested. The trials strengthened the faith of the Christians, and among the persons baptised the next year was a Buddhist priest.

Increased denominational variety was given by the coming of the mission sent by the Universalist General Convention of America, The first missionaries reached Japan in April, 1890, and under the leadership of Rev. George L. Perin soon erected a building to serve as a permanent centre for their work. A theological seminary and an English school were opened, and soon afterward a magazine was published.

Another addition to the missionary force was made in the autumn of the same year by a band of men and women under the leadership of Rev. Barclay F. Buxton, who undertook the responsibility for their maintenance. They worked under the auspices of the Church Missionary Society, making Matsue, in the province of Izumo, their headquarters. Mr. Buxton was also frequently called to other parts of the country for evangelistic services among churches of different denominations. An earnest believer in certain doctrines concerning "holiness," he did much to propagate them among both Japanese and foreigners.

The missionaries connected with the Church Missionary Society enlarged their educational work in Osaka by the erection of a building for what was thenceforth known as the Bishop Poole Memorial Girls' School, and also by opening a school for boys, which in January of the next year removed to a new building on the outskirts of the city, the location giving it the name "Momoyama Gakuin."

Previous to the year 1890, the National Bible Society of Scotland, the British and Foreign Bible Society, and the American Bible Society had maintained separate agencies that for the most part worked independently. An arrangement was now made by which these agencies were combined, thus avoiding the rivalry and waste resulting from the former system. About the same time a similar arrangement united the agencies of the American Tract Society and the London Religious Tract Society, their work being put under the care of "The Tract Societies' Committee" composed of American and British missionaries.

In December, 1890, the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\) held a synod in which it was decided to adopt as its Declaration of Faith the Apostles' Creed, with the following Preamble:

"The Lord Jesus Christ, whom we worship as God, the only begotten Son of God, for us men and for our salvation, was made man and suffered. He offered up a perfect sacrifice for sin; and all who are one with Him by faith are pardoned and accounted righteous; and faith in Him working by love purifies the heart.

"The Holy Ghost, who with the Father and Son is worshipped and glorified, reveals Jesus Christ to the soul; and without His grace man being dead in sin cannot enter the kingdom of God. By Him the prophets and holy men of old were inspired; and He speaking in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments is the supreme and infallible Judge in all things pertaining unto faith and living.

"From these Holy Scriptures the ancient Church of Christ drew its Confession; and we holding the faith once delivered to the saints join in that confession with praise and thanksgiving:

"I believe in the Father Almighty, etc."

The Council of Missions working in connection with the above church issued the following statement of the views that had led the Synod to adopt this Confession;

"Characteristics necessary to a Confession for the Church of Christ in Japan in this era of its history;—

"1. It should be simple and brief. Men are constantly asking: 'What are the doctrines of your Church?' They will not read a long document in reply.

"2. It should be a Confession about which the whole Church will rally, a Confession for pastor and people alike.

"3. It should be irenic. The church in Japan is face to face with Buddhism, Confucianism, Agnosticism, Rationalism, and radical Unitarianism. Its Confessions of Faith should proclaim the whole difference between these things and Christ. It should set forth the great truths of historical Christianity. But it should not be a symbol of division among those who love and worship one Lord Jesus Christ."

It is fitting that some notice should be taken of the work that was being done for the Japanese residing in California, and an article published in *The Church,* July, 1890, gives an account of its condition at that time. The number of Japanese then living in San Francisco was about two thousand, while from a thousand to fifteen hundred more were in the vicinity. A few years earlier, many young men had gone to California for study, supposing that they could easily gain admittance to the best schools and get an education at a very small expense. Some of these soon found it necessary to exchange study for work. Later comers were merchants, clerks, and labourers. Not only did individual churches endeavour to reach these people, but there were special movements in their behalf. That of the Methodists began about 1880, in connection with the Mission for the Chinese, and in 1886 was organised as a separate mission under the superintendence of Rev. M. C. Harris, D.D., who had been obliged, on account of Mrs. Harris's poor health, to give up missionary labour in Japan itself.\* Dr, Harris's earnest efforts in behalf of the Japanese in California were in 1898 recognised by the Japanese Government, which conferred on him the decoration of the Fourth Degree of the Imperial Order of the Sacred Treasure.

In 1890 the Christian societies of Japanese in San Francisco were the following:

I. The Gospel Society, connected with the Methodist Church, and numbering one hundred and fifteen young men.

2. The Japanese Ladies' Benevolent Society, also connected with the Methodist Church, whose object was to relieve the sick and destitute, to distribute clothing, to find employment for Japanese women, and otherwise to assist them when in need.

3. The Japanese Young Men's Christian Association, connected with the Presbyterian Church and having ninety-five members.

4. The Only Friend Society, made up of about a dozen young men who were members of Kumi-ai Churches in Japan.

5. The Japanese Christian Union, composed of twenty-one persons of different denominations, who desired to become preachers of the Gospel.

There were two organised churches; one Methodist and the other Presbyterian. Several other churches in the city had Japanese among their members.

As time went on, the number of Japanese on the Pacific Coast and in other parts of America increased. Efforts for their evangelisation were made in many places, and some churches were organised.

Bishop Williams of the American Episcopal Mission had withdrawn in 1889 from Episcopal cares, and the office remained unfilled for four years. During a part of this time Bishop Hare of South Dakota superintended the affairs of the Mission, arriving in Japan in the spring of 1891. He soon afterwards joined with Bishop Bickersteth in proposing a plan for defining the respective jurisdictions of the English and American bishops. It was to be considered only a temporary arrangement, since "the English and American bishops are not regarded by the Japanese and should not be regarded by us as having jurisdiction over dioceses finally delimited, but rather as forerunners in the Episcopate of Japanese bishops who will exercise jurisdiction over such permanently defined dioceses as the expansion of the Japanese Church may in the future demand." The negotiations over this matter occupied considerable time, but in 1894 Japan was divided into six dioceses:—Hokkaido, North Tokyo, South Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Kyushu.

At their annual meeting in 1891, the Kumi-ai Churches adopted a basis of organisation. While each church retained its independence, delegates were to meet in a general and in local associations for consultation on matters of common interest. A statement of the faith of the churches was prepared, not as a creed to which conformity was demanded, but as a declaration of beliefs held in common. As slightly modified by the committee to which it was entrusted, it took the following form in which it was adopted the next year:

"We believe in one God, infinite, perfect, who is made known in the Bible as Holy Father, Holy Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe in Jesus Christ, who, being God, became man; who suffered and died and rose again that He might save sinners. We believe in the Holy Spirit, who bestows the new life. We believe in the Bible, which was given by the inspiration of God and makes us wise unto salvation. We believe in the Holy Church, baptism by water, the Lord's Supper, the Holy Lord's Day, eternal life, the resurrection of the dead, and in just rewards and punishments."

In October, 1891, a terrible earthquake that had its centre near the cities of Gifu and Ogaki, resulted in the loss of eight thousand lives, the wounding of fifteen thousand persons, and the complete or partial destruction of more than one hundred thousand houses. The missionaries living in Gifu and Nagoya at once exerted themselves to help the suffering. As soon as the news reached other parts of the country, the Christians organised plans for relief. Such organised effort was new in Japan, and the example was quickly followed by the Buddhists. Almost the first, if not the very first, medical relief to reach the scene of disaster from outside was a corps of physicians and nurses led by Dr. Berry from the Doshisha Hospital in Kyoto, The foreigners in the open ports contributed about thirty-five thousand *yen* and sent committees to superintend the use of this fund. The help thus rendered by foreigners and by Christians did much to change the general sentiment of a district that had been strongly prejudiced against both. One person engaged in the work said: "In their gratitude the people worshipped us daily," and this was doubtless literally true. The Christian orphanages received many of the children that were left without parents, and new asylums were Opened for such persons and for others who had been made destitute. It was the first time that Christian charity had been displayed upon a large scale; and though the Buddhists are also to be commended for their activity, it was generally recognised that the Christians had acted more promptly and that their charity was more wisely administered.

It will be remembered that a company of young men commonly known as the "Kumamoto Band" had in spite of severe persecution entered into solemn covenant with each other that they would follow Jesus Christ and devote their lives to teaching His Gospel to their countrymen. They had been among the most prominent ministers of the Kumi-ai body and by their earnest labours had built up several churches. One of the most successful was Mr. Kanamori who, after a few years in Okayama and a short period of service as a teacher in the Doshisha, had become pastor of a church in Tokyo. His views upon some of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity underwent such a change that he resigned from the pastorate. Soon after this he published a book entitled" The Present and Future of Christianity in Japan." As described by another pastor: "This book stripped Christianity of its supernatural ism. It denied miracles, the divinity of Christ, and the atonement." This defection was perhaps the severest blow that the Protestant churches had yet received. At the time, none of the other leading preachers were ready to assent to his views, but his prominence brought before the Christians at large doctrines of which they before possessed but little knowledge. The book was, however, more a symptom of theological uneasiness than it was a promoting cause. Many of the preachers and educated laymen were readers of Western periodicals, and the unrest existing in Europe could not but find an echo in Japan. In that country the results were the more deplorable because the Church had not reached a stage where it was prepared to discuss such questions as now perplexed it. Men who from childhood have been steeped in Christian thought can indulge in intellectual speculations with much less danger than those who have just come out from non-Christian systems of belief, and who are likely to lose all their faith if any part of it is seriously shaken.

After the opening of Japan proper to the Gospel, the Loochoo Islands were for a long time neglected by Protestants. Rev. J. C. Davison of the American Methodist Mission, spent five days there in 1887, and preached in Napha to a small company of Japanese and Loochoo-ans, A lady from Scotland had long desired to see the Gospel given to the islanders, and after a visit to Japan she offered to the American Baptist Union a sum of money sufficient to provide what would be needed for the first years of evangelistic effort. The offer having been accepted, two Japanese evangelists were sent in the autumn of 1891. Not long afterward, Mr, Correll of the American Methodist Mission, visited the islands, where in December he baptised the first convert. Both the Baptists and Methodists have continued their work; and in 1893 the Church Missionary Society also stationed an evangelist there.

Official interference with Christian work increased. In one city where several military men had been brought into the church or into Christian clubs, officers of the grade of captain and lieutenants were told by superiors that they must stop trying to introduce Christianity into the ranks. In the Judicial Department men were told that the profession of Christianity was the only thing standing in the way of their promotion. It was also believed that the real cause for the discharge of certain teachers was their religion. The Christians desired to find some test case where the facts were sufficiently plain to justify an appeal. At last they considered that such a case had been found in Kumamoto, where in 1891 several events occurred that gave rise to much controversy in the newspapers. Some of the most prominent Christian ministers were chosen to bring the matter before the Government and the public. In an open letter that was published in several papers they stated that the prefectural Governor had said in an address to the leading officials of towns and villages:

"There are two things that are forbidden to teachers of primary schools. One is the belonging to any political party or to any society formed for political purposes. The other is the acceptance of Christianity. That is a foreign religion and is not to be believed. Teachers must strictly follow the Emperor's Rescript. In case a teacher accepts Christianity, he will be summarily dealt with."

It was alleged that a month later, when the principal of a primary school was informed by the police that four pupils were studying the Bible, he reprimanded them and threatened to expel them unless they desisted. One of them, who refused to obey, was expelled as a disorderly student. The committee of the Christians said:

"These evils are not limited to one prefecture. All through the country similar things are done. Even the editors of educational papers and of journals at the very foot of the Imperial Throne are, with strange ingenuity and recklessness, upholding such actions as being in harmony with the Constitution. In case it is decided that a believer in Christianity cannot attend the common schools, then it follows that the position of teacher is taken from Christians as well as the privileges of the schools from their children."

The Governor's secretary in a reply to this open letter declared that the speech in question had been incorrectly reported and that there was no official knowledge of the expulsion of a student for the alleged reason.

The committee had an interview with the Ministers of Education and of Home Affairs. The former said:

"Since it is the aim of the Department to teach morality on the basis of the Emperor's Rescript, any attempt on the part of teachers, while engaged in their official duties, to obstruct this aim will be met with a dismissal from service. . . . But so far as religion is concerned, it is outside the control of the Educational Office, and beyond all question is left entirely to the free will of any and every individual. This Department has nothing to do with a teacher's belief in Buddhism, Christianity, or in no religion at all."

When reminded that the *Educational Journal,* which was supposed to represent the views of the Department, had supported the alleged action of the Governor and the principal of the school, the Minister declared that the Department had no connection with the magazine. The reply of the other minister was similar, and as both gave permission to have their words published, the position of the Christians regarding religious liberty was greatly strengthened.

There began to be, especially among the Kumi-ai Churches, considerable discussion upon the subject of complete independence from the missions. With what was said concerning the desirability of the churches becoming self-supporting most of the missionaries could sympathise, since it was what they themselves had urged. Unfortunately, however, the agitation was connected at this time with ill-feeling towards the missionaries, who were charged with endeavouring to exert too much control over the churches. Somewhat strangely, the severest criticisms came from those whose relations were with a mission that disclaimed all authority over the churches, leaving them to make their own creeds, to choose their own forms of government, and to manage their own finances; the missionaries retaining only the right to decide on their own methods of work and on the use that should be made of funds entrusted to their care. Some of the more radical agitators desired that missionary funds used in aiding schools and evangelistic work should be given as lump sums wholly into the care of the Japanese. Others wished that the missionaries should have such a connection with the churches that their location and forms of work should be decided by the latter. In some quarters it was urged that missionaries ought to leave to the Japanese ministry the work in the older fields, while they themselves should go, as one of the pastors said, "into the interior and even to the Loochoo Islands." Criticisms of the missionaries were rife. Many of these were doubtless well-founded; but the manner in which they were made, sometimes even before audiences of unbelievers, did much to grieve the hearts and lessen the influence of even the most devoted foreign workers. To some extent, the agitation was an outgrowth of the ultra-nationalism that, in order to exalt everything Japanese, thought it necessary to depreciate whatever was done by foreigners. Not all, however, joined in the adverse criticism; and though at times any marked expression of esteem for missionaries subjected a person to the accusation of being their slave, many still prized their work and sought the co-operation of those who had been their first teachers.

Mention should be made of three persons that visited Japan in 1892. Dr. G. T. Ladd, Professor of Philosophy in Yale University, came to deliver a course of lectures in the Doshisha. He also addressed the students of the Imperial University in Tokyo, and spoke before the Young Men's Christian Associations at their summer school. His lectures on the relation of philosophy to religion were well received and exerted considerable influence. So good was the impression made upon Japanese scholars that Professor Ladd has since then made two visits to Japan in order to deliver lectures in the Imperial University.

Miss Mary A. West came to labour in behalf of temperance. She visited many cities, doing much to establish new total abstinence societies and to inspire the old ones with fresh enthusiasm. While in Kanazawa she fell ill and died. At her funeral in Tokyo many prominent officials and citizens united in showing honour to one who had lost her life in seeking the good of Japan.

Rev. F. E. Clark, D.D., the founder and President of the Christian Endeavour Society, was the third of these visitors. A few Endeavour Societies had previously been established in Japan, and now as a result of his addresses several new ones were formed.

A missionary who had the reputation of usually looking on the bright side wrote concerning the year 1893:

"As for organised Christianity, it has been a hard, discouraging year. There are those who would not say so; but they cannot alter the fact that the churches are poorly attended, many a pastor or evangelist having hardly fifty for an audience, while the self-supporting churches find it harder and harder to be self-supporting with audiences that fail to increase. There are baptisms every month, perhaps a hundred and fifty on the average among all the Protestant churches, yet so many are students, teachers, or officials, who move from one place to another, that the churches are not generally growing stronger. With all this, there is something of friction between the missionaries and the native Christians, though that is by no means universal."\*

Early in the year a very severe attack was made upon Christianity by Professor Inoue Tetsujiro of the Imperial University, He wrote an article that appeared simultaneously in six Buddhist and one Unitarian magazine. For a while it became the subject of controversy in all religious periodicals and to some extent in the secular papers. It was hailed with the greatest joy by Buddhists, and the ablest Christian writers busied themselves in replying to its charges. The following extracts from a synopsis given in the *Japan Mail* will show the spirit of the article:

"At the issuance of the Imperial Rescript, only Christians were opposed to it. Buddhists, Confucianists, and Shintoists accepted it. The Christians made defence that they did not oppose the Rescript, but only its worship. This, however, was a mere pretence. Christians do not like the meaning of the Imperial words; they oppose loyalty and filial obedience, the ancient principles of ethics in Japan. Why? Some Christians are of course loyal and teach the Rescript in their churches, but they are not supported by the conservative faithful. Christians are divided into two classes; one class seeking to preserve their doctrine, which is hostile to Japan, the other trying to Japanise their Christianity in spite of the impossibility of doing so. In a word, Christianity is not adaptable to Japan. If it were, why should it be necessary to try to adapt it to the country?. . . Christians do not worship any other than their one only God, Monotheism is like an absolute monarchy. It denies all other gods but its one. Polytheism is like a confederation of states; toleration of one with another prevails. Buddhism, which is polytheistic, has therefore had a warm and gentle history, but the history of Christianity has been intolerant and warlike. . . In Shinto also there are many gods; all Emperors are regarded as divine. Japanese ethics are the teachings left by the Emperors. Our nationality rests on this foundation. . . . Worship of the Emperor's words is nothing difficult to a patriot. Christians have lost their patriotism unconsciously. They wonder at the patriotic devotion of others. They antagonise the present moral passion, and will violate the order and destroy the unity of the country. . . . The essence of the Imperial Rescript and Christianity are different. If the former is to guide national education, Christians must oppose it. If there are Christians who accept it, they either simply acquiesce and wait, or, if sincere, they have changed their relation to Christianity. The two powers, the Rescript and Christianity are not in harmony."

Professor Inoue adduced several instances where Japanese Christians were alleged to have shown disrespect to the Rescript or to the Emperor's picture. By quotations from Christ's words and by references to European history he endeavoured to show that Christianity is destructive of patriotism. He closed by asserting that as Christ Himself had said, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation," therefore the reception of Christianity would involve national destruction.

It will be seen that this attack, like those of twenty-five years before, was based upon the idea that Christianity is opposed to the principles of loyalty and filial piety. The replies of the Christians contained indignant denials that they were lacking in love for country and Emperor, or in readiness to follow the moral teaching laid down in the Rescript. Doubtless the charge laid against them led them to be more earnest in displaying their patriotism, and the morbid nationalism thus fostered increased the friction between them and the foreign missionaries.

Some of the missions had considerable trouble connected with holding property in the interior, Japanese law did not permit foreigners to be the legal owners of real estate. In some places it was difficult to rent suitable houses, and so land had been bought by the missionaries and buildings erected for residences, chapels, or schools. The real estate was necessarily registered in the name of some Japanese. Other foreigners besides the missionaries followed the same plan, and in the case of foreigners employed by the Government this was done by the assistance of the officials, so that the whole arrangement was open and perfectly understood. In connection with the morbid nationalism of the time, there suddenly arose the cry that foreigners were trying to buy up the best land in the country, and those who had consented to take the nominal ownership of the property for which the foreigners paid the money were condemned as traitors. Even some of the Christians began to say that those who held land for the missionaries were breakers of the law and that the missionaries themselves were parties to the crime. In a few cases the persons in whose name the property was registered mortgaged or sold it, retaining the money for themselves, and there was no legal redress. Some Christian schools built by the Japanese suffered in the same way, since the lack of trust laws made it necessary to have the property held in the names of individuals.

Mention has been made of Nagoya as a city where Buddhism possessed much strength, and where its followers exerted themselves to oppose Christianity. Several incidents occurring in 1893 showed the bitterness of their hatred. In May the meeting of the Japanese Evangelical Alliance was held in that city. It was at that time the custom among politicians to hire a class of men called *soshi,* who not only protected their employers from assault, but also did their best to break up the meetings of the other party. The Buddhists of Nagoya now resorted to similar methods. To a large public meeting of the Alliance held in the evening they sent a company of about forty *soshi,* who divided into two bands, one remaining outside of the Methodist Church where the meeting was held, and the other entering the building. Soon they began an antiphonal chorus of yells, one group answering to the other. Ere long, stones and other missiles were thrown. In anticipation of trouble several policemen, some of them in citizen's clothing, were in attendance, but found it difficult to restore order. Some of those that were without uniforms had their clothes torn and they themselves were wounded. The Alliance had planned to invite the officials, teachers, and prominent citizens of the city to a social gathering; but the Buddhists went to the proprietor of the building that had been engaged for the purpose and threatened to tear it down if he permitted it to be used. The same course was pursued with the proprietor of another building where the Christian ladies of Nagoya had arranged a reception for the delegates. In both cases the owners withdrew their consent for the meetings.

In October a new chapel was dedicated by the Methodists of Nagoya. At an evangelical service that followed, the Buddhists, who had come in large numbers, rose at a given signal, smashed all the lamps, scattering the oil over the worshippers, tore the clock from the wall, and broke the windows. The Methodists had also rented a house for a chapel in another part of the city. The Buddhists went to the owner and protested against his letting the building for such a purpose. As he insisted that the clause of the Constitution insuring religious liberty gave him the right to let his house to Christians, a meeting was held in a temple to which he was called in order that he might be assailed with arguments and threats. Next, a building opposite the one in question was secured for an indignation meeting. *Soshi* were sent with clubs to invade the man's house, and he was forced to flee for refuge to some friends in the country. The Buddhists then induced the wife's family to say that they would compel her to leave him unless he repented. They at last accomplished what they desired; for when the man came with tears to the missionaries, threw down the money already paid, and begged to be released from the contract, it did not seem best to insist on holding him to his former promise.

A great advance was made in the Church Missionary Society's work among the Ainu. In 1893 there was an increase from eleven church-members "and two catechumens to two hundred and nineteen members and one hundred and fifty-one catechumens. The number of villages containing Christians increased from two to ten. Of one village Mr, Batchelor wrote:

"Every woman in Piratori has accepted Christ as her Saviour, That is a glorious triumph of the Cross, for the women hitherto have never been allowed to have any religion; the men only have worshipped God. Just think of old women over seventy years of age, now for the first time in their lives, praying—and praying to Jesus only\!"

A Methodist missionary who visited Hakodate in January, 1903, wrote of the harmony that existed among different denominations in that city. He said:

"It is customary here in Hakodate for the Christians, not only to unite during the week in prayer, but also on the second Sunday of the Week of Prayer, and partake of the Lord's Supper together. One year the Lord's Supper is observed according to the Episcopal form, the next according to the Presbyterian, and the next according to the Methodist. . . . These Sunday 'Union' services are always held in the Methodist Church, because that church building is the largest. . . . I was invited to preach the sermon. . . After the sermon Mr. A., a missionary of the Church of England \(a Low Churchman\), conducted and administered the Holy Communion, wearing his surplice. He read the service in Japanese according to the order of his Church, inviting the pastors of the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches \(both Japanese\) and myself within the railing around the pulpit. After partaking of the emblems himself, he administered them first to us three, and then invited us to assist him in administering to the people as they gathered about the railing."\*

Among other signs of progress in 1893 may be mentioned the completion of the revised Episcopal Prayer Book, the holding of a summer school for girls, and the establishment of the Railway Mission. This last placed a copy of the New Testament in each railway station, and published a monthly paper for the benefit of railway men.

About this time the question began to be discussed among some of the missions whether it was advisable to ask for more workers from abroad. Some pointed to the many towns and villages whose inhabitants had as yet heard nothing of Christ, and asserted that until these had been reached there was need of more missionaries. Those that doubted the advisability of asking for re-enforcements were chiefly influenced by two considerations. It seemed to them that the responsibility for evangelising the country should be thrown largely upon the Japanese Christians themselves, the churches having already gained such a degree of strength as should enable them to carry on the work with the help of the foreign missionaries already on the field; and that, while many other countries were inadequately supplied with missionaries, men and women should not be urged to come to Japan except to meet special needs or to supply vacancies caused by death or removal. Some too, felt that in the present state of public opinion a marked increase in the number of foreign workers would prove irritating even to the Christians, many of whom complained that the missionaries were trying to keep things too much under their own control, and said that the money required for supporting one foreigner could be more advantageously used in employing several Japanese workers. To some missions it seemed preferable to leave the question of re-enforcements in abeyance, waiting for further developments before deciding whether to ask for new missionaries.

In view of the persecution to which the Christians of Nagoya had been subjected, it is gratifying to know of the blessings that came to them in the beginning of the year 1894. The different churches united in observing the annual Week of Prayer. The meetings were well attended, and as they drew near the close the interest was so great that it was decided to continue them. The faith of believers was quickened, and those that had grown cold confessed their sins. The awakening was such as had never before been known in that part of Japan, and the Christians were spurred to more earnest labour for unbelievers. Daily evangelistic services were begun in different parts of the city. Persons were chosen to convey to churches in other cities an account of this revival in the hope that the intelligence might lead them to seek and obtain similar blessings. One of the Christian newspapers reported that, as a reaction from the low state that had prevailed for several years, there were revivals in all parts of the country; those in Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagoya being the most noteworthy.

There continued to be in several places violent opposition to Christianity. In Saga, Buddhist students endeavoured to break up meetings that were inaugurated by the Evangelical Lutheran Mission. They used all sorts of insulting epithets, and tried to drown the voice of the speakers. Finally a mob gathered in front of the chapel, tore down the fence, threw stones, rushed into the building, and behaved so violently that several policemen were required to quell the disturbance. In Yonezawa, while an open-air meeting was being held, a stone thrown at Miss Imhof, who had gone to play the organ, broke her spectacles, and pieces of the glass entered one eye so that she lost its use. It should be said that the prefectural Governor and other officials called in person upon Miss Imhof or sent messages to express their regret for what had happened.

In March, 1894, the Unitarians dedicated in Tokyo a two-story building to which the name Unity Hall was given. It contained an audience room, a library, and rooms for the use of a school. An extract from the dedicatory address of Rev. Clay MacCauley, D.D., will show the importance that he attached to the building:

"If, in beginning what I have to say, I should assert that in the modern history of Japan no event of more importance than this has taken place, most of those who hear me would think my words the extreme of absurdity and pretension. But, in a deep sense, this assertion is neither absurd nor pretentious. Let me say why. The purpose with which Unity Hall is to be made a gift to the Japanese people is this. Here we intend to give a home to a school of learning in which the highest human relations, those which are manifested in religion, morals, and social order, may not only be studied, but be also understood clearly and unquestionably; and further that from here the result of such study may be made practical in life. Here religion, morals, and social order are to be subjected to the same methods of investigation as those which characterise all objects of the science and philosophy of the present age. Here no tradition as such will control our work. Here, so far as possible, our high studies have been freed from prejudice."\*

The outbreak of the war with China made the year 1894 an important one in Japan's history. This war affected in many ways the progress of Christianity. In the first place, the Christians had an opportunity to disprove the charge that had so persistently been brought against them of being deficient in loyalty. Those in the army were eager to prove their devotion to their country, and some of the most noteworthy deeds of personal valour were performed by them. An "interdenominational society was formed through which money was raised and supplies contributed to furnish comforts for the soldiers.

The war opened a way for carrying the Gospel into the army. It will be remembered that soldiers had often been warned not to attend Christian services nor to read Christian books. Even so late as the spring of 1894, a prince of the blood, who was in command of a garrison, gave what was practically an order that Christian soldiers must give up their religion. In a branch of this garrison, about a dozen of the common soldiers and a few officers formed an important part of the church in the city where they were stationed. The privates decided that it would be necessary for them to conform outwardly to the command, and asked to have their names erased from the register of the church. Some of the officers felt obliged to take the same course. Now, however, a great change came. Rev, H. Loomis, the agent of the Bible Societies, obtained from the Vice-Minister of War permission to visit all the garrisons in Japan in order to supply the men with copies of the Gospels. Letters were sent to the commanding officers instructing them to give Mr, Loomis the necessary assistance for distributing the books. In some places regiments were drawn up in line that they might be addressed by a missionary before the books were given out. In other places the officers received the books and themselves distributed them to the men. A similar work was done in the navy. The Scriptures and other Christian literature were distributed to soldiers in the hospitals and even to the Chinese prisoners that were sent to Japan. In nearly every case the books were thankfully received, and many of the officers wrote letters expressing their appreciation of what had been done. Prince Komatsu, who was next in command to the Emperor, expressed in person his gratitude to Mr. Loomis.

Five prominent Japanese ministers went to the seat of war as chaplains. They were sent by the Christians, but were recognised by the military authorities, so that they had their quarters with the army. When they were to deliver addresses, the officers usually gave out notices of the meetings and came themselves with the men. In addition to direct religious work, the chaplains, whose official designation signified "comforters," tried in various ways to cheer the men by sympathetic ministrations to their welfare. Occasionally they came in contact with Chinese Christians. Notwithstanding the difference in language, they could communicate with these in writing. One of the chaplains says of a prayer-meeting held with the Chinese: "Though we could not talk together, the tunes of the hymns we sang, the name of Christ, and the word 'Amen' were equally familiar to all."

Plans were made for sending two American missionaries to engage in similar work, and there is good reason to believe that the consent of the military authorities would have been gained had it not been that the American Minister refused to forward the request that must of necessity pass through his hands.

During the war the city of Hiroshima was the military headquarters, and it also became the centre for much Christian work among the soldiers that spent a longer or shorter time in the city on their way to or from the seat of war. The most favourable opportunity for work was among the sick and wounded soldiers in the hospitals. Missionaries joined with Japanese Christians in carrying books, papers, pictures, flowers, and other things to the patients, who were glad for anything that would relieve the monotony of the hours. Those in charge of the hospitals welcomed such ministrations and gave the missionary ladies freedom to visit all parts of the hospitals and to converse with the patients. Some of the hospitals were under the care of the Red Cross Society, This had become very popular in Japan. Most of the prominent citizens of the country were members, and a large force of nurses had received training under its auspices. Though not a Christian society, its symbol was significant of the fact that its principles of charity to be shown to friend and foe alike had come from the teaching of Him who had died upon the Cross. When it was remembered that not many years before the Japanese had trampled upon the cross as the sign of a hated religion, it was very suggestive to see it now becoming an honoured symbol. In the long wards of the hospitals, the cross was everywhere to be seen,— on the sleeves of the surgeons, on the white caps of the nurses, on the clothes worn by the patients themselves. One of the missionary ladies said: "How could we keep from speaking of our Saviour when the Cross was ever before our eyes? What better introduction to religious conversation could there be than to ask the sick soldier if he knew the original meaning of the symbol he was wearing on his arm?" Yet it was necessary to take care not to weary the patients nor to press the subject of Christianity unduly. The missionary ladies by their helpfulness and wisdom so commended themselves to the persons in charge that they were allowed to visit the wards at hours in which even relatives were denied admittance.

By the treaty of peace that concluded the war Formosa and the Pescadores were ceded to Japan. This brought into its territory a number of churches and Christians, the fruits of work done by the Canadian and the English Presbyterian Missions. The scope of this history does not require an account of these missions among the Formosans, though mention may be made of the fellowship that Christians in the Japanese army, and afterward, those in official positions had with their fellow-believers who had now become their fellow-countrymen. Efforts were also put forth, especially by the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\), for the religious welfare of the Japanese settled in Formosa.

In 1894 the Church of Christ in Japan took a step in the line of financial independence by a reorganisation of its Board of Missions. For some years before this the Co-operating Missions had given three *yen* for every one contributed by the churches, and the Board had been composed in equal numbers of missionaries and Japanese. According to the new plan, the subsidies of the Missions were relinquished and a Board consisting of twenty members was elected by the Synod. This Board was to have the general charge of the work, entrusting its direct management to an Executive Committee.

Near the close of 1894, Rev. Yokoi Tokio who, like Mr. Kanamori, was a member of the "Kumamoto Band," and one of the most prominent ministers in the Kumi-ai body, published a book entitled "The Problem of Christianity in Our Country." Dealing with questions upon the essence of Christianity and the future of evangelistic work in Japan, its position was that of extreme "liberalism" and naturalism. To many it seemed to go farther than Mr. Kanamori's book and to be more destructive of Christian faith. It did not, however, give rise to so much discussion; though this was in part because the views advocated were no longer novel.

Christian work was in various ways affected by the ratification, in 1894 and 1895, of new treaties between japan and Western nations. As has been previously noted, the Japanese had long desired to be relieved from extraterritoriality and from other restrictions imposed by the older treaties, and the reluctance of some nations to grant any concessions had caused much ill-will towards foreigners, Japan was now received as an equal, and this did much to foster good feeling. Missionaries were directly affected by the provision that, when the treaties should come into full effect in 1899, aliens would be allowed to travel or to reside in the interior. It will be remembered that hitherto only those foreigners that were in the employ of Japanese could live outside of the Open ports; and this led many missionaries to become teachers and to submit to various annoying regulations. For travel it had been necessary to obtain passports from the central Government. Hence, missionaries could not quickly respond to calls to visit places in the interior. It had been necessary in application for these passports to specify the exact route to be taken, and at times the Government refused to give those that were valid for more than a fortnight. Immediately after the new treaties were ratified, the Government began to grant permissions, good for one year, to travel in any part of the country. The missionaries rejoiced in this new freedom and there was much more touring in country districts than had before been possible.

It was in part an indirect result of the war that there came a great and rapid increase of industrial and commercial activity. Many factories were built, railroads were projected, and stock companies were formed for all sorts of enterprises. Japan seldom does things by halves, and the whole nation seemed to be affected by the spirit of commercialism. In some respects this had an unfavourable influence upon Christian activity. People were so occupied in devising ways to make money that it was hard to call their attention to spiritual things. Some Christians were so busy that they neglected religious duties; those engaged in manufactures found it easy to invent excuses for not observing the Sabbath; and others yielded to the temptations that beset those that are in haste to become rich. Even those that had entered the ministry were affected. Their education had a commercial value that enabled them to obtain remunerative employment. Some of them had been discouraged by lack of success in evangelistic labours, and thought they had mistaken their calling. Others had the idea that they would help the churches to financial independence by providing for their own support while continuing to preach the Gospel; but they soon found that the claims of business left them little time and strength for evangelistic work. Not only was there the loss of many from the ministry; but commercialism, theological doubts, and a general loss of earnestness combined to reduce greatly the number of young men studying in the theological schools.

The year 1895 brought an important change in the relations of the Kumi-ai Churches to the American Board Mission. The Kumi-ai Missionary Society had long received from the Board a subsidy that in recent years had amounted to about three times the contributions from Japanese sources. The missionaries, though often urging that this aid be relinquished, had not thought it wise to refuse it. Now at last, the churches decided to trust to their own resources for the support of the Missionary Society. For the most part the separation was made in a kindly spirit, though it was hastened by the dislike that the Japanese felt to the insistence by the Mission that, in justice to the interests of American contributors, it must retain the right of so far supervising the money entrusted to its care as to ensure that this would be used for propagating the fundamental truths of the Gospel. Some doubted whether the churches would be able to carry on a vigorous work alone, but increased responsibility gave new interest. The Japanese contributions in the last four years of joint support were respectively 1,130, 1,335, and 644 *yen;* but after the society became independent, its annual income never fell below 3,000 *yen,* a result the more noteworthy because the change took place at a time when the faith and earnestness of the churches seemed to be at the lowest ebb.

There had gradually arisen among the missionaries of the American Board much dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Doshisha.\* As the affairs of that institution occupy considerable space in the history of this and succeeding years, it may be well to recall a few facts concerning it. It will be remembered that it had been established by Dr. Neesima in co-operation with the missionaries. The American Board had given money for the erection of buildings and for other expenses, and had acted as the medium through which other contributions from American friends of missions had been bestowed. Its missionaries formed an important part of its teaching force. Since foreigners could not hold real estate in the interior of Japan, it was distinctly understood that the Board had no legal claim upon the property, unless possibly to insist that it should be used in conformity with the purpose for which it had been given. A company of Japanese had been formed with a brief constitution declaring that it should hold the property, should use it for the maintenance of Christian schools, and should have charge of all business arising between said schools and the Japanese Government. One article said that money contributed by the American Board should be expended under the direction of the missionaries of the Board after consultation with the President and the Japanese teachers of the school. After a time it seemed advisable to have a more thorough organisation and to put the financial management of the school entirely in the hands of a new company, which was necessarily composed of Japanese, though three members of the Mission were to act as Associate Trustees, giving advice but having no vote. The American Board continued to contribute to the funds of the Company, and gifts came from individual friends of the school in America. Money from Japanese donors was given with full knowledge that the Constitution declared Christianity to be "the foundation of the moral education promoted by the Company."

During Dr. Neesima's life and for a short time after his death, all went on satisfactorily. Then it seemed to the missionaries that the school was gradually losing its Christian character. Some of the teachers declared that they were in the school simply to give instruction, and that they were under no obligation to concern themselves with the moral condition of the pupils. One of the first marked occurrences to show the difference between the views of the missionaries and those of the Japanese teachers came in connection with a course of lectures given by Captain L. L. Janes. He was the man through whose influence the members of the "Kumamoto Band" had been led to a belief in Christianity. Some of them were now leading teachers in the Doshisha, one of them was its President, and others served on the Board of Trustees. Captain Janes had been in America for several years. His old pupils felt that the missionaries had failed to take his side as they ought when certain charges had been made against him; and this feeling lay at the bottom of many of the troubles that at this time crippled the educational and evangelistic work of the American Board Mission. After a while he returned to Japan, having been engaged as a teacher in one of the government schools in Kyoto. In the autumn of 1893 he was asked to speak before the Lecture Association of the Doshisha students. In his lectures he denounced theological instruction, criticised the church as the enemy of progress and liberty, sneered at missionaries, denied the existence of a personal God, and ridiculed fundamental Christian doctrines. The foreign teachers remonstrated with the person who, in the absence of the President, was in charge of the school; but he refused to interfere with the liberty of the students to have such lectures as they desired. Fortunately the students themselves, after two or three lectures, were unwilling to listen to more. They went to the lecturer, saying they did not care to have the course continued, and one of the advanced pupils, who had acted as interpreter, made a public apology of his own accord for having aided a person who was trying to tear down what Dr. Neesima had built up.

As time went on, the missionaries felt that more and more their influence was being undermined, especially by some of the teachers who, at the morning chapel exercises, in the classroom, and in public journals ridiculed them and their teaching. The missionaries were not alone in considering that the school was proving unfaithful to the principles on which it had been founded, for many of the alumni and Christian friends of the school grieved over what was being done.

For several years the Mission had been urging the Board to send some of its officers or corporate members to give advice regarding the settlement of perplexing questions. In the autumn of 1895 such a deputation, consisting of four members, reached Japan. Spending a little over two months in the country, they conferred with Japanese officials, missionaries of different societies, and prominent Japanese Christians, thus gathering much information about the general situation in Japan as also about that which gave rise to the specific problems calling for their consideration. In regard to the Doshisha they found "a marked concurrence in the opinion that a change had taken place in the spirit of the institution. It was quite generally affirmed that the Christian character and spiritual tone of the university are far less pronounced than formerly." In a conference with the Trustees an interpretation of the clause in the Constitution that made Christianity the foundation of the moral education promoted by the Company was sought. The following extract from the Report of the Deputation will show the position taken by each side:

"We asked if they would affirm as among the beliefs for which the Doshisha stood in Japan the personality of God, the divinity of Christ, and the future life. They declared that they could not. While as individuals they could affirm their acceptance of these beliefs, as Trustees they could not affirm them, since differences existed among Christians on these points, and they must not ally themselves with any party. When asked if they would accept the creed of the Kumi-ai churches in definition of the sense in which they used the word Christian, they declined, saying that they would thus identify themselves with a single denomination. When urged at two long conferences to make some statement, however brief, in language of their own, of what they meant by 'Christianity,' since the word did not in their minds involve the above-named beliefs, they declined. They said it was not necessary; that having declared their purpose to maintain a Christian institution they should be trusted so to do; that to affirm the above-named beliefs would narrow the basis of the university, would cause the resignation of professors whose services they did not wish to lose, would repel students who were encouraged now to enter the school by its spirit of free enquiry. . . . It was carefully explained to the Trustees that the American churches which contributed to the treasury of the Board, while not making a test of any creed, could hardly hold to be Christian those persons or institutions which deliberately refused to declare belief in a personal God and in the divinity of Jesus Christ, in the immortality of the soul, and in the supernatural elements of Christianity. The reply was that the whole subject had been a matter of thought with them; that theological opinion in Japan was in a formative state, and beliefs were unsettled; that for that reason and because it would be disastrous to act now under appearance of compulsion, they could make no statement whatever, except that they would maintain a Christian university."

It seemed to the Deputation that the American Board would not be justified in continuing indefinitely to use for the Doshisha money contributed for promoting Christian education in Japan; but in order not to make the change too abrupt, they recommended that for the time being the American teachers supplied to the Doshisha by the Board be continued, that co-operation in the Theological Department remain as before, and that the subsidy given by the Board to the Company be annually reduced, so as to cease at the end of the year 1898.

Concerning the condition of the churches the Deputation reported:

"Japan is characterised by the intensity with which it seizes a new idea. We believe the movement toward extreme liberalism in the Kumi-ai churches, which is not widespread, but which is championed by a few writers and public speakers, if left to its natural course, will soon disappear. A few who are involved may lose their faith in Christianity and leave the Church, but we believe the tendency to destructive criticism will be less in the future, and that the work of construction will be more prominent, The theological problems of the world are now discussed in Japan, and that too without a balancing foundation of Christian faith and life."

In October, 1895, a meeting of the pastors and evangelists of the Kumi-ai churches was held in Nara. It was so timed that the Deputation might attend some of its sessions. At this meeting the following "Declaration" was prepared:

"We who, believing and revering Jesus Christ as Saviour, are called of God, do greatly mourn over the present condition of the world, and assembled here in prayer unto God and in the rich enjoyment of the Holy Spirit's gracious influence, we determine to proclaim the Gospel and to establish the kingdom of God according to the following principles:

"1. That all men should repent of all sin, and through Christ should return unto obedience to the Heavenly Father.

"2. That all men being the children of God, the great principles of love and sympathy should be upheld among them.

"3. That the home should be purified by maintaining the principles of monogamy: and the mutual duties of parents and children, elder and younger brothers, should be fulfilled.

"4. That the nation should be elevated and the welfare of mankind promoted.

"5. That the hope of eternal life should be perfected through faith and righteousness."

By many, especially by those that desired to see a Japanese form of Christianity, this Declaration was hailed with great enthusiasm. A Japanese professor of the Doshisha wrote of it as being by far the most influential document yet issued by the Christians of Japan, and said: "Viewed from the standpoint of conciseness, of absence of dogmatism or theocratic tendency, and of the prominence given to morals and ethics based on the personal instructions of Christ, the instructions forming the basis of this creed must be considered as the best of their kind since the establishment of the Christian Church in Japan." By some others, who considered the document a production of those who were trying to combine Christianity with Confucian and Shinto elements, it was thought unsatisfactory because of what it omitted rather than for what it contained.

In September, 1895, the Salvation Army began work in Japan. Before this, two or three Japanese who had seen something of the Army in America or England had copied certain of its methods, but none of them had any connection with the central organisation. Those who now came began operations in both Yokohama and Tokyo. They adopted what was called "the native policy," that is, as in India and some other countries, they used the dress, food, and many customs of the people among whom they laboured. The sudden change to Japanese food brought serious illness to some of their number, and it was found advisable to modify the policy. Reports of what the Salvation Army had accomplished in England had preceded it to Japan, where not only were the Christians prepared to welcome it, but even some of the Buddhist periodicals praised what it had done for the degraded and criminal classes. Headquarters were opened in Tokyo, and the usual methods for attracting the attention of the people were pursued. Ere long a Japanese edition of *The War Cry* was published; and in after years, as the number of soldiers increased, the work extended to other cities; efforts for sailors, discharged convicts, prostitutes, and other classes, being added to the general proclamation of the Gospel.

In December the United Brethren in Christ established a mission in Japan, the Missionary Secretary of the denomination visiting the country in company with a Japanese minister who had been educated in America, and who was now put in charge of the work. He proved unfitted for such responsibility, and the work was continued in ways like those of other missions.

Leprosy is very common in Japan. Exact statistics are not obtainable; for the disease is considered to bring such disgrace upon the family which it enters that its existence is often concealed. When the family is in comfortable circumstances, the patient is usually shut off in a separate room in order that he may not be seen by outsiders, and there he must remain until his death. In other cases the man often becomes an outcast, being left to beg and prolong his miserable existence as best he may. Rev. M. L. Gordon, D.D., in "An American Missionary in Japan" tells of one such sufferer.

"He was one of the original members of the church, and it was known at the time that he had the taint of leprosy in his system. The dread disease was, however, quiescent, and it was hoped would remain so, and hence he mingled freely with the other Christians, visited us in our homes, and often sat with us at the communion table. But of late years the disease became virulent, and by the end of 1890 he was totally blind and otherwise greatly disfigured. The unchristian villagers drove him out of the village; his brothers and other relatives deserted him; and he lived alone in a rude hut in the mountains, receiving a little aid from the prefectural government and more from the Japanese Christians and missionaries. At a later period the Christians cooked his food and otherwise cared for him, but for quite a while he built his own fire and cooked his own rice, going, in his solitary blindness, to and from the spring that furnished him with water, guided by the straw rope which had been put there for that purpose. The evangelist. . . went to condole with him, but to his surprise he was met by the assurance that he was not an object of condolence; that his heart was full of joy, because *Kami* go *shiju maga ushiro ni oru, '*God is always behind me."'

About 1886 a Roman Catholic priest had established at Gotemba an asylum for lepers and in 1894 Miss Youngman of the Presbyterian Mission began a similar work in a suburb of Tokyo. The attention of Miss S. Riddell, an English missionary living in Kumamoto, was also drawn to this pitiable class of sufferers. In the vicinity of Kumamoto are small villages whose populations are almost wholly composed of such persons. Of one village it was commonly said: "Everybody in it is a leper except the stone idol." Large numbers of lepers from other parts of Japan make their way to Kumamoto in order to pray at a shrine dedicated to Kato Kiyomasa, the former persecutor of the Christians, which, because he became a leper, gained the reputation of being a favourable place for gaining relief from the dread disease. At almost any time many of them can be seen about this shrine engaged in prayer or asking for alms. There was reason to hope that by proper medical treatment some of these persons could be permanently benefited, and through the efforts of Miss Riddell and her friends funds were raised for the erection of a hospital which was dedicated in November, 1895. Since then it has brought both physical and spiritual blessings to those that have been gathered within its walls.

Among the indirect results of Christianity has been that it has spurred to new energy other systems with which it has come in contact. The Buddhists saw that it was necessary for them to exert themselves if they wished to retain their hold upon the people. Some of their leading magazines spoke in strong terms concerning the corruption and indolence of the priesthood. In May, 1895, the Minister of Home Affairs issued instructions that higher intellectual standards should be required of those becoming Shinto or Buddhist priests. Among other things this document said:

"Priests of either Shinto or Buddhist sects, charged as they are with the grave duty of propagating religious doctrines, ought to combine learning and virtue so as to command the respect of the people. Hence the processes pursued for testing their qualifications should be specially scrupulous and exact, everything savouring of partiality being carefully avoided. It is nevertheless commonly reported of the priests now in holy orders that not a few are distinguished neither by learning nor by virtuous conduct, and are entirely unfitted for their posts."

The better class of priests felt keenly the disgrace involved in this censure from the Government and in the comments made upon it by secular papers. One writer in a Buddhist magazine wrote in the gloomiest terms concerning the future of religion, which, he said, was holding its own only by the force of inertia, being sustained by the old and middle-aged, and even they were gradually growing cold in the faith. He added:

"Ten years hence nobody will be able to find religious peace in Buddhism. Within that time it will fail in all its endeavours. Its discipline will become powerless, its temples deserted, its believers and priests decimated. If present Buddhism is not reformed by some great man, it will have fallen into a state of hopeless decay by the end of the century."

The more progressive priests had before this imitated the methods adopted by Christians. They had established schools for boys and girls, summer schools, philanthropic societies, Young Men's Buddhist Associations, and other organisations. One magazine now published an article entitled "Learn from Christianity," in which the activity of the Christians, their readiness to adapt themselves to the national situation, and their spirit of devotion to principles rather than to money, were held up as worthy of imitation. Other magazines urged that the spirit and methods of the Christians be more generally copied. Though Buddhism as a system had given but little honour to women, it was now urged that they were well fitted to spread the tenets of their faith, and they were exhorted to speak of religion in their homes, to organise women's societies, and to establish kindergartens, girls' schools, and schools for nurses.

*The Church* for September, 1896, published an article by Rev. T. T. Alexander, D.D., on "The Problems before the Church of Japan." What he said upon two points will throw some light upon the condition of Christian work at the period that we are now considering. The first problem mentioned was that of how the masses were to be reached. He said:

"The last ten years have witnessed a very widespread evangelism in Japan. Both missionaries and Japanese evangelists have gone on evangelistic tours throughout the land, penetrating into the remotest country districts, not only preaching but, as far as possible, making the work permanent by establishing regular preaching places or churches. They have been followed and in many cases preceded by colporteurs and Bible-women carrying the Gospel to the very doors of the people. In the great centres, like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, churches and preaching-places may be counted by the score, in some of which the Gospel is preached daily. Preaching services are frequently held in the public parks. Opportunities are sought on festival days and at national or local expositions; and mass meetings are often held for preaching the Word. In short, there has been a steady, faithful, and persistent effort made to give the Gospel to the people, whether they would hear or forbear. Over and above more direct results, a general impression has been created that, after all, Christianity is not such a bad thing, that in fact it may be a very good thing. And yet, it must be confessed, the masses have hardly been touched and the question 'How shall we reach them?' presses hard upon the church to-day. . . The lower and peasant classes are still powerfully under the influence of the past and largely Buddhistic in faith, loose in morals, idolatrous and superstitious to the last degree. The middle classes are more hopeful but still largely indifferent, not to say hostile, toward Christianity; while the higher classes, for the most part, are sceptical and distant in their attitude. Young men of all classes are generally non-religious and atheistic."

Concerning the problem of education, Dr. Alexander wrote:

"This is one of the most important and most pressing of all the questions now before the church. Christian education must be had; but how can it be secured?\! The government schools from the kindergarten to the university are on a purely secular basis, religious instruction of every sort being strictly ruled out. Religion may, however, be freely taught in private schools, and these may be multiplied indefinitely without interference on the part of the Government. On the face of it, therefore, the problem would seem to be easy of solution. As long as so much liberty is accorded private schools, there ought to be no serious difficulty, one might suppose, in providing Christian education for all who will avail themselves of it. Now it is true that there are a great many Christian schools in Japan for both sexes and of different grades, most of them dependent upon the missions for financial aid as well as for help in teaching, and so long as the missions are willing to continue their support the schools can be kept going. The chief difficulty, however, does not lie here, but rather in the fact that private schools as such labour under very decided disadvantages when compared with the government schools. The latter confer upon their students certain privileges which private schools cannot confer—such as freedom from military conscription while in school, admission to competitive examinations for civil service, etc. To put it in another way, students of private schools are not exempt from military conscription and hence may be drafted into the army at any time; they cannot enter government schools except by examination, and when they have graduated from the private schools they are forever excluded from the civil service, so that no public career can ever be open to them, no matter how great their abilities or attainments. Hence the number of students, particularly of boys, in Christian schools is kept down to a comparatively low figure; even Christians preferring to forego their natural preference for a Christian education in order to secure for their sons the advantages which the government schools alone can give,"

In order to avoid the disadvantages under which private schools laboured, some of them sought and gained recognition from the Government as being on a par with the public schools, and so entitled to the same privileges. With some of the Christian schools this change apparently involved no interference with religion; but whether because of the rulings of local education officials, or because the spirit within the school itself led to the minimising of the religious element, the Doshisha decided that it was necessary to drop all Biblical study from the curriculum of the academical department, This became the subject of much earnest discussion in meetings of the faculty held for the purpose of revising the course of study; the foreign teachers protesting against the change and against other action that seemed to them subversive of the principles on which the school had been established. It was becoming more and more evident that the two elements, represented on the one side by the missionary teachers, and on the other by the most influential Japanese teachers and trustees, could no longer be harmonised. At the annual meeting of the trustees in April, they passed resolutions in which, after thanking the American Board for its former aid, they said: "In order to make clear our relation to the American Board, we decline to receive, after the close of 1896, its customary gift of annual subsidy and its aid of missionary teachers." An explanatory letter sent by the President of the Trustees to the missionaries said: "I can assure you that the Trustees have no intention whatever of turning you out from the institution where some of you have worked so long and so devotedly, nor any desire that your connection with it should cease. I say confidently that we all desire and earnestly hope that you will stay here and aid us in the good work of Christian education." The thought of the writer seems to have been that the missionaries might continue to give their services to the Doshisha as individuals and not as representatives of the Board that continued to support them.

The Mission of the American Board held its annual meeting in July. A letter sent to the Doshisha Trustees said:

"The fundamental principles of Christianity, which were dear to the hearts of the founders of the Doshisha, to those of the American friends who have given thousands of dollars for its support, and which are not less dear to the hearts of all the members of our Mission, have been publicly assailed or ridiculed from the platform of the school and in other ways by persons connected with the administration; and instead of listening to the earnest protests of the representatives of the Mission, the Trustees have in one instance promoted an instructor who has been most active in assailing the Christian foundations of the institution to be the head of an important department. . . . There is no longer a unity of feeling and practice in the Doshisha but rather such a wide divergence as to render it unwise, if not impossible, for any of our number to continue to cooperate as teachers in the school."

It was thought best by the foreign teachers that their connection with the school should cease at once, instead of in the middle of a school year, and accordingly they sent in their resignations. In September the President of the Doshisha gave to the Kyoto Government a paper containing the following promises:

"1. The moral education of the Doshisha Ordinary Middle School will be founded upon the Imperial Educational Rescript. Avoiding the needless discussion of the extremes of ethical theory, its aim will be practical. It will seek to inculcate an earnest spirit of loyalty and filial obedience by which the people shall each honour his own ancestors and all shall reverence the spirits of the Imperial Ancestors. The teachers will always seek to cultivate in the minds of the pupils an earnest desire for the country's good, for this we regard as the very highest aim of popular education.

"2. On the National Holidays the pupils will be called together, the Imperial Educational Rescript will be read to them, and they will be carefully instructed as to the Imperial will, or taught of the great virtues and illustrious deeds of past Emperors, or of the lives and teachings of the ancient sages; or other addresses suitable to the National Holidays may be given them in order to cultivate a spirit of loyalty to the Emperor and of love to the country. This is the purpose which we hope to carry into practice.

"3. In the graduation and like exercises in the Doshisha Ordinary Middle School religious exercises or ceremonies as a means of propagating religion will not, of course, be held, but there will be an effort to deeply impress the students with the precepts of the Imperial Educational Rescript."\*

Now the Constitution of the Doshisha said: "Christianity is the foundation of the moral education promoted by this company." Persons who criticised the present substitution of the Imperial Rescript for Christianity were accused of holding the view that the two were opposed to each other; an argument that could be made very effective in such a country as Japan. The future course of events showed that another important step had been taken in the departure of the institution from its original standards. Indeed, there seemed to be no need for the declaration made to the Kyoto Government unless it was to show to the officials that Christianity was no longer the controlling principle of the school.

The action of the Doshisha Trustees was severely criticised by many Japanese Christians and to some extent by others. One Shinto periodical spoke of the relations of the institution to the American Board as that of a child to its parent, and reprobated the unfilial spirit that had been shown. "Regarded altogether apart from Christianity," it said, "the conduct of the Doshisha is unseemly. How much worse does it appear when it is remembered that the chief actors in the scene just witnessed profess the gospel of love, peace, and charity."

Even with private schools of lower grades, there were advantages in obtaining the recognition of the Government. In some cases it was found impossible to do this without the surrender of principle. When the Ferris Seminary in Yokohama sought a license for its primary department, it was told that the request could be granted only on condition that the school would promise that no distinctively Christian instruction would be given to its pupils. Further enquiry showed that attendance at church and at morning prayers would be interpreted as receiving Christian instruction, and so the school saw no course but to withdraw its request.

In September, 1896, there was a gathering at the villa of Viscount Matsudaira in Tokyo, of prominent persons connected with different religious systems. Nineteen Buddhist priests, sixteen Christians, two Shintoists, and five other persons were present. The professed object of the meeting was to promote friendly feelings between those of different beliefs. The speakers, as was natural, emphasised the similarities and minimised the differences between the religions represented. Many of the addresses were permeated with nationalistic ideas. A prominent Christian pastor said: "At the present time the prevailing spirit in Japan is in favour of nationalism, and I take it that the object of this meeting is to adapt religion to this condition, to intensify the nationalistic spirit, and by showing that it is endorsed by the teaching of our creeds, to render those creeds a power in the world." Other speeches were of a similar tenor. Some Christian newspapers spoke of the meeting as a proof that Christianity had won for itself a place where other religions were forced to recognise it as on an equal footing with themselves. Many believers, however, regarded the meeting with little favour, considering it an outcome of the movement that was weakening the faith and zeal of many of the Christians by minimising fundamental doctrines.

It will be remembered that several Christians had been serving as moral instructors in the prisons of the Hokkaido. A change in administration brought in a superintendent strongly prejudiced against Christianity, who soon adopted such measures as made the instructors feel that it was unwise for them to remain. Some of them, however, found other ways in which they could labour for the criminal classes. The pioneer in the work for prisoners had been Mr. Hara Taneaki. He continued to publish for the benefit of convicts a magazine that was admitted into many prisons of the land. He also sent it to many discharged criminals, especially to those whom he had known in the prisons. At a later date he established in Tokyo a temporary home for ex-prisoners, and in other ways he did much to help this class of men.

The Hokkaido was being gradually occupied by settlers moving thither from the main island. In some cases, companies of Christians united in founding colonies. Rev. W. R. Andrews, of the Church Missionary Society, in 1898 thus described the condition of one of these villages whose very name showed the faith of its settlers:

"Emmanuel Mura is a settlement where there are sixty Christians. Of these, twenty belong to the Seikokwai \(Native Episcopal Church\) and the rest to the Congregational Church. The Seikokwai Christians have their own little church building, having erected it last year, mostly with their own hands. Sunday is well kept in this village; no one thinks of doing any work All get up later, don their best clothes, and come to church for service at ten, and stay in church till twelve or one. The service proper lasts an hour, but religious talk, etc., keeps them afterwards. The Sunday-school, too, is generally going on while the adults are having their talk. In the evening there is another service. I was told that, however fine the day, no one would ever go out into the fields for work."

In November of the same year, the present writer spent a Sunday with the Congregationalists of this village. The meeting was held in the cabin of one of the settlers, a rough building about thirty by fifteen feet in size, made of reeds bound to a framework of poles. The wind, rain, and sleet found easy access on every side. In the centre of the hut was a square fireplace, the fire being built on the ground. The fuel consisted of split logs about three feet long. One end of these blazed in the centre of the fireplace, and as the logs burned away they were gradually pushed up towards the flame, new ones being added from time to time. On three sides of the fireplace were the boards that covered one-half of the floor-space, the rest being the bare ground. There was no chimney and no opening in the roof except the crevices between the reeds with which it was thatched. In moments of calm, the smoke rose quietly upward to where the poles and reeds had been coloured a glossy, oily black from the accumulations of former years; but every few moments a puff of wind would send the smoke into the faces of those that sat about the fire. The colonists paid little attention to this beyond squinting up their eyes when the smoke was thicker than usual, but the visitor found it best to carry on the conversation with closed eyes, and when the time came for him to preach he became in truth a weeping prophet. The people themselves were not so rough as their surroundings. Their conversation showed them to be thoughtful persons, and some of them had received a good education. One shelf in the hut was heavily laden with books, most of them being of a solid character. These Congregationalists of the Hokkaido might well remind the visitor of those that colonised New England. The eastern boundary of their settlement was marked by a post inscribed: "Love never faileth," and the western by one on which was written: "The truth shall make you free."

Even in those sections of the country that had been brought into the closest relations with foreigners, the old feeling of bitter opposition to Christianity had not wholly passed away. The Southern Baptist Mission opened a new station in Nagasaki. At the first meeting a large crowd gathered about the doors to make a disturbance. The most abusive language was used so vociferously that even those close to the preacher could not hear what he said. It seemed so useless to continue the meeting that it was brought to a close and the doors were shut. There had been such threats of personal violence that there was fear of what might happen if another attempt should be made to open the preaching-place, A meeting was, however, advertised for a few evenings later. Hardly had it begun before an old man came in, and after making a profound bow took his seat upon the floor. He was followed by others until the room was nearly full. Although a crowd gathered before the house, there was no disturbance. The reason for this was learned at the close of the meeting when the old man introduced himself as the chief officer of the ward, and apologised for the previous disturbance.

Among the visitors that spent only a short time in Japan, perhaps none exerted a more beneficent influence than John R. Mott, Secretary of the World's Student Christian Federation, Reaching the country in November, 1896, he visited forty-two schools, and in all of them made a deep impression upon the students. At Tokyo, twelve hundred students of the Imperial University listened to his addresses, and eleven hundred young men were present at a meeting held in Kyoto. Many of the meetings took the form of evangelistic services with after-meetings, in which the way of salvation through Christ was carefully taught to those who remained. The eleven existing College Young Men's Christian Associations were greatly strengthened, and new ones that were organised increased the number to twenty-eight. About one-half were in other than the Christian schools. In January, 1897, their delegates met in Tokyo and formed a Union of the Student Young Men's Christian Associations of Japan, which the next summer was admitted to the World's Student Federation.

The number of missions was increased by the coming in November, 1896, of Elder W. C. Granger, the first representative of the Seventh-day Adventists. Elder Granger died in 1899, but by that time others had come to continue the work of this mission.

Several events occurring in 1897 brought up the old questions concerning the possibility of Christians being loyal to the Emperor. Some of them gave rise to considerable discussion in the newspapers. A student was expelled from the Normal School in Yamaguchi because of a criticism he was said to have made upon the Imperial Rescript, The persecution was begun by his fellow-students, who presented the following charges against him:

"1. He says that God is superior to His Majesty the Emperor.

"2. He tries to change the Imperial Rescript so as to make it accord with his own beliefs.

"3. He reads the Bible more than his text-books.

"4. He said that after his conversion to Christianity he became more desirous than before to enter the Normal School.

"5. He talked to Sunday school children in the summer vacation.

"6. He said that he was under great responsibility to lead others to the true religion."

More attention was drawn to a case occurring in the Normal School of Niigata, Every year two of its graduates were sent to the High Normal School in Tokyo. Nominally the choice of the persons to be sent rested with the prefectural Governor, who was supposed to base the appointment upon the examination papers of candidates; but in reality the principal of the school decided the matter. The graduate that passed the best examination in 1897 was a Christian. The principal refused to appoint him, giving as a reason that Christianity was contrary to the Imperial Rescript, and hence, one holding that religion ought not to receive the honour in question. Several members of the faculty protested against the decision. The discussion soon found its way into the newspapers of Niigata; one upholding the principal, while two condemned his action. The press in other parts of the country also published articles upon the matter. Finally, at a meeting held in the school, the Governor made an address in which he rebuked the principal and declared that there was nothing antagonistic between Christianity and the Rescript. He said that, since the Constitution guaranteed religious liberty, a man's belief should not affect his promotion, which ought to he based on ability alone. The principal's appointee had already begun his studies in Tokyo, so it seemed to the Governor that it would be unwise to recall him; but he gave assurance that the Christian could have the appointment the next year, and at once promoted him to a much better school than the one in which he had begun to teach.

A movement that attracted considerable attention because of the University professors and other scholars who were its leaders aimed at a revival of Shinto. A magazine entitled *Nihon Shugi* \(Japanese Principles\) was published, and the movement was popularly known by the same name. The writers contended that Japan was in danger of losing her national characteristics by wholesale borrowing from foreign countries, that an attempt must be made to arouse the nationalistic sentiments of the masses, and that the best way to do this would be by reviving the worship of the ancient gods. All Japanese Christians were challenged to give plain answers to the following questions:

"1. Can the worship of His Sacred Majesty the Emperor, which every loyal Japanese performs, be reconciled with the worship of God and Christ by Christians?

"2. Can the existence of authorities that are quite independent of the Japanese State, such as God, Christ, the Bible, the Pope, the Head of the Greek Church \(the Czar\), be regarded as harmless?

"3, Can a Japanese who is a faithful servant of Christ be regarded as at the same time a faithful servant of the Emperor and a true friend of His Majesty's faithful subjects? Or, to put the question in another way, is our Emperor to follow in the wake of Western emperors and to pray: 'Son of God, have mercy upon me'?

"4. Can the Christian convert answer the above questions in a manner that will satisfy our reason?"

The Christian papers ridiculed these questions as showing that loud professions of loyalty were being used as a device to uphold a weak cause. The movement, though at first pushed with considerable vigour, soon passed from notice without having presented any formidable obstacle to the progress of Christianity.

Much began to be written about the same time by Buddhists concerning the dangers that might come to their religion when in 1899, according to the revised treaties, foreigners would be permitted to reside in any part of the country. It seemed to be the common opinion in Japan that large numbers of Europeans and Americans would hasten to avail themselves of the new privileges. A Buddhist magazine collected opinions from other periodicals of the same faith, and thus summarised them:

"I. Mixed residence will help Christianity and prove disadvantageous to Buddhism for:

"1. Christianity will gain new energy.

"2. Buddhism is like a body without a soul.

II. The prosperity of Christianity will prevent the unity of the people:

"1. Because of collision of feeling between Buddhism and Christianity.

"2. Because of the close relations of Christianity with foreign nations.

"3. Because Christians do not place much importance upon the state.

"III. Ecclesiastical police regulations should be strictly enforced.

"IV. The establishment of religious institutions should require the approval of the Government.

"V. Labourers should not be neglected by religious teachers.

"VI. Buddhists should take advantage of education for the discipline of their minds.

"VII. Rolls of parishioners should be prepared."

In the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\) the question of the relation between the presbyteries and the foreign missions was vigorously discussed. The missions associated with this church gave financial aid to the evangelistic efforts of the presbyteries. In addition to this some missions had such work of their own, paying wholly or in part the salaries of evangelists, who were therefore under the direction of the missions concerned. This was displeasing to many of the Japanese, who wished all such work to be brought under the direction of presbyteries, and to have these entrusted with all funds used in this way. In July, 1897, the Synod, after hearing the report of a committee which declared that it had not found "a single case of proper co-operation," passed a resolution whose preamble defined a cooperating mission as one "that plans and executes all its evangelistic operations through a committee composed of equal numbers of the representatives of a mission working within the bounds of a presbytery of the Church of Christ in Japan, and of members of said presbytery." The position of the Japanese is more fully expressed in the following words of Rev, Oshikawa Masayoshi, one of their leaders:

"Our desire is to control all evangelistic work under these proposed co-operating committees. My opinion and that of others is that the work of missions independent of presbyteries is hostile to the genuine work of the presbytery and the Church. It tends to create a missionary party composed of men of inferior class who obey the missionary and have a foreign, exotic character."

Another person said:

"This is no longer the time for missionaries to control, but they and the boards should stand off and let the Japanese control The old slavish time must end and the Japanese Church established by the Christians of America must be followed, not

This last quotation shows one of the difficulties that has attended attempts at what from an Occidental standpoint would be considered co-operation. The Japanese have had but little idea of the association of partners with equal rights. In business matters one member of the firm was recognised as its head and all others were subordinate to him. He expected that his plans would be followed, even though the majority might not think his policy the best. If dissatisfaction grew too strong, either the head partner withdrew or the whole partnership came to an end. The same method prevailed in political matters; the parties being made up of those that followed such leaders as Ito, Itagaki, Okuma, etc., rather than of those whose political views were similar. To the Japanese Christians it seemed as though in their relations with the missionaries they must be either servants or masters; that one side must acknowledge the pre-eminence of the other. Hence, it is not strange that with the increase of the nationalistic spirit the Japanese desired to make it evident that they were not controlled by the foreigners, and that everything connected in any way with their church was fully under its authority. Where the experiment of having joint committees composed of equal numbers of Japanese and foreigners was tried, it was usually found that the latter must always yield to the views of the former, or else find themselves the object of much ill-feeling, which sometimes led to efforts for undermining their work and influence.

To the missionaries it did not seem advisable to put everything out of their own hands at so early a date. They feared that the interest of the Japanese in some features of the work would lead them to neglect others of equal importance. Moreover, the placing of a large sum of money coming from foreign sources in the hands of committees such as were proposed seemed inadvisable, at least until the raising of larger amounts by the Japanese Church than it was then contributing should increase the sense of responsibility for choosing men well fitted to administer the funds. Accordingly the Council of Co-operating Missions declared its opinion that co-operation is "best carried out where the Japanese Church in its Sessions, Presbyteries, and Synod directs all ecclesiastical matters, availing itself of the counsels and assistance of missions or missionaries as occcasion arises; while the missions direct their own educational, evangelistic, and other missionary operations, availing themselves, likewise, of whatever counsel and assistance they may be able to obtain from their brethren in the Japanese Church." This decision was far from pleasing to the Japanese leaders, and though open discussion of the question ceased for a while, it was actively renewed a few years later.

In considering this question of co-operation the Council was helped by the advice of Mr. Robert E. Speer, a secretary of the \(Northern\) Presbyterian Board of Missions, who was spending a short time in japan. Mr. Speer also rendered valuable aid to the missionary work in general by addresses made in several cities. Another visitor of the year was Rev. J. H. Barrows, D.D., who, as President of the World's Parliament of Religions, held at the Columbian Exhibition, had become well known to Buddhists and Shintoists as well as to Christians. Large audiences listened to his lectures, some of which were afterwards published.

In 1898 the attention of Christians and of the general public was drawn in an increasing degree to the course of events in the Doshisha. We have already seen that in the preceding year Biblical instruction had been abolished from its Ordinary Middle School and that in its graduation and other public exercises all religious features were discontinued. In order to make plain what was now done, it is necessary to look at the first chapter of the Constitution of the Doshisha, which was as follows:

"chapter 1.-fundamental principles.

"1. This Company is established to promote moral and intellectual education in close union.

"2. The name of the Company is *The Doshisha.* All schools of the Company must have *Doshisha* as a part of their name, and this Constitution applies to them all.

"3. Christianity is the foundation of the moral education promoted by this Company.

"4, This Company is located at Kyoto.

"5. The principal of the permanent funds of the Company is not to be used under any circumstances.

"6. The above five articles are unchangeable,"

Another article of the Constitution required the Trustees to promise that they would "labour for the interests of the Company in accordance with its Fundamental Principles."

The confidence that this Constitution inspired in the minds of foreign friends of the Doshisha had made them willing to pursue the plan, which, at least on so large a scale, was unprecedented in the history of missions, of placing large sums of money for building and endowment in the hands of the natives of the country for whose benefit they were intended. It was a bold experiment. Had it worked satisfactorily, it would have had great influence on mission policy in Japan and other lands; but the course pursued by the Trustees alienated the sympathies of those who considered that their gifts had been misused, and excited the condemnation of others who felt that injustice had been done. Few Japanese upheld the action of the Trustees; and even opponents of Christianity censured them, perhaps being glad of this opportunity to declare that Christian leaders were guilty of grave dishonesty.

When the Trustees applied to the Government for privileges like those enjoyed by public schools and by a few private schools of the same grade, the officials of the Educational Department said it would be impossible to grant the request to a school that was avowedly religious; but that, if this defect could be remedied, the desired privilege would be given. The Trustees found a shrewd way in which to gain the tempting prize thus held out to them. As with Achilles, the weak point in the First Chapter of the Constitution was in its heel. It will be noticed that the Sixth Article declared the preceding five to be unchangeable. In February, 1898, it was voted to *strike out this Sixth Article,* thus leaving the others at the mercy of the Trustees. Their purpose was then accomplished by dropping from the Second Article the words: "And this Constitution applies to them all." This allowed what the President of the Doshisha called "taking down the Christian sign" by making the Third Article no longer applicable to the departments known as the Middle School, the College, the School of Law and Economics, and the Scientific School; while it was still in force with the remnant of the Theological School, which since the withdrawal of missionary teachers had been reduced to five students.

It should be said that this action was brought about by a company of men deeply imbued with the nationalistic spirit and an extremely liberal theology. Of the ten Trustees that were present when the vote was taken, five had served less than a year, and some of the others had not for a long time taken any active interest in the Doshisha. One Trustee, who had not been present at the meeting, immediately resigned because unwilling to countenance such action, while another is said to have sent a letter of protest. The acquiescence of some others was owing to that characteristic of the Japanese which, as already noticed, gives the responsibility for the conduct of a firm or company to the one that is recognised as its head. They considered that loyalty to the President required that they allow him to carry out his own policy without let or hindrance. The only alternatives would be the deposition of the President or their own resignation, and they were not ready to take either of these steps. Hence in the discussion that followed they felt compelled to defend the action that had been taken or at least not to express any dissatisfaction with it.

An outburst of indignation followed the announcement of what had been done. In several cities the alumni of the school met and passed resolutions in which they called upon the Trustees either to rescind their action or to resign. The alumni of one city, however, voted in their favour. Some local conferences of the Kumi-ai Churches expressed strong disapproval, and soon afterwards the General Conference of all these churches passed the following resolutions:

"1. That the recent action of the Doshisha Trustees in changing the Constitution was immoral.

"2. That the Kumi-ai Churches admonish the Trustees to restore the Constitution to its original form."

The leading newspapers abounded with editorials and contributed articles concerning the Doshisha, nearly all of them condemning the action of the Trustees, These, in trying to propitiate public opinion, offered various explanations of their deed. They asserted that whatever obligations there might be to foreign donors of funds to the school, these must yield precedence to what was due to Japan itself. Considerable money had come from Japanese who had no interest in Christianity, and in future years more and more dependence must be placed upon such support. The views of the missionaries ought no longer to control. The time had come for deciding whether the Doshisha was a Japanese or a foreign institution. It was folly to speak of an unchangeable constitution. Even the constitutions of great nations are amended from time to time, and that of a school must be adapted to changing circumstances. Though the Christian sign had been taken down, the reality remained. Had not the Constitution been amended, there would have been left little except the sign, for it would have been impossible to retain many students. The teachers were now exerting a religious influence over the pupils. On Sundays there were preaching services and Bible classes for those that wished to attend them. Thus the real Christian character of the school was retained and was even stronger than before. Was it not better to be exerting Christian influence over a large number of young men than to have empty buildings, even though the latter displayed the sign, "This is a Christian institution"?

In regard to these last arguments it must be said that in the opinion of most persons the general religious and moral condition of the school did not justify the assertion that Christian influences were strong. Some said, also, that if the statements made by the Trustees when trying to propitiate Christian opinion were correct, then the promise made to the Educational Department was being violated. Thus the *Japan Mail* said: "Either the pledge has not been kept in good faith, or the paramount object of the school has been abandoned. Either the Japanese authorities are the victims of deception or the American contributors have been deceived."

Most of the foreign contributions to the Doshisha had either been given directly by the American Board or obtained through its influence. Accordingly this society felt that it ought to do all in its power to prevent such marked perversion of funds. It sent out as its legal representative, Hon. N. W. McIvor, who had at a former period been the United States Consul General in Japan. The reputation that he had gained in his term of office, and his acquaintance with prominent men, gave him special fitness for a task in which he showed great skill and tact. Besides his efforts to make the Trustees see the mistake they had made, he enlisted the interest of some high officials in the case. Some of these were men who had highly esteemed Dr. Neesima and contributed to the fund that he collected for the Doshisha. Mr. Mc-Ivor was able to show them that the nation itself was likely to suffer from what had occurred. Foreigners were adducing the case of the Doshisha as a proof that the Japanese were not to be trusted in financial matters. In one case a commercial company that tried to raise funds in America had been met with the objection that after what had taken place in Kyoto no one could have faith in the Japanese. Courteously, but firmly, Mr. Mc Ivor said that, unless a satisfactory settlement could be made in some other way, he should feel compelled to bring the matter into the courts. He was aware that the condition of Japanese law rendered the prospect of success very dubious; but that would not prevent him from pushing the matter, if necessary, to the Supreme Court. The foreign merchants, who had been almost unanimously opposed to the new treaties that put their interests under Japanese law, were urging Mr. McIvor to do this, for they thought that thus their own contention that the laws were defective would be proved to the world. Count Okuma, who was then Prime Minister, had before Mr. McIvor's coming, expressed disapproval of the Trustees, and it was evident to him as to others that it would be very unfortunate for the reputation of Japan to have the case made so prominent. A judgment in favour of the Trustees would be more disastrous than one against them, since it would show that Japanese law did not provide sufficient security for entrusted funds. Hopes were entertained that the Department of Education would grant religious freedom to private schools, and that this would help to bring about a satisfactory arrangement with the Trustees; but just then the Ministry went out of office. Count Okuma, however, continued to take an active interest in the affairs of the Doshisha and helped in bringing about a settlement. In December the Trustees decided to resign, and another board was elected that adopted a new Constitution, embodying the principles of the original one. It must be said in praise of the resigning Trustees that in the end they acted in a most courteous manner, providing a way by which the transfer to their successors was made easy.\*

One of the new Trustees of the Doshisha was Rev. Tomeoka Kosuke, a graduate of the Theological Department, who had formerly been one of the Christian teachers of morals employed in the prisons of the Hokkaido. Afterwards he had spent two years in the United States. For several months he was in the Reformatory at Concord, Massachusetts, living for the most part the life of the prisoners themselves, though retaining his liberty. He ate their food, laboured with them in the workshops, and in other ways gained a clear idea of the practical working of the institution. He also spent six months in the office of the Secretary of the New York Prison Association. By the time that he returned to Japan, a change of officials had put an end to the work of Christian teachers in the Hokkaido prisons. Mr. Tomeoka therefore became the pastor of a church in Tokyo, and the editor of a Christian paper. About the beginning of 1898 the newly appointed warden of the Sugamo Prison in Tokyo, found that there were connected with it three Buddhist priests whose duties consisted in the reading of prayers and the preaching of sermons. He decided to dismiss two of these and to appoint Mr. Tomeoka as an instructor in morals. As soon as this became known, the temple to which the priests belonged said that it would not allow the last one to remain and share his duties with the teacher of a foreign faith. At the same time a high official of the sect addressed a letter to the Minister of Home Affairs, inquring whether, in view of the fact that Buddhism was the publicly recognised religion of Japan, while Christianity was merely a private belief adopted by individuals, the Minister approved of the ignoring of this distinction at Sugamo and the placing of both religions upon the same footing. Other temples and sects joined in remonstrating against what had been done; and the Buddhist Young Men's Association issued a circular letter threatening that, if the authorities did not withdraw the Christian teacher, a violent agitation would be begun against the Government. The Buddhists won a partial victory, for the warden was removed to another prison. It was said at the time that Mr. Tomeoka, following a suggestion from the Department of Home Affairs, given through the Chief of Police, sent in his resignation. However that may have been, he continued for some time to act as teacher in the prison, and after a while was made an instructor in the School for Prison Officials, a position in which he was able to accomplish much for prison reform, while he also had time to open before long a school for the reform of wayward children. In connection with this last he afterwards had a training-school for officials who were to engage in reformatory work.

It will be noticed that in the remonstrance against Mr. Tomeoka's appointment Buddhism was spoken of in terms that virtually asserted its claim to be considered the state religion; and about that time there began an agitation in favour of its receiving acknowledgment as such. A club was formed whose membership was open to those belonging to any Buddhist sect, or, "whose hearts have felt the influence of Buddhism." Among its objects were; "To induce the Government to recognise Buddhism publicly; to urge the Government to proclaim clearly and speedily the policy it intends to pursue towards religion; to persuade the Government to take the publicly recognised faith under its protection, subjecting it at the same time to strict supervision; and to work for the spread of Buddhism, thrusting aside every one, whether official or layman, who attempts to place obstacles in the path." A representation was sent to the next Parliament urging such action as would insure that in future only such persons as were followers of the state religion should be appointed in the prisons as instructors in morals.

The Unitarian Mission stood so apart from the others that it may be well to learn, by an extract from a report made in 1898, how it estimated the results of its efforts:

"The Unitarian Mission has been a unique experiment, and in so far as it has been faithful to its original purpose, it has achieved an almost dramatic success. In its inception it was a frank departure from the customary aim and method of foreign missionary work. It was commissioned 'not to convert but to confer.' The great Christian missionary societies have always gone to work in a spirit of patronage. They have regarded non-Christian people as the Hebrew prophets regarded the idolators of Edom and Moab. They have taken literally the Scriptural injunction, 'Go preach, to all nations repentance.' Our Mission has proclaimed a new missionary motive. It has sought to discover the good in all existing forms of faith. It has recognised the underlying sympathy in all religions, and emphasised unities rather than diversities. It has wrought in the spirit of Paul in his great missionary speech at Athens, proclaiming the unknown God already ignorantly worshipped, using the existing symbols and the sayings of local poets to reinforce the new message. Our Mission has not tried to free men from one superstition by inviting them into another superstition. It has refrained from arrogance and taunt of error, but with respect for all that is good in the Japanese systems of thought and faith, it has invited friendly conference and co-operation, and acquainted thinking Japanese with the adaptability of liberal Christianity to the spiritual needs of the lusty empire. If it has done no more than to show that Christianity also means kindliness, courtesy, and sympathy toward a foreign people and faith, it has served a good purpose; but besides this it has done a work of great practical value and attracted the attention, sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile, of many of the best minds in Japan. The expense of conducting this unique experiment has decreased more rapidly than is usually the case with our home missionary work Five years ago the Japan Mission cost over $10,000 annually; last year, without suffering any appreciable loss in efficiency, it cost a little more than half that sum; next year its activities will be entirely supported by the income of the Hayward fund, which, under the terms of the bequest, must be spent for foreign missions, the only charge upon the unrestricted income of the Association being the salary of the director."

The new treaties made with Western nations permitted the citizens of those countries to travel and reside in any part of Japan after July, 1899. Many of the Japanese had exaggerated ideas about the number of persons that would avail themselves of this privilege. The Buddhists became very much excited over the dangers that confronted them in the coming of so many persons not of their religion. Buddhist magazines abounded with appeals to the people not to be led away by the foreigners. In at least one section of the country prominent priests visited all the cities and towns to hold "preparation meetings" in anticipation of the coming invasion. The burden of the speeches was "Resist the foreign religion," and an old custom was revived requiring that a man who moved into a community should present a document from a temple in his former residence certifying that he was not a follower of the "evil way."

The new conditions did indeed favour the entrance of missionaries into the interior, for residence there was no longer conditioned on their being in the employ of Japanese. The doing away with the necessity for passports permitting travel seemed like the removal of fetters that had impeded freedom of movement. In reality, most of the annoyances connected with the passports had been ended by the Government as soon as the revised treaties were signed \(1894\) and without waiting for the time when they came into effect.

In August, 1899, the Government issued regulations concerning private schools. One article declared that "A private school, unless it is qualified to serve as a substitute for a public school, shall not have the right to admit a child of school-going age who has not discharged his educational obligations." This, as at first interpreted, would have led to the exclusion from Christian schools of all children under fourteen years of age. As a consequence, a number of primary schools were discontinued. After many interviews with officials, some others were allowed to continue under certain conditions.

More troublesome was the following "Instruction" issued by the Educational Department on the same day with the above regulations: "It being essential from the point of view of educational administration that general education should be independent of religion, religious instruction must not be given or religious ceremonies performed at Government Schools, Public Schools, or schools whose curricula are regulated by provisions of law, even outside the regular course of instruction."

Many Christian schools had found it desirable to secure recognition from the Department of Education, as this made it possible for their graduates to enter the national colleges and universities, and in some cases for their pupils to postpone the time of military service. All this must now be given up, or else religious teaching and worship must be discontinued. A committee of Japanese and foreigners, representing the leading Christian schools, presented a memorial to the Minister of Education, and held interviews with prominent men. The secular press for the most part condemned the action of the Department. The regulations for private schools were soon so far relaxed that so-called "special schools" of primary grade could obtain licenses and were given full liberty for religious teaching. It was also decided that the "Instructions" should be so interpreted that, by considering the dormitories as distinct from the schools, religious instruction could be given in the former. This was so unsatisfactory to most of the higher institutions that they gave up their connection with the national system.

It should be noticed that the regulations affected Buddhist as well as Christian schools. It was the policy of the Government to favour a complete divorce between education and religion. Another evidence of the Government's desire to treat all religions alike was shown in a notification that was issued from the Home Department to persons engaged in religious propagandism. It prescribed rules to be observed by those seeking permission from local officials to erect "a house for religious uses, a church, a lecture-hall, or a preaching-place." This was equivalent to putting Christianity on a basis similar to that on which other religions stood, and in accordance with this policy the Government presented to Parliament a bill for the regulation of religions, which, as we shall see, gave great offence to Buddhists.

The *Fukuin Maru* \(Gospel Ship\), a schooner of sixty-eight tons register that had been presented by a Scotch ship-owner to the American Baptist Missionary Union, was dedicated September 13, 1899, and at once set forth under the charge of Captain Luke W. Bickel to carry the Gospel message to the many islands scattered through the Inland Sea. It soon proved itself an efficient instrument for reaching many communities whose separation from the main land had hitherto prevented their evangelisation, A report that apparently covers a period of not more than three or four months, tells of visits to thirteen islands, and says;

"These islands contain a population of 110,000 souls distributed among 123 towns and villages, 113 of which we have been able to reach by tract distributing, small talks, and public meetings. In these places we have held upward of fifty prearranged public meetings with an attendance of 150 to 500 per meeting. In addition, about sixty small meetings in farm yards, on the beach, in small factories, have been held with an attendance of about fifteen to fifty at a meeting. . . . Among these 113 places we have found one in which, on one occasion, a Gospel address has been given. We have found one believer and heard of one more. We have met certainly not more than fifty persons among the thousands with whom we have come in personal contact who have ever heard a Gospel address or received a tract. Out of the thirteen islands we have reached, eleven were last visited by a foreigner in 1869, when the islands were temporarily surveyed."\*

As has already been noted, Japan had tried to regulate the social evil by licensing courtesans and houses of ill-fame. New regulations, issued in 1896, required that "a woman who wishes to become a courtesan must send in a written petition for license to the police station having jurisdiction." This petition was to be accompanied by "a document of consent signed and sealed by the applicant's father or mother, or by her nearest relative if she is an orphan. The paper must state the period of service contracted for and the amount of money received as a loan."

Although this made the act nominally that of the girl herself, and though the money received from the brothel keeper was styled a loan to be paid back from her earnings, the reality was that she was sold by her parents, or other relatives, into the most debasing slavery. Moreover, while a term of service was mentioned in the document, the girls were kept in debt so that their slavery continued so long as they were profitable to their owners.

We have recorded the agitation that for a while had beers vigorously conducted against this system by the Christians. Unfortunately the movement was shortlived, and in only two prefectures was the licensing system abolished. In 1899 a new movement in a city that was a stronghold of the evil began to attract attention. Rev. U. G. Murphy, of the Methodist Protestant Mission, who resided in Nagoya, had noticed in the local papers several items that told of prostitutes who had attempted to escape from their masters, but had been captured and returned by the police. Enquiry showed him that it was almost impossible for a girl to obtain her freedom, however much she might detest the life that she was leading. He was not able to find a single case where the girl had been able to pay her debts, and it was considered that so long as anything was due she was bound by contract to continue the business.. The prefectural laws recognised the validity of the contracts by providing that a girl could not go away until her master gave consent. While still looking up these facts, Mr. Murphy's attention was accidentally called to the following sections of the new civil code of 1898:

"Majority is attained at twenty years of age."

"Legal acts having for their object that which is contrary to public order or morality are invalid."

It was decided to test the possibility of securing through these articles a decision in favour of prostitutes who wished to escape. With considerable care a girl was selected who sent to the police a notification that she wished to cease business from a certain date. The police found an excuse for not receiving it, and in later proceedings they put various obstacles in the way of the reformers. When an appeal was made to the courts, the keepers of the brothels united in choosing a committee to oppose the girl's release. The powerful influence of the Buddhist temples—for Nagoya was a stronghold of Buddhism as of vice—was enlisted on their side. When the court ordered that the girl be set at liberty, the police refused to enforce the order, since, though based on national laws, it was contrary to local regulations; and their position was approved by the Governor of the prefecture. While the attention of the Central Government was being called to this strange action, further proceedings were made impossible by the poor girl's yielding to a deceptive compromise proposed by the keeper.

Soon after this a girl ran away from Nara and sought refuge in the house of a pastor in Nagoya. One day, when she was at Mr. Murphy's house to meet persons interested in her case, she was kidnapped and forced into a *jinrikisha,* which with one man to pull and two to push it, hurried away. When Mr. Murphy was called, he rushed out of the house as he was, bareheaded and with slippered feet, jumped on a bicycle, and gave chase. He soon caught up with the *jinrikisha*, but was unable to get possession of the girl because of eight or ten men who opposed him. Notwithstanding the attempt of the men to hold him back, he followed on until he came to a policeman, who took the whole party to the police station. The girl was then allowed to return with Mr. Murphy. Afterwards she was sentenced to ten days' imprisonment for running away from her keeper, a sentence that on appeal was reduced to a fine of one *yen*, Her former master thought it best not to make further trouble and the girl thus obtained her freedom.

Other cases soon followed. The newspapers throughout the country began to discuss the questions involved. The *Mainichi Shimbun,* one of the leading journals of Tokyo, became an earnest advocate for the removal of restrictions upon prostitutes who wished to obtain their freedom, and its editor in other ways took an active part in the campaign that followed. The agitation reached its height in 1900. The Supreme Court decided that, if local regulations made the brothel-keeper's signature necessary to a prostitute's declaration of her desire to leave him, he must accede to her demand that he affix it. In some cases mobs prevented the escape of girls or assailed those that tried to help them. A Japanese pastor in Shizuoka was for this reason severely beaten, and some blows fell upon a missionary who tried to shield him. Two homes for the reception of the refugees were opened. One was under the care of the Salvation Army, which, in order to let the girls of Tokyo know what was being done in their behalf, sent into the prostitute quarters a detachment of its followers to distribute tracts and to urge all who wished to lead a better life to come to the headquarters of the Army. The brothel-keepers hired a company of roughs, who attacked these crusaders and wounded some of them. Persons connected with newspapers were also assaulted, so that it was said to be dangerous for any person who looked as though he might be a newspaper correspondent or a Salvationist to go into those sections of the city. The office of a paper that had favoured the liberation movement was attacked by a mob that destroyed much of its property. Some who had been patrons of the brothels had their consciences quickened or their fears aroused; for it is said that for a time there was an average decrease of over two thousand *per noctem* in the number of visitors to the prostitute quarters of Tokyo.

The intervention of the Plome Department was sought by both the reformers and their opponents, the victory finally resting with the former. A set of regulations was issued by which all it was necessary for a girl to do was to make a statement, written or verbal, to the police that she wished to cease from her trade. In the case of minors, the parents or guardians might make the request, even against the wishes of the girls, and they must then be set free. Severe penalties were decreed for any interference with the liberty of the girls. Statistics that were official in forty-one out of forty-seven prefectures, showed the following changes in the number of licensed prostitutes.  



1896
> > > 39,097
1897
> > > 47,055    \(20 per cent. increase\)
1898
> > > 50,553    \(7.7 " " "\)
1899
> > > 52,274    \(3 " " "\)
1901
> > > 40,195    \(23 " " decrease\)
The statistics for 1900 were not collated. Doubtless various causes combined to produce the change shown in 1901; but prominent among them must be those connected with the agitation and with the new regulations. It must be remembered that the figures given above include only the licensed prostitutes. In addition, there were about 30,000 *geisha,* many of whom differed but little from those of the other class. There were also many unlicensed prostitutes. Statements concerning their probable numbers have greatly varied, prejudices in favour of the licensing system or against it having doubtless affected the estimates. It was asserted by many that the freeing of the courtesans would increase the amount of immorality; but the arrests for illegal prostitution showed a decrease of twenty per cent, from 1899 to 1901. Doubtless many of the unlicensed prostitutes were held by masters under much the same system as were those that were licensed; and the knowledge of what was being done by the latter class encouraged the former to break away.

It is noteworthy that, as in the former movement against the licensing system, most of the Buddhist papers and leaders set themselves against the reformers. An example of this was seen in a grand campaign in behalf of Buddhism that was conducted in some of the provinces by "The Great Association for Honouring the Emperor and Preserving Buddhism," whose organisation has previously been mentioned. Interspersed among addresses explaining Buddhist doctrines and denouncing Christianity were others bearing such titles as "The Sinfulness of the Salvation Army's Crusade against Licensed Prostitution," "Is the Salvation Army a Lantern-carrier \[helper\] to Secret Prostitution" "The Immorality of Allowing Licensed Prostitutes freely to Stop their Business," etc. While such action might help to retain the favour of brothel-keepers, who in some places were liberal contributors to the temples, it did much to discredit Buddhism in the minds of those who desired the purification of public morals.

In 1900 the Buddhists were much excited over what was known as the "Bill concerning Religions," which the Government had proposed the preceding year to Parliament. This was based on the legislation found in some German states, and was framed in a liberal spirit. It placed Christianity on an equality with Buddhism and Shintoism. This was directly contrary to the movement inaugurated by a large section of Buddhists, who hoped to get their own system recognised as the state religion. In Tokyo, and other cities, mass-meetings were held to protest against the passage of the bill. Objection was made, not only because it put all religions on the same footing, but also because it lessened the authority of the main temples over their branches. This would make it more difficult for the former to raise funds from their subordinates. The Eastern Division of the great Shin sect, which was burdened by a large debt, was a leader in the agitation, while the Western Division supported the bill. It was commonly believed, and by one party within its own fold was openly charged, that the Eastern Division spent large sums of money in bribing members of the Upper House and so succeeded in preventing the passage of the bill.

The general tendency of thought seemed at this time to become more favourable to Christianity. This was in part because of the reproach that Buddhism was bringing upon itself by opposition to the Bill concerning Religions and to reform movements, and in part was due to a growing conviction that, at least for the common people, some religious belief was necessary in order to prevent moral deterioration. There was a marked advance in the circulation of the Scriptures; the number of Bibles, Testaments, and "portions" distributed in 1900, being 137,422 copies, an increase of 39,000 over that of the preceding year. Very few of these were given away. It may be noticed in passing that Japan was becoming a centre for the multiplication of copies of the Scriptures; editions in the Chinese, Korean, and Thibetan languages and in two dialects of the Philippine Islands, being printed at this time in Japan.

In the Japanese army, one hundred and fifty-five officers, or about three per cent, of the whole number, were known as Christians. In the navy, the two 12,500 ton battle-ships, the largest with one exception of those then in commission, were at the beginning of 1900 under the command of Christians, One of these, Rear Admiral Serata, died in the summer. He had for many years been known as an active Christian. When on shore duty in Tokyo, he had not only taught classes in the Sunday school, but he also had on Saturday afternoons in his own house, a class of young men, whom he instructed in Christian truth. He was President of the Tokyo Young Men's Christian Association. On naval cruises, when his vessel touched at different ports, he would go with other Christian officers to hunt up any church that could be found, and his public addresses given in such places often gave great encouragement to little companies of believers and called the attention of the citizens to a religion that they had hitherto thought beneath their notice. He was much interested in Biblical and theological studies. The Gospel of John had been his favourite book, and it is said that his knowledge of it was far beyond that of most preachers. When stationed at Weihaiwei at the close of the war with China, he gave much of his leisure to a study of Canon Gore's book on "The Incarnation of the Son of God." His funeral under the auspices of the Navy Department was conducted with Christian rites, the arrangements being given into the care of Vice-Admiral Uryu, a life-long friend and a fellow-Christian.

In January, 1900, a convention of those interested in Christian schools was held in Tokyo, one hundred and thirty-eight persons being present. The chief interest centred about the question of religious instruction in mission schools. The policy of the Educational Department was declared to be unjust and contrary to the spirit of the National Constitution. It was not very long, however, before the Department so changed the regulations that private schools which in the judgment of the Minister maintained a standard equal to that of a national "middle school" could obtain for their students a postponement of military service, while their graduates could be admitted to examination for the "higher schools" on the same terms as those of government institutions. Thus were done away the disabilities that had rested on those schools that, on account of religious instruction, were unable to affiliate themselves with the national system.

Some of the Christian Endeavour Societies organised after the visit of Rev. F. E. Clark, D.D., in 1892, had ceased to exist, and others manifested but little activity. A second visit of Dr. Clark in 1900 gave the movement renewed life and led to its more perfect organisation. Since then, the annual conventions of the national society have been more fully attended, and the monthly mazagine that serves as an official organ has by its increased circulation helped to make the local societies more effective.

In March, 1900, Rev. Clay MacCauley, D.D., who had for some time been the only representative of the Unitarian Mission, committed the work to the Japanese adherents and returned to America. In a farewell address, after contrasting the spirit of the Unitarians with that of others, he said:

"We are the first to leave the country on account of action taken by the Japanese. They have entered upon an autonomous commercial and practical life, and we have urged them to another life also autonomous—an autonomous religious life. And I think such a life growing out of the people themselves will be permanent because it is of the people and not from without, and that it will grow and prosper."\*

The income from a fund in America continued to be used for the sustenance of the work at Unity Hall, and the support of a Japanese superintendent. The organisation that had been effected was not considered a church, but rather an association of persons who, belonging to any church or to none, were united by similar sentiments and aspirations. Their interest was more in matters connected with social and ethical reforms than in those that were distinctively religious.

The Third General Conference of Protestant Missionaries in Japan was held October 24-31, 1900, in the hall of the Tokyo Young Men's Christian Association. Nearly four hundred missionaries residing in Japan were present, besides some fifty from China and other countries. Rev. J. D. Davis, D.D., was the Chairman; Rev. W. Andrews, Rev. W. Imbrie, D.D., and Rev. D. S. Spencer, being the Vice-Chairmen. In addition to papers and discussions by missionaries, Hon. Ando Taro spoke on the subject of temperance, Mr. Hara Taneaki concerning work for ex-convicts, and Hon. Shimada Saburo on the movement in favour of abolishing licensed prostitution. Among the resolutions of permanent interest were one recommending missionaries to co-operate with the Japanese in special evangelistic efforts to be made in connection with the opening of the twentieth century, one providing for the appointment of a committee to decide on a uniform translation of about one hundred of the most important hymns, and a series upon the subject of union and co-operation. As these last led to considerable discussion and to the appointment of an important committee, they may be quoted in full;

"1. This Conference of Missionaries assembled in the city of Tokyo proclaims its firm belief that all those who are one with Christ by faith are one body; and it calls upon all who love the Lord Jesus and His Church in sincerity and truth to pray and to labour for the full realisation of such corporate oneness as the Master Himself prayed for on that night in which He was betrayed.

"2. Whereas, while this Conference gratefully recognises the high degree of harmony and cordial co-operation which has marked the history of Protestant missions in Japan, it is at the same time convinced that the work of evangelisation is often retarded by an unhappy competition, especially in the smaller fields, and by the duplication of machinery which our present arrangements involve; therefore

"3. Resolved, that this Conference elect upon the nomination of the President and Vice-Presidents a promoting committee of ten whose duty it shall be to prepare a plan for the formation of a representative Standing Committee of the Missions, such plan to be submitted to the various missions for their approval and to go into operation as soon as approved by such a number of missions as include in their membership not less than two-thirds of the Protestant missionaries in Japan."

Great harmony prevailed throughout the Conference; but the discussions were full, frank, and earnest. A report of the proceedings was afterwards published with extensive supplements, the resulting volume being invaluable for those studying the history of Protestant missions in Japan, and for those who wish to know how the missionaries at the close of the nineteenth century looked upon the questions that were then claiming their attention.

### THE OPENING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY   1901-1903





ALTHOUGH the system of dating years from the birth of Christ had not become common even among the Christians of Japan, so much was said in Western journals about the transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth century that the Japanese could not fail to be affected by the thought that a new chapter in the world's history was being opened. In Great Britain and America various forms of religious activity were inaugurated under the name of "twentieth century forward movements," and we have already seen that the Conference of Protestant Missionaries, held in Tokyo, had recommended co-operation with the Japanese Christians in special evangelistic efforts to be begun in 1901. A committee was chosen by the missionaries to join with one appointed by the Japanese Evangelical Alliance in making the necessary arrangements. While most of the churches and Christian workers united in the movement, those commonly known as "liberal" were excluded by the rules that the Alliance adopted. These rules led to considerable criticism, not only by those that held liberal views, but also by some others who thought it unwise to shut out any that were willing to join such efforts as were proposed. Some of the methods adopted were either new or had hitherto been used only by such organisations as the Salvation Army. It was necessary in the first place to prepare the Christians by arousing their zeal and securing their active participation in the movement; then public attention had to be secured and the people brought together that they might hear the Gospel. In the neighbourhood of the place where meetings were to be held, striking placards were posted to advertise the services. Notices of the meetings were inserted in the newspapers and special letters of invitation were sent to persons that were thought most open to Christian influences, Sometimes there was a house to house visitation. For an hour or two before a meeting was to commence, companies of believers marched through the streets, carrying banners and lanterns, singing Christian hymns, and distributing printed invitations to the meeting. The younger members of the church were the most active in these processions; but pastors, evangelists, missionaries, business men, and others did not consider it beneath their diginity to fall into the ranks and take a part in gathering an audience. Whether or not those critics were right who thought these methods led people of the better class to despise Christianity, and so did as much harm as good, it is certain that Christianity once more secured the attention which it had largely lost and that large audiences were gathered. Though some had feared that only a noisy rabble would be brought together, the audiences listened quietly to what was said and the meetings were seldom disturbed in any way. The addresses were usually simple and direct. Many preachers who had before delighted in giving learned dissertations upon themes that perhaps had but slight relations to Christ's teaching now found out the power that there is in the earnest and plain teaching of the Gospel, Near the close of each meeting, those that were willing to express a desire to learn more about the Christian religion were asked to sign papers giving their names and residences. These papers were distributed among the churches so that the persons might be visited in their homes. It was customary to have a second service for those that wished to remain after the large audience had been dismissed. It must be remembered that a large proportion of those brought into the meetings had hitherto heard little or nothing of Christianity, and so these second meetings were much different from those that are held after evangelistic services in Christian lands. Many of those that remained did so from curiosity or with but very slight thought of Christianity as having personal claims upon them. Many, too, of those that signed the papers had no eager desire for further information. It was unfortunate that the use of the words "enquirers" or "seekers" for such persons led many in Christian lands and some in Japan itself to have exaggerated ideas of what was being accomplished. In Tokyo, after a campaign of about six weeks, the number of those enrolled as "converts and seekers" was over five thousand. Reports for the whole country were not obtained, but the statistics of this "forward movement" for the year 1901 showed that, so far as the efforts of 376 churches were concerned, there had been an attendance of 322,245 at the meetings, with 15,440 enquirers and converts,\* and 1,181 baptisms.

The indirect benefits of this movement were many. It gave new courage to the Christians, it led them to more activity than they had been manifesting in recent years, and it increased the spirit of Christian unity by leading those of different denominations to work together to an extent hitherto unknown. Some of the methods adopted were either in their original forms, or with such modifications as experience suggested, used afterwards in other evangelistic movements. In some places the Buddhists were aroused to imitate in this, as they had in so many other things, the methods used by the Christians.

The general evangelistic movement of this period was helped by two workers from America. One of these was Mr. J. L. Mott, who, as on his former visit in 1896, exerted a strong influence upon students. In Tokyo, among other audiences, he had one of eight hundred students belonging to the Imperial University, eighty-four of whom declared their purpose to follow Christ. The method usually pursued by Mr. Mott was first to address a general audience of students upon some subject that led the way for speaking of their need of power that would help them to meet temptation and live righteous lives. Those that wished to learn more specifically of the way such power could be gained through Christ were asked to remain for a second meeting. After another earnest address, those that were ready to declare a desire and purpose to become disciples of Christ, taking Him as their personal Saviour and Lord, were asked to raise their hands. After the meaning of this declaration had been carefully explained, cards were passed to receive the names of those that still wished to make it. In order that a third meeting might be held with these alone, other persons were then dismissed. It will be seen that great care was taken that none should give in their names without knowing what was expected of them. Most of these students had in other ways heard more or less about Christianity, so that its teachings were not wholly new to them. At the eighteen meetings held in different educational centres, 1,464 persons signed the cards. In each city a committee was chosen to look after these enquirers, to get them into Bible classes and in other ways to follow up the work. In addition to direct evangelistic services, Mr, Mott gave in the halls of several national high schools an address on "The Influence of Christianity among the Students of All Lands." It is said that he was the first distinctively religious worker invited to speak in the Imperial University at Tokyo. Early in 1902, Rev, R. A. Torrey spent a short time in Japan. He also led many persons to express their determination to be Christians. Both of these workers, and others that came after them, accomplished much permanent good; yet it is easy to be misled by the numerical reports of converts and enquirers. Speaking through interpreters to audiences having but very dim conceptions of a personal God and unaccustomed to put into the Japanese terms any such meanings as the speakers had in mind when they used the English words "sin," "salvation," "repentance," and "holiness," it is not strange that these evangelists, who often held but one or two meetings in a city, failed to attain results commensurate with the hopes raised in their minds by the large number of cards signed by their auditors. In following up the supposed converts, it was found that many of those that signed cards were already members of churches, some had given false names and addresses that could not be found, and some others were not thoroughly in earnest. One disappointing feature was that many of those students that had apparently been honest in signing the cards were unwilling to have anything to do with churches, pastors, evangelists, or other Christians. Sometimes in a school where there was a Young Men's Christian Association, they were disinclined to identify themselves openly with Christianity by joining that organisation. Losing the help that would come through association with fellow-believers and the instruction of older Christians, they made little if any advance in the religious life. Apparently they had been attracted more by the personality of the men whose addresses had interested them than by the Christ whom the speakers proclaimed. Hence it was that afterwards when enquiries were made about these persons, the reply would be given: "Oh, he is a Mott Christian," or, "He is a Torrey Christian." In writing these things there is no desire to overlook the great good that was done by Messrs. Mott, Torrey, and others; but it is necessary to recognise that their failure to appreciate the readiness of the Japanese to sign cards or make other signs of consenting to what was urged by effective speakers, led them to give readers of their reports exaggerated ideas of what had been accomplished. Missionaries that had long lived in the country were also misled at first by the large numbers of those that signed cards. This method of trying to keep in touch with those influenced by evangelistic services had been used but little before the inauguration of the "Forward Movement," and the hesitation formerly shown by the Japanese about doing anything that might connect them with the Christian religion led to the supposition that only those thoroughly in earnest would go so far as to give in their names, even though it were only as an expression of desire for further instruction.

Disinclination to join a church was not uncommon among young men who yet considered themselves believers. While in most cases this may have been a sign of a lack of religious earnestness, it would be unfair to say that it was always so. One of the most popular Christian writers, who exerted what was in many respects a helpful influence upon young men, was a person of such a temperament as made it difficult for him to work with others, A sharp critic of what he believed to be defects in the churches, he held himself aloof from them and advised others to do the same. The national characteristics of the Japanese often incline them to prefer the position of free lances or lead them to break away from an organisation when there is anything connected with it that is not in accord with their own desires.

In the period covered by this chapter there were visits by other evangelists from abroad; such as Rev. G. F. Pentecost, D.D.; Rev, F. Franson; Rev. Grattan Guinness, D.D.; and others. There also arose among the Japanese themselves a class of evangelists who, by combining their knowledge of foreign methods with that of the language and characteristics of their own people, were fitted to exert a great influence and to achieve good results. One of the first to become prominent in this line of work was Mr. Kimura Seimatsu. He had spent several years in America, where he came under D. L. Moody's influence and received instruction in the Chicago Bible Institute established by the latter. There were now in the cities where the Gospel had long been proclaimed many persons who had as children been taught in Sunday schools, or who had in other ways learned about Christ, but who had never made a definite decision to be His followers; and it was among such persons that these evangelists could do their most effective work by leading them to make an open profession of their desire to be disciples of Christ. Others to whom the message was new were also attracted to the meetings and led to a belief in the truths that were so earnestly proclaimed.

As a part of the general evangelistic movement of this period and as exemplifying some of its methods, mention may be made of the work carried on during a National Exhibition that was held in Osaka from March 1 to July 31, 1903. A committee appointed by the Missionary Association of Central Japan obtained a building that was situated on the open square before the main entrance to the Exhibition. On its roof was placed a large sign with the invitation, "Come and see," while other signs upon the front of the building bore the name "Christian Union Evangelistic Hall," or were inscribed with appropriate passages of Scripture. The lower story contained an audience-room and a stand for the sale of Christian literature. The Japanese churches joined with the missionaries in raising the money required for expenses and in furnishing the necessary workers. The first two weeks the different denominations united in a joint conduct of the meetings, and the same plan was adopted for the last three days of the Exhibition; but the rest of the time was divided between Baptist, Congregationalist, Episcopalian, Methodist, and Presbyterian groups of churches, each being responsible for two periods of a fortnight in length. With slight variations the method adopted was somewhat as follows: in the morning, as soon as the number of people passing through the square made it probable that an audience could be gathered, some of the workers stood before the hall and sang a few hymns, the favourite one and the most effective being set to the stirring tune of "Marching through Georgia." Sometimes a cornet or an accordion added to the volume of sound. By the help of a megaphone an invitation was given to attend the meeting. The floor of the building was on a level with the ground and, as most of the front was open, persons could easily step inside. When a sufficient number had entered, the meeting commenced. In addition to songs, there were two short, pointed addresses, after which papers and pencils were carried through the audience so that those who desired further instruction concerning Christianity might give their names and residences. Tracts were then distributed and the audience dismissed, the whole service having lasted from half to three-quarters of an hour. By that time the number of people in the square had so increased that it usually took only four or five minutes to fill the hall for another meeting. On days when the largest crowds were visiting the Exhibition, there was an almost constant succession of these meetings from nine o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock at night. The audiences were quiet and respectful, there being only two or three occasions when individuals made any objection to what was said. The whole attendance at the Exhibition was about four million, and, as that of the meetings was 246,000, it may be said that about one in sixteen of the visitors had the Gospel preached to him. There must have been many others that stood outside the hall and listened for a few minutes before passing on. Those that wished for personal conversation were invited to meet Christian workers in the second story of the building. Those that signed the papers numbered over sixteen thousand. These included persons from every prefecture, and among them were representatives of nearly all classes of people—farmers, merchants, jinrikisha-pullers, officials, teachers, students, soldiers, and even one nobleman. Christian literature was afterwards mailed to these persons and their names were sent to Christian workers in the districts where they lived. In after years it was not uncommon to hear candidates for baptism say that their first knowledge of Christianity had been gained in the Gospel Hall" at the Osaka Exhibition.

Among the incidents connected with this work is the following as narrated by one of the pastors:

The editor of a magazine published in Osaka "on visiting the Exposition grounds saw near the front gateway in a very prominent place these words: '*Kitarite Miyo,'* 'Come and See.' This was the sign in large letters over the Preaching Hall rented to carry on daily preaching during the five months of the Exposition. He was angered as he saw the sign—so large and conspicuous. Being an unbeliever, if not an atheist, he scarcely knew how to restrain his feelings. 'How dare,' thought he 'these Christians to come right in front of our great Exposition and preach their detestable doctrines?' One day as he was passing in front of the Preaching Hall—crowded inside and outside—he ventured to thrust his head in through the outer row of listeners to see what was going on that so many persons were attracted. Just as he did so, an earnest Japanese—doubtless preaching on the existence of God and trying to show its reasonableness—uttered such words as these: 'The man who refuses to believe in the existence of God is a fool.' So convincing were the evidences in favour of the existence of God in the mind of the speaker that he was led to utter these strong words.

The editor on whose ears fell these words was filled with rage. Without waiting to hear more, in disgust he left for home. But the words of the evangelist kept ringing in his ears. That night he could not dismiss these daring words. They had found a lodgment in his heart. He said: 'I don't believe in God; but, if there should be a God and my soul immortal, then it becomes a serious matter.' 'What if there is a God and my soul immortal?' kept returning to him during the sleepless and restless night. These words would not down. The next day he called on three of the Osaka pastors, but found none of them at home. He then found his way to the Southern Methodist Mission of which the Rev. Mr. Meyers is the head in Osaka. Here he had a. long talk with the pastor or evangelist. He became very serious and penitent. He decided to take the risks no longer. He became an earnest enquirer and gave his name as a candidate for baptism."—*Tidings from Japan,* June, 1903.

The advance made by Christianity in this period was largely due to the growing sense among thinking men of the need that the country had for religion as the basis for morality. Official Shintoism was no longer regarded as a religion. Buddhism was criticised as failing to be a strong ethical force. Some of the Buddhist sects were weakened by internal dissensions. The most powerful of these, the Eastern Division of the Shin sect, was burdened with a heavy debt that was declared by a large portion of its adherents to be due to speculation and to the money squandered on the notoriously immoral pleasures of its Chief Abbot. One of the most prominent men in the country had been asked to make arrangements for saving the sect's property, as it was in danger of being seized by creditors. It was generally understood that one of the conditions under which he would have accepted was that the Abbot would reform his manner of life, but the latter was unwilling to do this. Under such circumstances, the moral influence of Buddhism could not but be greatly weakened. Men that seemed indifferent to their own spiritual condition declared that religion was the great need of the people as a whole. Professor Inoue Tetsujiro, of the Imperial University in Tokyo, who had a great influence as a writer and lecturer on religious and philosophic subjects, declared that both Buddhism and Christianity contained too many superstitious ideas to be acceptable to men of modern times, and so he proposed that learned men unite with him in constructing a new religion that should contain all that was good in others, while having special adaptation to the needs of Japan. Others believed that Buddhism could be reformed and re-vivified. Baron Maejima, who was known as the "Father of the Japanese Postal Service," said: "I firmly believe we must have religion as the basis of our national and personal welfare. No matter how large an army or navy we may have, unless we have righteousness at the foundation of our national existence, we shall fall short of the highest success. I do not hesitate to say that we must rely upon religion for our highest welfare, and when I look about me to see what religion we may best rely on, I am convinced that the religion of Christ is the one most full of strength and promise for the individual and for the nation."\*

The need was felt not only for the lower classes, but also for the students in the higher institutions of learning, of whom it was said that their conduct was far from upright. Baron Kikuchi, at one time President of the Imperial University and afterwards Minister of Education, wrote in a magazine article that there were two books that he recommended to all young men—the New Testament and Smiles's "Self-Help."

The need of Japanese students for religion was emphasised by the prevalence among them of pessimistic views. Early in the twentieth century, the word *"hammon"* became very common in articles and lectures dealing with the condition of young men. The word has been variously translated by such terms as "torment of mind," "anxiety," or "despair." It was brought into common use by its appearance in a writing left by a student of philosophy, who, on account of this torment of mind, committed suicide by throwing himself down a waterfall. The notoriety gained by this young man led to his having many imitators until another student changed the fashion of self-destruction by leaping into the crater of an active volcano. The epidemic of suicide was but an outward symptom of the spiritual unrest and pessimistic feeling that were common among students, and thus it added another proof that a religion of hope, courage, and power was needed by the educated young men of Japan.

Young Men's Christian Associations have been effective instruments for exerting a religious and moral influence upon students. Societies were formed in most of the higher institutions, and these were visited from time to time by secretaries of the national organisation. In some of the educational centres the associations had buildings that afforded opportunities for recreation, literary exercises, and religious services. Christian hostels furnishing board and rooms for students brought them into surroundings calculated to develop their characters and to strengthen them against the temptations that beset young men away from home.

One of the resolutions adopted by the General Conference of Missionaries in 1900 favoured the formation of a representative standing committee of the missions. The committee was duly organised and held its first meeting in January, 1902, It has ever since had such an important part in the joint work of the missions and in matters affecting their mutual relations that it may be well to give the first two articles of its Constitution:—

"article I. Name.

"This Committee shall be called The Standing Committee of Co-operating Missions in Japan.

"article II. Functions.

"\(1\) This Committee shall serve as a general medium of reference, communication, and effort for the co-operating missions in matters of common interest and in cooperative enterprises. On application of interested parties, and in cases of urgent importance on its own initiative, the Committee may give counsel:

"\(a\) With regard to the distribution of forces for evangelistic, educational, and eleemosynary work, especially where enlargement is contemplated;

"\(b\) With regard to plans for union or co-operation on the part of two or more missions for any or all of the above forms of missionary work;

"\(c\) And in general with a view to the prevention of misunderstandings and the promotion of harmony of spirit and uniformity of method among the co-operating missions.

"\(2\) The work of this Committee may include: "\(a\) The formation of plans calculated to stimulate the production and circulation of Christian literature;

"\(b\) The arranging for special evangelistic campaigns, for the services of visitors from abroad as preachers or lecturers, and for other forms of co-operative evangelistic effort;

\(c\) Securing joint action to meet emergencies affecting the common interests of the co-operating missions.

"\(3\) In serving as a means of communication between the co-operating missions the Committee shall be authorised to publish at least once a year a record of social and religious conditions and progress."

It was in accordance with the section last quoted that there has since been published annually a pamphlet entitled "The Christian Movement in Japan," whose successive numbers give a history of the growth of Christianity, and also contain much valuable information upon allied subjects.

Under the general oversight of this Committee arrangements have from time to time been made for lectures by distinguished scholars from Western lands. One of the first of those who came in this way was Dr. Charles Cuthbert Hall, President of Union Theological Seminary, who in 1903 repeated the lectures that he had just given in India on the Haskell Foundation, and that were afterwards published in America as well as in India and Japan.

Another measure favoured by the General Conference of 1900 was the preparation of a union hymnal. Ten years earlier a joint committee of the Kumi-ai \(Congregational\) body and the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\), assisted by the missions with which they were associated, had prepared for the use of these churches a hymn-book which was also used by some of the smaller denominations. In the autumn of 1900 the two churches above mentioned, together with the Baptists, and joined the next year by the Methodists and the Disciples of Christ, began to prepare a new book. It was at one time hoped that the Episcopalians might be willing to co-operate; but they decided not to do so, one reason being that a new hymnal of their own preparation was nearly completed. An arrangement was made, however, by which one hundred and twenty-five of the most common hymns were revised in co-operation with their committee, and these, under the name of "Uniform Hymns," were included in both books. One advantage of this has been that in union meetings there is this large number of hymns that can be drawn upon with the assurance that all have been accustomed to use them in the same form. The union hymnal was completed in 1903, and was at once adopted, not only by the churches directly concerned in its compilation, but by nearly all other Protestant bodies with the exception of the Episcopalians.

Another form of co-operation was that by which a committee representing the Council of Missions \(Presbyterian\), the American Board, the Methodist, and the Baptist Missions united in preparing various publications to be used in connection with the International Sunday School Lessons.

In the summer of 1901 a few Mormons under the leadership of Mr. Heber T. Grant came to Yokohama. They soon became the subject of lively controversies. The English proprietor of a boarding-house much frequented by missionaries refused to receive them as guests. One of the English newspapers published in Yokohama at once attacked him for what it styled his fanaticism, while another upheld him on the ground that his obligations to other guests justified him in shutting out persons who came as representatives of a religion that favoured polygamy. Mr. Grant wrote several articles containing arguments in favour of plural marriage, though declaring that his fellow-believers in the United States had given up the practice because it was prohibited by law. When application was made for official permission to open preaching-places, the request was at first refused on technicalities. Meanwhile, the Mormons and their views concerning marriage had become a subject of discussion among the Japanese, the public press being for the most part strongly opposed to them. Finally, they obtained the Government's consent for the propagation of their religious views; but it is said that this was granted only on condition that polygamy should not be advocated. This restriction was in accordance with the National Constitution, which in the article guaranteeing religious freedom restricts this to "limits not prejudicial to peace and order."

A few items may here be inserted to show the liberal treatment that the Japanese Government was now ready to accord to Christianity.

One of the regulations of the Home Department forbade any general collection of money for religious purposes without its permission. In gathering contributions for the erection of houses of worship the churches had been satisfied to get the consent of the local police offices; and as the needed money was drawn from a limited circle, no trouble was experienced. In 1902, however, after waiting five months for careful enquiry to be made into the history, purpose, financial ability, and doctrines of the church concerned, the Home Minister issued to the pastor and eleven members of the Kumi-ai Church in Wakamatsu a formal document authorising them to raise money for the erection of a Christian church.

Even after the revised treaties came into force, foreigners as individuals were not allowed to own real estate. Nevertheless, a company incorporated under Japanese law, even though made up wholly of foreigners, became a juridical person, and was thus free from this restriction. Up to that time the houses and land that had been bought outside the open ports had of necessity been held in the names of Japanese, In a number of cases these persons had proved untrustworthy, and several missions had suddenly discovered that some of the property had been sold or mortgaged. Even where the original holder was honest, his failure in business made the property liable for his debts, or his death might throw it into the hands of heirs who would take it for themselves. It was now found possible to have a mission or a number of its members incorporated and thus endued with power to hold real estate. When application was made for a charter, documents were required telling the source of the funds held by the company, the doctrines of the denomination it represented, and many other related facts. The purpose for which the property or any income coming from it would be used was also to be carefully stated. For example, in the charter of "The Association of Congregational Missionaries in Japan" \(those of the American Board\) the stated object of the company was "to hold land, buildings, or other property for the extension of Christianity, the carrying on of Christian education, and the performance of works of charity and benevolence." Though the minute regulations governing these associations and the necessity of preparing the many different documents that Japanese officialdom delights in requiring were a source of considerable annoyance, it was a great relief to know that the property was held in the most secure way that could well be devised, while the granting of incorporation after careful examination of creeds and enquiry concerning the relations of the missions to the boards showed how far the country had advanced since "the evil sect called Christian" had been strictly prohibited.

There was also a changed attitude towards Christian schools. The regulations issued by the Department of Education in 1899 had ordered that no religious instruction should be given or religious service held in any institution that shared such privileges as were accorded to national schools. In deference to the representations made by persons connected with Christian institutions, these regulations, though not withdrawn, were modified by others, and in 1903 licenses giving most of the desired privileges were granted to several of these schools. Even theological schools of sufficiently high grade found it possible to obtain formal recognition as "special schools," so that their students shared with others such advantages as the postponement of military service.

Only a change in the feeling of the Government towards Christianity would have permitted the bestowal of the badge of the Blue Ribbon, in 1902, upon Mr. Ishii Juji in recognition of his work as founder and superintendent of the Okayama Orphanage, which was everywhere known as a Christian institution.

While the limits of this history do not permit extended notices in connection with the death of prominent Christians, an exception may well be made in the case of Hon. Kataoka Kenkichi, who died October 31, 1903.

He was born December, 1843, in the province of Tosa, which was one of those that a quarter of a century later took an important part in overthrowing the Shogunate and restoring the Imperial power. In the struggles connected with that movement he was in command of one-half of the Tosa troops. In 1871 he was one of ten young men that were sent abroad for study. They went to America under the care of Rev. David Thompson, a Presbyterian missionary. In an account that Mr. Kataoka gave of his own life\* he says that in that country he was deeply impressed by the philanthropic institutions and by the Christian homes. The latter seemed to him to present a strong contrast to those of his own land because their governing spirit was love instead of propriety. From America he went to England, where he spent a little more than one year. After his return to Japan he was for a while in the navy, and there attained the rank of lieutenant-commander. The politicians of Tosa took a leading part in the agitation for constitutional government, and Mr. Kataoka became the trusted lieutenant of Mr. Itagaki, the leader of what afterwards became the Liberal Party. In 1877, at the time of the Satsuma Rebellion, he was suspected of plotting with its promoters and was imprisoned for one hundred days. While in prison he became very much interested in reading Dr. Martin's Chinese work on Christian evidences that has elsewhere been mentioned as being widely read by Japanese.

Mr. Kataoka joined the Presbyterian Church in Kochi, Tosa, in May, 1885, and soon afterwards was chosen to the eldership, an office that he continued to hold until his death. In 1887 he went with a number of his political associates to Tokyo for the purpose of petitioning for various reforms, especially for freedom of speech and of the press, At least one other of this delegation was a Christian. Suddenly the Government issued Regulations for the Preservation of the Peace," and in connection with these the petitioners were ordered to leave the city at once. Mr. Kataoka and some others declared that their consciences would not allow them to yield to what they considered tyrannical action; they had come in a peaceful manner to present their petition; for them to depart now would cause the object of their coming to be misunderstood. As a result of this refusal they were arrested and imprisoned for several months. An account of their experiences in prison has been given in a previous chapter. On the day of the promulgation of the National Constitution, February 11, 1889, political prisoners were released, and the next year Mr. Kataoka was elected a member of the first Parliament. His refusal to help his political prospects by resigning his office in a Christian church has already been related. He was four times chosen Speaker of the Lower House, and held that office at the time of his death. He had hoped to withdraw from political life in order to give himself more completely to the duties of the presidency of the Doshisha, an office that he had taken in 1902, but circumstances were such as to make him feel that until a certain important crisis had been passed he could not honourably refuse the appeals of his party that he retain the speakership. Throughout the severe suffering that attended his last illness He found Christ the source of strength and comfort. Just before the end came he asked his wife, children, grandchildren, and pastor, who were all standing at his bedside, to sing his favourite hymn, a translation of

"Jesus, Thy love, it cheers my heart."

"A verse may find him who a sermon flies," and a religions story may attract the attention of those that would not read an apologetic treatise. Among the Christians there had for some time been those who as editors of newspapers or writers for magazines were helping to give a Christian tinge to national thought, even when discussing subjects not directly connected with religion. More and more, Christians began to become prominent in other departments of literature. In 1902 a newspaper in Tokyo received twenty-six hundred poems in competition for prizes that it had offered. Of the forty that were selected as the most worthy, more than half were written by Christians, and to them went the three highest prizes. Those that tried to account for this remarkable result were inclined to explain it by saying that the religion of the writers had helped to inspire them with fresh and lofty thoughts. In 1901 a novel that attracted much attention to itself and to Christianity was likewise drawn out by the offer of a prize, coming in this case from a newspaper published in Osaka. The successful competitor was Mr, Nakamura Kichizo, whose novel "Ichijiku" \(The Figtree\) has for its heroine an American lady married to a Japanese evangelist who after a time falls into sin and leaves the ministry. By her Christian life and deeds she leads him to repentance and also wins the hearts of her parents-in-law, who at first had done their best to make her life miserable. A skilful novelist is able to enlist the sympathies of his readers for one that is in sorrow or unjustly treated, and the daily instalments of this story were eagerly awaited by those that had become interested in the heroine and had shed many tears over the sad position in which she found herself. The story has frequent quotations from the Bible, and when issued in book form it was preceded by Christ's parable of the Barren Figtree, while the cover was embellished with a large gilt cross.

About the same time Mr. Tokutomi Kenjiro published "Omoide no Ki" \(Reminiscences\). This tale, which is thought to be founded on the author's own experiences, is largely occupied with the religious perplexities of a young student whose faith in Christ finally becomes firmly established. The book quickly passed through many editions and helped to establish Mr. Tokutomi's position as one of the leading writers of Japan. He and Mr. Nakamura did not stand alone, but were followed by others who, by means of their stories, have helped to remove prejudice against Christianity, and to make its teachings more widely known.

### JAPAN IN WAR AND IN PEACE 1904-1909 

IN February, 1904, Japan again found herself engaged in war; this time with one of the nations of Christendom. Among some of the Buddhists there was at first an inclination to utilise the enmity of the people against Russia as a means for exciting a similar feeling against Christianity; but this attempt met little encouragement, being frowned upon by the Government and by leaders of national thought, who saw how important it was that Japan should preserve the good opinion and, if possible, have the moral support of Western nations, especially of England, with which it was in alliance, and of America, whose friendship at such a time would be of great value. It was doubtless such reasons that led Count Katsura, the Prime Minister, to invite a missionary, Rev. W. M. Imbrie, D.D., to call upon him and hear some things that it was desirable to have brought to the attention of the people of America, whither the missionary was about going on a furlough. The interview lasted nearly two hours, and the account that Dr. Imbrie wrote of it was afterwards submitted to the Prime Minister for his certification to its correctness. Among other things Count Katsura said in combating the arguments that Russia would be likely to use in seeking to prejudice Americans in her favour were the following:

"The argument against Japan is sometimes put in this form; Russia stands for Christianity and Japan stands for Buddhism. The truth is that Japan stands for religious freedom. In Japan a man may be a Buddhist, a Christian, or even a Jew, without suffering for it That is a principle embodied in her Constitution; and her practice is in accordance with that principle. There are Christian churches in every large city and in almost every large town in Japan; and all have complete freedom to teach and worship in accordance with their own convictions. There are numerous Christian newspapers and magazines which obtain their licenses precisely as other newspapers and magazines; and as a matter of course, Christian schools, some of them conducted by foreigners and some by Japanese, are found everywhere. . . . Japanese Christians are not confined to any one rank or class. They are to be found among the members of the National Diet, the judges in the courts, the professors in the universities, the editors of leading secular papers, and the officers of the army and navy. Therefore, to say that Japan stands for religious freedom is simply to say what is patent to all; and to abandon that principle, either now or in the future, would be to violate the Constitution, and would create deep dissatisfaction throughout all Japan. What then becomes of the argument that japan stands for Buddhism?"\*

Rev. Honda Yoitsu, who had a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Minister of War to present a request of the Japan Evangelical Alliance for the appointment of Christian chaplains to the army, was asked to convey to the churches a message from the former official in which he said:

"At the commencement of the war with Russia one subject, which gave me no small anxiety, was the danger of misconception and confusion of thought arising from racial and religious differences, and the dissemination of opinions calculated to foster mutual recriminations between the people of different nationalities and religious beliefs. . . . As I had feared, numerous cases of religious rancour have occurred in different localities, indignities being heaped upon believers of the Greek Church, and even damage done to church property. Moreover, failing to discriminate between one foreigner and another, and between one Christian denomination and another, some have, unfortunately, at sight of a Christian allowed themselves to be filled with feelings of suspicion and distrust, and been guilty of rude behaviour. Such things I deeply deplore. . . . As the present war is one carried on against Russia— a professedly Christian nation—I have felt that redoubled efforts should be made that no unworthy sentiments should be tolerated, that we should adopt a thoroughly unbiassed and equitable attitude toward all, and that the whole nation should give practical effect to the policy so clearly set forth in the Imperial edict that this is a war which has no other object than the safety of the Empire and the peace of the Far East. I sincerely hope that no one will be betrayed into the error of supposing that such things as differences in race or religion have anything whatever to do with the present complication. I had indeed thought of issuing an official instruction on the subject in the near future, but I wish through you to convey to the Christian churches and the foreign missionaries our mind at this time, so that all misgivings and misunderstandings may be prevented."\*

Those high in office were not the only ones desirous of making it evident that the war was not a contest between religions. On May 16, 1904, there was held at Tokyo a meeting of representatives of different religions. The following extract from the call for the meeting shows its purpose:

"It is a matter for much regret to us that there are those abroad who are seeking to alienate from Japan the feeling of the West by representing the war as simply one between races, and in some cases as a conflict in which Russia stands for Christianity and Japan for Buddhism. Equally also it is a cause for regret that instances are reported of an exhibition of anti-foreign spirit on the part of narrow-minded men in Japan, and of a readiness to make use of what presents itself to them as an opportunity to advance by means injurious to others the interests of their own religious faith. These facts lay a special responsibility upon the representative men of all the religions in the Empire. While it is the duty of all such to guide the people in matters of religion and to inculcate love of country in a manner accordant with their own faith and conscience, it is also the duty of all to cultivate the great principles of universal peace and love, not in the interest of any one creed or cult, but rather for the benefit of all men. More particularly they should endeavour to make it clear abroad that the war is not a conflict of race against race or of religion against religion, but one entered, into solely for the rightful interests of Japan; and at home, while using every proper means to bind the whole nation together as one man in its contest to secure an honourable peace, they should be forward in effort to discountenance any spirit of extreme nationalism or of animosity between religions."

Those in attendance at the meetings, numbering about a thousand, included Japanese and foreigners; Shintoists, Buddhists, Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, and Protestants of different denominations. The speeches that were made and the resolutions that were passed were in accord with the sentiments expressed in the call for the meeting.

It was evidently at one time the plan of the Government to permit some Christians to go with the army as chaplains. Count Katsura in his interview with Dr. Imbrie had declared his purpose to do this. For some reason, however, the plan was not put into execution. Instead of this, the Young Men's Christian Association was allowed to enter upon a work in behalf of the soldiers which, though at first looked upon with little favour by some of the military officers, soon gained the approval of the highest authorities, and little by little won over those on the field who in the beginning had regarded it with indifference or suspicion. It was in August, 1904, that permission was finally obtained for the operations of the "Soldiers' Comforting Department of the Young Men's Christian Association Union." One foreign and two Japanese secretaries at once set out for the seat of war. Arriving at Antung, they found that those in command there had received no communication concerning them; their help was not desired, and the foreigner was regarded with great suspicion. The party therefore returned to Chinampho, where the commandant was more favourable and furnished them with rooms in the second story of the building used by the Japanese civil administration. This place soon became a favourite resort for the soldiers. In a few days a telegram called them to Antung, where instructions had at last been received from Tokyo and where they now met a kind reception from the officers, who placed a building at their disposal. It was now the soldiers that were shy and suspicious. Kindness shown to the few that first ventured into the rooms and to the patients in the hospital soon wrought a change, and the rooms became recognised as the most comfortable and indeed the only comfortable place in the city for the soldiers to spend their leisure hours. Visits were made by officers from other posts. Their impression of what was being done and the reports that began to spread abroad about the work were so favourable that it became easy to get permission to begin operations at other military centres. More workers were sent out, most of them being Japanese, as there was more readiness to allow them to go into the territory where war was actually in progress. Some of them travelled about from place to place, visiting the more lonely garrisons or advancing with the army nearly to the fighting line. Some extracts from the published reports will give an idea of the methods that were adopted.

"The plan has been to make the buildings a social, recreational, and religious centre for all troops, supplying everything possible to attract, appeal to, and console the men far from home. The result has been that all classes and conditions of men have been appealed to and have greatly appreciated the benefits received. The work has centred around the reading, correspondence, game, and assembly rooms. There have been for the free use of the men letter-paper, envelopes, postal cards, and writing materials, daily newspapers, monthly magazines, and books of general interest. The gramophones have been the most popular of all attractions, and constant use has been made of organs, accordions, and other simple musical instruments. Among more practical articles have been razors, hair-clippers, and soap, the latter for toilet and laundry purposes. Hot water has been provided, and men by the hundreds have availed themselves of the opportunity to do their own washing. Thousands of buttons of various shapes have been supplied for those which had been lost, and goods for patches have lengthened the life of and made more comfortable many suits of clothing. Pamphlets, tracts, and Scriptures have been distributed in large numbers, generous contributions having been made by the Bible Societies and the Japan Book and Tract Society. Social gatherings, lantern exhibitions, singing clubs, and evening classes have been maintained and attended by multitudes. The religious work has been at no place forced from the start, but the secretaries have been on the constant watch for opportunities to make the beginning. Within three weeks of opening the first Association, a weekly Bible class was begun and attended by seventy men. Within two weeks, at the request of soldiers, the sessions were increased to three per week, all well attended, and the soldiers were asking for more. At every point Bible classes, Gospel, prayer, and enquiry meetings, and personal work have been conducted, comprising a vigorous and constant religious campaign.

"Words can convey no adequate impression of what the Association meant to the men during the winter of 1905 when at both Antung and at Yinkow the harbours were closed for four months. Through the long, cold, dreary winter day the men wrapped in their great-coats and blankets lay crowded on the floor of the great barn-like oilmills that did duty as hospital wards, and then through the longer, drearier, colder winter night with almost no light, they watched through the seemingly endless hours until the morning. Some men died from sheer loneliness and despair, and it was as the surgeons said, that many of the men needed the help of the Association more than they needed medicine. The men who came back from the capture of Mukden weary, many of them with the blood still clotted in their long unkempt hair, found at the Christian Comforting Place for the first time in weeks hot water, soap, barber's implements, and willing hands to help those who could not help themselves; the men who after the fall of Port Arthur and the midwinter march overland toward the front found at the Association much desired writing materials, good cheer, and a touch of home com fort,—none of these men will ever forget the service of the Jesus religion. Hundreds of thousands of men, welcomed and cheered on their return from the front, gave glad testimony to their appreciation with their *'Banzai* for the Y, M. C. A*.'"*

Letters from many military officers of high rank testified to their appreciation of this work, but an endorsement that attracted the attention of the whole country was the gift of ten thousand *yen* received by the Association from the Emperor and Empress. This was made after the officials of the Imperial Household had carefully examined what was being done. Other generous contributions were given by wealthy Japanese merchants.

As we have seen to be the case in so many other movements, the Buddhists paid to the Christians the tribute of imitation. Their efforts were praiseworthy, yet for some reason or other, where their rooms and those of the Christian Associations were in the same city, the latter drew manifold the number of visitors. A Buddhist newspaper said:

"The enormous amount of two hundred thousand *Yen* has been expended by the Shin sect for the work among the soldiers, but it is far inferior to the work of the Christian Association, whose expenditure amounts to only a few thousand *Yen,* The latter's quarters are regarded as a paradise for the soldiers, and the Association is everywhere welcome."

The Young Men's Association was not alone in seeking the material and spiritual welfare of the soldiers. Though its representatives were the only ones permitted as Christian workers to go to the seat of war, others could engage in efforts for troops on their way to the front and for the many sick and wounded that were brought back to Japan. At the railroad stations where the trains conveying soldiers made prolonged stops, Christians, and especially Christian women, joined with others in performing kindly offices, such as serving tea, sewing on buttons, re-arranging bandages, etc. Religious literature was also distributed. Sometimes the pupils of a girls' school or other companies of Christians would sing for the soldiers. In one prominent city when this was done for the first time the prefectural governor, who was on the platform of the railroad station, was so moved that his eyes filled with tears, and it was at his request that copies of the hymns were printed so that on future occasions they might be distributed among the men. The latter were often able to catch the tune sufficiently well to keep on singing as the train bore them on their way. It was pleasant to see that these efforts of the Christians seldom met with any opposition. Often the non-Christian members of the patriotic societies that went to cheer the soldiers would ask for bundles of tracts or hymns that they might help in giving them to the men who were stretching out their hands to receive them. In one place a Buddhist priest sometimes helped in this distribution of Christian literature. Buddhist tracts were also circulated; but they of course had less of novelty for the soldiers, who were therefore much more eager to get those of the Christians, especially when the latter were distributed by a foreign lady.

The most favourable place for Christian work was among the thousands that were brought back to Japan sick or wounded. In many of the hospitals permission was given missionaries and other Christians to go in and out as they pleased during certain hours of the day. The physicians said that they welcomed anything, otherwise unobjectionable, that took the thoughts of the patients away from themselves. Some of the hospitals had large recreation halls where companies of Christians could entertain the soldiers with music or stereopticon exhibitions, and in connection with these entertainments there was usually no objection to addresses on religious subjects. Sometimes the Christian worker would visit the separate wards, and as he got into conversation with individuals he would soon find himself surrounded by most of the occupants of the ward, if they were not too sick to walk, some perhaps hobbling up on crutches, others with heads bandaged, who sat on the edges of the beds or upon the benches placed about the charcoal fires that heated the room. There was no need of beating about the bush trying in some round-about way to reach the subject of religion. Every one of the patients bore the red cross on his sleeve, and a reference to that symbol, which had been the sign of kindly help when he lay wounded on the battle-field, opened the way for speaking at once of Him who had caused the cross to become the emblem of love and salvation. The long hours were made less wearisome to many a homesick boy by the kind words spoken to him, the new thoughts put in his mind, and the Christian literature that was left for his perusal. Some became Christians while in the hospital, and it was doubtless true of others that the impressions there received made them more open to Christian influences after they returned to their homes.

Of many incidents connected with the hospitals, one may serve as a specimen. A bright young fellow who had lost both eyes wrote as follows to the person that had brought him cheer and comfort:

"I married a beautiful young woman just a month before being ordered to the front, and life looked very bright to me. It was a star of hope; but when I fell crushed by a shell, how I longed for death. Must I go back with a face so disfigured that my wife would look on me with horror, and I could never see her face again nor any of those whom I loved? The torture of mind was worse than the excruciating agony I endured from the physical pain.

"When it seemed I must live, I in my mind planned to take my own life. Why not? It was honourable not to be a burden to my beloved ones, and I could never see the little son that was born in February; but when your missionaries came to the hospital and sang even the first hymn, I began to see with my soul; and when you prayed I began to pray, and light came in little by little. You gave me a Bible, but I was dependent on some one else to read to me. But even in this I saw a way to reach others, and the thought of suicide left me.

"Then a day came when you brought me a Bible with raised characters that I could feel. It was the Gospel of John, and in a week I had learned the characters, read six chapters, and could find my place. My comrades who pitied me so much would come to hear me read, and it seemed to them almost a miracle. Then you brought me the blind man's tablet, so that now I can write. . . . Yes, I have now light in the darkness."

At the close of the war, opportunities came for work among the returning soldiers. In Manchuria, the Young Men's Christian Association had its workers so stationed along the railroad leading to the port of embarkation that there was hardly a regiment that did not come under their influence, and most of the soldiers not only shared in the acts of kindness, but also listened to the preaching of the Gospel.

"Every train-load of troops by night or by day was welcomed at least once on the journey and cheered with familiar music and a short Christian talk, while at the termini, thanks to the help and co-operation of the military officials, great halls fully equipped were provided for the amusement and instruction of the returning soldiers. How effective this work was is shown by the testimony of the head of the military police at Dairen, who said that before the establishment of the temperance canteen and the Y. M. C. A. at that place it was no uncommon thing for a hundred and fifty men and officers to slip by the pickets to resort to the disreputable places of amusement in the city, but that after the establishment of these respectable places of amusement there were never more than ten men in a day who sought the baser places in the city. The extent to which the buildings were used is shown by the statement of a Christian cavalryman, who had known the Association at Fengwangcheng, that on his return he tried repeatedly to get inside, but that always at night the place was like a black mountain of humanity and that it was utterly impossible to get inside."

In Japan itself the work for the returning troops was much like that which had been done for them on their way to the war. In some places also, Christian societies tried to shield them from the evils attending their reception by an enthusiastic populace. At Asahigawa in the island of Yezo, where seventeen thousand soldiers that had gone to the war from that district were to he welcomed back, the local temperance society, under the leadership of a missionary lady, petitioned the city authorities that the reception might be given without the use of intoxicating liquor and the employment of dancing-girls. After considerable hesitation the request was granted. The ladies of the society not only helped in serving out tea, but also sang songs of welcome and gave tracts and illustrated cards to both officers and men. The temperance society in the city of Kanazawa was likewise able to induce those in charge of the reception to dispense with *sake,* thus preventing the disgraceful scenes that in many places accompanied the return of the victors.

In the time of war and in the immediately succeeding months, hundreds of thousands while on their way to or from the field, or while in Manchuria, or while in the hospitals, heard something about Christianity. So far as could be judged by outward signs, they were favourably impressed by what they heard. Almost never was any opposition shown; on the contrary, there was much eagerness to get near the speaker and to obtain the books that were being distributed. At the close of the war the survivors were scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land, so that in almost every hamlet there were those who, if anything was said about Christianity, were likely to have some such thought as: "It was a Christian tent in Manchuria where I found a pleasant place to rest and where paper was furnished for the letter that told my friends I was unharmed;" or; "After a long night's ride on a jolting car, when my bandage became disarranged, a foreign lady came to wash my wound and bind it up again, and when I asked, 'Why do you, a foreigner, do such disagreeable work as this?' she said, 'It is for Christ's sake,' and gave me a book to show me the meaning of her words;" or: "When I was in the hospital, some one came and told me that the red cross I wore on my sleeve first got its meaning from the death by crucifixion of One who came to save us from the power of sin." In the ways thus indicated and in many another the seed had been sown and, even though nothing else came from it, one of its fruits was the wide diffusion of some knowledge of Christianity and the lessening of popular prejudice against it as something to be feared by every right-minded person.

Those that go to the battle-field are not the only sufferers; perhaps they are not the chief sufferers from war. The pay of the Japanese soldier was not sufficient to enable him to do much for his friends at home. Especially after the reserves were called out, many families deprived of those who had been the chief wage-earners were left in a destitute condition. In most of the cities the Christians formed societies for giving aid to such families. After a while their ability to do this was greatly increased by contributions of over forty thousand *yen* sent from America and entrusted to the Japanese Evangelical Alliance and the Standing Committee of Co-operating Christian Missions. Two thousand *yen* of this money was transferred to Bishop Nicolai for the benefit of the Russian prisoners, and a like sum to one of the national relief societies as a symbol of the sympathy of foreign friends; but most was sent to local societies or to Christian orphanages. The local societies seemed to use the funds wisely in consultation with government officials, and in several places they expended it in fitting up workrooms where poor women could engage in such occupations as sewing clothes to supply the needs of the army.

When news reached japan of the signing of the treaty of peace at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, September 5, 1905, there was much popular dissatisfaction with its terms. Disappointment was great because Russia had not been compelled to pay an indemnity, and because it was allowed to retain part of Saghalien. In several cities the populace took violent methods of expressing its dissatisfaction with a ministry that had consented to what was styled a disgraceful peace. In Tokyo a mob burned electric cars, police boxes, and a few buildings. Many persons that took part in this uprising did so, not so much because of objections to the conditions of peace, as because it gave an opportunity to show their opposition to the Government and to vent their spite against the electric railway company which, by taking away the work of the jinrikisha-pullers and in other ways had incurred the enmity of the lower classes. It became necessary to call out troops to aid the police in quelling the disturbance, and for several weeks the city was under martial law. A few lives were lost in connection with these riots. Among the buildings destroyed were one Roman Catholic church and two belonging to Protestants, while some others were injured. At first it was thought that these acts were inspired by hatred of Christianity; but it soon became evident that, though such a feeling may have been present with some of the rioters, it was not the chief cause for the attacks upon the churches. To assign reasons for the acts of an unreasoning mob is a task involving a paradox, and it is doubtful how much weight should be given to those that have been suggested in this case. It is said by some that the remarks of a Christian preacher in favour of peace excited the mob against the religion of which he was a representative; very likely the thought of Christianity as a foreign religion led to a feeling of enmity on the part of those that thought Western nations had used their influence in favour of a cessation of hostilities; and some persons who would have hesitated about injuring a dwelling-house may have been led by the spirit of mischief to make the churches the objects of their attack, especially since their glass windows made tempting targets for missiles. When the city was put under martial law, the authorities, who very much feared that these events would be considered in Western lands to be signs of an anti-Christian sentiment, took particular care to see that the churches and preaching-places were duly protected.

The better class of citizens felt that the riot with its attack on Christian edifices had brought disgrace upon the city. What was called the Congress of Religionists, made up of Shintoists, Buddhists, and Christians, resolved to make good the losses suffered by the Christians. For this purpose they raised from religious circles, chiefly Buddhist, about five thousand *yen,* and then by appeals to statesmen, bankers, merchants, and others secured enough to bring up the sum to over thirteen thousand *yen,* which in December, 1906, was given over to the Christian churches for the reimbursement of their losses. Though patriotic motives were probably the ones that had the most influence with the contributors to this fund, the act must be taken as a sign of sympathy and of friendliness towards followers of an alien faith.

The gift made by the Emperor and Empress to the Young Men's Christian Association was not the only proof of a friendly feeling on the part of Their Majesties towards the religion of which that organisation was one of the exponents. The previous year the Emperor and the Crown Prince had contributed to the funds of the Okayama Orphanage; and now at about the same time with the gift to the Association an annuity of one thousand *yen* a year for ten years was promised to the Orphanage; one thousand *yen* were also given to Mr. Hara's Home for Discharged Prisoners; and a little later a like sum was bestowed on Mr. Tomeoka's Home School for Wayward Children. Some foreign opponents of Christianity had tried to argue that the gift to the Association had no religious significance; but this selection of four prominent Christian institutions as recipients of the Imperial bounties made it plain that their work was appreciated and that the religious faith of their founders was not regarded with disfavour. Another recognition of Christian philanthropy was the bestowal \(January, 1906\) of the Decoration of the Blue Ribbon upon Miss Riddell for her efforts in behalf of lepers.

A decoration had previously been bestowed upon Miss McLean who, after spending some years as a missionary in Japan, returned to England, where she took great interest in the Japanese sailors that went to that country. In this way she often met the officers and men of the Japanese navy who were sent to take charge of war vessels constructed in England, or to participate in such festivities as Queen Victoria's Jubilee or the Coronation of Edward VII. After a while a society "for Church-work among Japanese seamen in British ports" was formed. It secured a Japanese for a chaplain, and sustained a "Mission Club," where sailors could find not only lodgings in helpful surroundings, but also sympathy, advice, and recreation. Many men connected with the navy were led to a Christian faith through the influence of this Club.

Somewhat similar work in Japan itself was carried on in the "Army and Navy Mission Club" at Yokosuka, an important naval station near Yokohama. The funds for establishing this were contributed chiefly by foreign friends in japan and America, but afterwards much of its support came from those who were receiving its benefits. An American lady and a Japanese gentleman superintended its operations. "The core of the Club's work has been teaching the Bible and Christian doctrine to the men introduced by members, and bringing to bear all the influences of personal friendship and good cheer, prayer and persuasion, to lead them into the Christian life."When men were removed to other stations the Club kept in touch with them by means of correspondence, courses of Bible study, and monthly reports. Branches were established in other naval stations.

Such efforts as the above help to account for the strong foothold that Christianity obtained in the Japanese navy. Mention has previously been made of Rear Admiral Serata, who died shortly before the Russo-Japanese War. The first victory in that conflict was won by another Christian, Rear Admiral Uryu. Two of Admiral Togo's personal staff were Christians, as were many other officers and men that had an honourable part in the naval manœuvres and battles.

Even such an institution as the Army and Navy Mission Club could not wholly escape the suspicion with which many persons still regarded Christianity. At the beginning of the war there was considerable excitement about Russian spies. Foreign travellers were regarded with suspicion, especially if they were seen examining maps or taking notes. Evangelists, colporteurs, and even ordinary Christians were sometimes accused of being in the pay of Russia. A conflagration that destroyed two hundred buildings at Yokosuka originated in the house of a person connected with the Mission Club, and, notwithstanding that all his family, consisting of six members, perished in the flames, the rumour quickly spread that he was a Russian spy, and that he had burned the house in order to destroy evidences of his guilt. One day crowds gathered on the parade-ground to witness his court-martial and execution, which it had been reported were to take place there.

A few of the Christians did not look upon the war with the same sentiments as most of their fellow-countrymen. Among them were those who believed that the Gospel of Christ forbade its followers to take up the sword. The writings of Tolstoi had found many readers in Japan, and while most of those that were ready to accept his views on other points broke away from his teaching concerning non-resistance, there were some who followed him in this doctrine also. Others who ventured to speak against the war were the socialists. It is not strange that socialism gained some adherents from among those who had been taught by Christianity the brotherhood of man, and who, in seeking ways of helping others, had been led to consider the social problems which, with the introduction of the modern industrial system, were arising in Japan as they had in Western lands. For several years before the war the socialists, some of whose leaders were connected or had once been connected with Christian churches, had shown considerable activity in publishing pamphlets and newspapers, in lecturing, and in forming societies of workingmen. Their efforts had several times brought them into conflict with the Government, so that their meetings had often been cut short by the police, or their newspapers suspended. They had the courage of their convictions so that when the war was imminent and after it broke out they did not hesitate to denounce it. Public sentiment in Japan was so nearly unanimous in favour of the war that this opposition did not attract so much attention as might have been expected. Probably most persons looked upon the socialists as a set of visionaries from whom any kind of eccentricity might be expected. Moreover, there was among students and workingmen—the classes most likely to take active measures against those incurring their dislike-considerable sympathy with the socialists in their denunciation of social abuses and desire for reform; hence, there was less bitter feeling against them on account of their views respecting war.

In the course of this history we have already seen how strong was the desire of the Japanese Christians for independence. They disliked to be in any way under the direction of the missions. In some churches, owing to the system of government, the missionaries had more or less ecclesiastical authority, and in denominations where this was disclaimed, it was thought that their power to give or withhold mission funds gave them actual control over the churches that were aided by them. Pastors and evangelists that received from missions a part of their salaries felt that non-believers regarded them as hirelings; and those of their associates who ministered to self-supporting churches were inclined to nourish that feeling and to declare that the former were not free to adopt desirable methods of work, or to teach the doctrines they really believed when these were not such as the foreigners favoured.

While the missionaries regretted some of the ways in which the spirit of independence manifested itself, most of them were glad for its existence, and rejoiced in the desire of the Japanese to develop churches that should be self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. It cannot be denied, however, that some missionaries were very slow to relinquish any powers that they possessed, while there were a very few who said that they did not care to have the churches with which they were connected become self-supporting. This last class of missionaries should not be charged with being governed by selfish motives. They believed it would be much safer for foreigners to keep control in their own hands until the churches and the ministry had been so well grounded in the faith and accustomed to correct ecclesiastical methods that, when at last set free, they would not depart from the way in which they had been trained to walk. So long as preachers were largely dependent on foreign funds for their salaries they would be careful to preach and labour as the missionary desired instead of running off into all sorts of vagaries in doctrine and method, as was likely to be the case with those whose knowledge of Christianity was not very profound and who had few personal incentives to caution in laying the old aside and adopting what was new.

As might be expected, the great progress made by the nation, and its victory over Russia intensified the desire of the Christians to show that they were able to manage their own ecclesiastical affairs and to take the lead in the conflict against the forces of unbelief and sin. Many members of the Seikokwai \(Episcopal Church\) were not happy in the thought that their bishops were chosen by the ecclesiastical authorities in England and America, and a new impetus was now given to efforts for raising a fund to endow a Japanese episcopate, it being understood that one of their own clergy would be appointed whenever a fund sufficient to ensure his support should be secured.

In 1905 committees were chosen by the Kumi-ai Churches \(Congregational\) and the Mission of the American Board to consult concerning their mutual relations. The joint meetings of these committees were marked by the most pleasant feeling and frank interchange of coinions. The desire of all was to find a plan by which the Kumi-ai body as a whole should be self-supporting. It was made up of the following elements:—1. Self-supporting churches. 2. Churches receiving aid from the Japanese Missionary Society. 3. Churches receiving aid from the Mission. 4. Small companies of believers aided by the Mission and not yet fully organised as churches, though converts were baptised in connection with them, and transfers of members took place between them and the organised churches. The plan proposed by the missionaries and gladly adopted by the Japanese transferred to the Japanese Missionary Society the churches of the third class. To make this possible, the Mission, as a parting gift to the churches that it had been aiding, promised to pay to the Japanese Missionary Society the sum of 8,700 *yen* in three annual instalments of decreasing amount. The Missionary Society on its part promised that within the next three years it would, in addition to its regular budget, raise at least 6,000 *yen* for the aid of these churches, and would thereafter include in the budget whatever might be needed for such of them as had not then attained to self-support. In accordance with this plan, thirty churches \(including a few companies of believers belonging to the fourth of the classes mentioned above\) that had been aided in 1905 to the extent of a little over 5,000 *yen* were transferred. By this arrangement, which came into force in January, 1906, the Kumi-ai body consisted of ninety-one churches,\* and was henceforth wholly independent of mission funds, except as it had among its assets what was due of the "parting gift" to churches hitherto helped by the Mission. Those incompletely organised companies of Christians that still received foreign aid were not considered integral parts of the Kumi-ai body, though their delegates were to be received as corresponding members at the meetings of the general and local associations of the churches.

Unfortunately the agitation for independence in the Church of Christ in Japan \(Presbyterian\) was accompanied by some lack of harmony between that Church and the missions with which it was associated. In addition to the spirit of self-assertion, then so general among the Japanese, various events had made some of the prominent members of this Church dissatisfied with the present arrangement. Among these may be mentioned the objections that one of the missions co-operating in the support of the Meiji Gakuin Theological School made to the use of a certain text-book that it regarded as out of harmony with the Scriptures. The book was dropped\* and thereupon the teacher who had used it, and who was the most influential minister in the Church, resigned. He and another person concerning whom there had likewise been a difference of opinion united in establishing a rival theological school.

At the Synod held in 1904, an attempt was made to pass a resolution looking towards the dissolution of such local churches as should not in a little over two years be financially independent. One of the reasons urged in favour of this action was that the congregations receiving help through the missions were too much under the influence and control of the latter, and that so long as this condition lasted the Church of Christ in Japan could not be truly independent. The resolution failed of acceptance by two votes, but at the next year's Synod action was unanimously taken to the following effect:

1. Presbyteries shall not hereafter organise as churches bodies of believers unable to be financially independent.

2. A body of believers not financially independent shall be called *dendo kyokwai* \(mission-church\).

3. Each presbytery shall enquire into the condition of all the churches within its bounds; and shall endeavour by September, 1907, to bring to financial independence such as are now dependent. Those churches which at that time are unable to be financially independent, it shall take steps to constitute *dendo kyokwai.*

The canons were amended so that a *dendo kyokwai* was to be under the direct care of the presbytery to which it belonged and to have its affairs managed by a committee appointed by that presbytery.

As a large proportion of the bodies to be designated as *dendo kyokwai* had been more or less fully under the personal care of missionaries, the question of how much of this supervision was to be retained became an important one. The missionaries desired co-operation with the Japanese, but there was much doubt about the basis on which this could be secured. It has already been recorded that in 1897 the Synod had declared its dissatisfaction with the methods then in use, and had given its definition of what co-operation ought to be. In 1905 this subject, after having Iain dormant for some time, came once more before the Council of Co-operating Missions, which after a long discussion prepared a paper in which it said that the Council approved of the following plan:

1. The missionaries should be free to engage in work in unevangelised places, it being understood that, wherever practicable, consultation should be had with the local workers and Christians.

2. In the case of organised groups of believers, until they supplied half of their total expenses, their affairs should be administered by themselves and the representatives of the supporting missions, subject to the ecclesiastical oversight of the presbytery.

3. When such a group of believers supplied half of its expenses, its affairs should be administered by the local congregation and the presbytery, any aid from, the mission being given directly to the local organisation.

This action of the Council was not pleasing to the Synod because it included a rejection of what had been proposed, and also because the second part of the new plan gave the missions so much power over the work supported by them. Accordingly, at its next meeting the Synod adopted a resolution declaring that:

"The Synod in the year 1897 clearly recognised the fact that no co-operation in the proper sense of the word existed between the missions and the Church of Christ in Japan, Since that time, no change has taken place, nor is there any prospect of such a change."

A committee was also appointed to prepare a historical account of the matter to be sent to the churches, the missions, and the foreign missionary boards. This committee in sending the account to the boards prefaced it with a letter setting forth the position of the Synod as follows:

"It is now more than thirty years since the Church was first founded, and already it has a history that may rightly be described as eventful. It extends from one end of Japan to the other, and carries on its work through a synod, presbyteries, and congregations. It has a Board of Missions actively engaged in the work of evangelisation and the establishment of churches. Therefore it seems to be reasonable to claim that it has a right to a voice in all work carried on within its organisation or closely connected with it. That is the principle for which the Synod stands and for which it believes that churches in other lands under like circumstances would stand.

"The question of co-operation has agitated the Church and the missions from time to time for nearly fifteen years; and there are those who think the agitation uncalled for since co-operation is already a matter of fact. Whether it is a matter of fact or not depends upon the sense in which the word co-operation is used. The fact that the missions employ evangelists, aid in support of pastors, establish and maintain preaching-places, while at the same time they also in fact practically retain such matters solely within their own control does not in itself constitute cooperation, if by co-operation is meant a co-working which recognises the principle for which the Synod stands. Even though the work done extends to the Church, the system as a system is that of an *imperium in imperio.*

The co-operation which the Church seeks is a co-operation of the missions as missions with the Church as a Church. The missions and the Church, acting as independent organisations, should make clear and definite arrangements with each other under the principle set forth; and the work of the missions as missions carried on within or in close connection with the organisation of the Church should be controlled by such arrangements. Co-operation should find a partial analogy in the alliance between England and Japan; not in the relations between Japan and Korea."

The meeting of the Council of Missions held in July, 1906, gave much time to the consideration of this matter, The discussion centred about a paper that had been prepared by some of the missionaries in consultation with prominent Japanese for presentation to the Synod. It contained the following definition:

"A co-operating mission is one which recognises the right of the Church of Christ in Japan to the general care of all the evangelistic work done by the missions as missions within the Church or in connection with it, and which carries on such work under an arrangement based upon the foregoing principle and concurred in by the Synod acting through the Board of Missions."

Though a motion was lost that pledged the Council to the principle involved in this proposed definition, this fact did not show whether the majority was opposed to the principle itself, some of those who favoured it thinking it unwise to take any action. Three months later, the definition was taken to the Synod and by a majority of one was accepted by that body. One of the chief objections of those that opposed it was based on their dislike of so much centralisation as it was thought to involve by giving authority to the Church's Board of Missions instead of leaving each presbytery to make its own arrangements with the mission or missions working within its territory. This was also a point on which some of the missionaries laid stress, feeling that, while they could make mutually satisfactory arrangements with the presbyteries, it would be more difficult to do so with a central board that was likely to be composed to a great extent of teachers, editors, and pastors of large churches, who had comparatively little knowledge of the conditions of outlying districts and who, with the tendency to emphasise efforts for reaching the so-called "influential classes," might have little sympathy with work done for the common people.

In connection with this discussion much was said and written in disparagement of the missionaries, who were by some accused of letting their desire to control stand in the way of the independence of the Church. The leader in the movement was also editor of a weekly paper whose columns frequently expressed the opinion that many of the missionaries ought to return to America, On the other hand, there were pastors and evangelists whose dislike of the policy advocated led them to some thought of separating from the denomination, since they preferred to continue existing relations with the missionaries rather than come under the control of those Japanese leaders whom they regarded as seeking to lord it over their brethren.

The manner in which the missions should adjust themselves to the position taken by the Synod, became a subject for earnest thought and discussion. At the time when this account is written no uniform method of procedure has been adopted, and it is probable that for some time to come the actual relations between missionaries and the Church will vary in different localities and with different persons. The following plan, presented in July, 1907, by the West Japan Presbyterian Mission and approved by the Board of Missions of the Church of Christ in Japan, shows what the latter was ready to consider a satisfactory arrangement and one in accord with the Synod's position.

"1. Presbytery to elect a Board of Counsellors for Mission evangelistic work; the number, together with a representative appointed by the Home Mission Board, to be the same as the number of missionaries.

"2. This Board of Counsellors together with all the ordained missionaries, members of this Mission working within the bounds of the Presbytery, to constitute a joint committee for the administration of the evangelistic work of the Mission.

"3, This joint committee to decide in regard to all the evangelistic work of the Mission within the bounds of the Presbytery, such matters as the opening and closing of evangelistic fields, the appointment and dismissal of evangelists, the fixing of salaries, the amount of aid to be given to *Dendo Kyokwai,* etc. The committee may also make suggestions to the Mission concerning the supply and distribution of the evangelistic missionary force.

"4. An annual meeting of this joint committee to be held in connection with the meeting of the Presbytery. At this meeting the work of the past year to be reviewed, and estimates for the work of the coming year made out and the work planned for. Thereafter any questions that may arise, to be decided by the local missionary or missionaries in consultation with the Board of Counsellors or a sub-committee of the same.

"5. This plan of co-operation may be modified by the joint action of the Church of Christ in Japan and the Mission, according to the teachings of experience and the growth of the work. Should either party desire to terminate this arrangement, it may be done at any time upon a year's notice."

Previous chapters have recorded the union of the churches that had grown up in connection with the different Presbyterian and Reformed missions, and also that resulting from the coming together of those established by the Episcopalian missions of England and America. A similar combination of those connected with the Methodist Episcopal Church; the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; the Methodist Church of Canada; the Methodist Protestant Church; the United Brethren in Christ; and the Evangelical Association, was for several years under discussion. The Evangelical Association soon withdrew from the negotiations on the ground that its churches were not yet ready to assume the responsibilities that were involved. While the missionaries and the Japanese Christians of the other bodies were almost unanimous in favour of the union, the home authorities did not find it easy to agree upon any plan for its accomplishment. The chief trouble came from questions concerning the degree of authority that should be given to bishops, and the length of a bishop's term of service, as well as those relating to presiding elders and district conferences. While negotiations were still in progress, a movement arose in the United States for the uniting in that country of the Methodist Protestants, the United Brethren, and the Congregationalists; hence the first two of these bodies ceased to take part in the negotiations for a Methodist union in japan. Furthermore, although in America the commissioners of the northern and southern Methodist Episcopal Churches agreed upon a plan under which they could approve of the union of their churches in Japan, it was of such a nature as to be unacceptable to the Canadian Methodists. The Japanese Christians connected with the three bodies were very much opposed to any further narrowing of the combination, and some of them began to say that, as they were the persons most interested, the decision should be made in Japan rather than in America. The missionaries also were disappointed that no satisfactory arrangement had been made. An amended proposition for a basis of union such as was favoured by the missionaries and the Japanese Christians was prepared and a strong appeal for its approval was sent to America, where it proved effective in gaining assent for what was proposed.

In accordance with the decision thus reached, delegates from four annual conferences \(one conference of the Methodist Church of Canada; one of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; and two of the Methodist Episcopal Church\) met in Tokyo, May 22, 1907, for holding the First General Conference of the Methodist Church of Japan. There were also present two commissioners from each of the mother churches in the United States and Canada. At this meeting the final decisions were made concerning the Basis of Union and the Discipline. One of the missionaries writes:

"As to creed the new Church is based upon the historic doctrines of Methodism, eighteen of our articles having' been taken practically without change from the Discipline of the uniting churches. In policy the Church follows again Methodist standards, being Episcopal, with presiding elders nominated, in double the number necessary, to the bishop for his appointment of the proper number for a term of four years each, and with an itinerant ministry without time limit to the pastorate. That is, pastors receive their appointments annually."\*

Rev. Honda Yoitsu, whom the reader will remember as one of the earliest Japanese Christians, was chosen to be the first bishop, and was duly consecrated on Sunday, June 2.

The question of the relations of the missionaries to the new Church was finally settled by the Japanese members of the General Conference, who, after consultation by themselves, were unanimous in adopting the following resolution:

"Resolved. That every missionary regularly appointed by the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, or the Methodist Church, Canada, to work in co-operation with the Methodist Church of Japan, as contemplated in the Basis of Union adopted by the Commissioners of said Churches, shall by virtue of such appointment be entitled to all the rights and privileges of actual membership in the Annual Conference where his service is being rendered, so long as his administration and conduct conform to our Discipline.

"Every such missionary who may in writing elect to serve in this relation shall be subject to the assignment and direction of the missionary authorities of the Church by which he is supported, in consultation with the *Kantoku* \[Bishop\].

"In the event of his non-conformity to our Discipline, the *Kantoku* shall in writing so advise the missionary authorities of the Church to which such missionary is responsible; and the course to be pursued shall then be determined by consultation between the Kanloku and said missionary authorities."

In 1900 the failure of the rice crop in some of the provinces of northeastern Hondo caused great distress among the peasantry. It is said that by December of that year thousands of people were living upon food composed largely of acorns and the leaves of vegetables When snow covered the ground, these supplies were cut off, and numbers of people were in danger of starvation. Christian missionaries were the first to give wide publicity to this condition of affairs and they took a prominent part in efforts for the relief of those in distress. A committee chosen by the foreign community in Sendai, and composed of five Protestant missionaries, one Catholic missionary, and one teacher in a government school, collected and administered about one hundred thousand *yen,* of which about one-half came from the United States. All the relief work was done after full consultation with the local officials, who rendered all possible assistance. Public funds, besides money contributed by Japanese and administered by them, also helped to relieve the wide-spread distress; but the help from foreign sources that was sent through the Sendai committee and still larger sums sent through the Red Cross Society had the additional advantage of being a witness to the sympathy that people of other lands had for Japan, a sympathy that found its counterpart a few months later, when Japan sent three hundred thousand *yen* for the relief of sufferers from the great earthquake in San Francisco.

As one result of the famine, large numbers of children whose parents had died or had become unable to support them were sent to the already existing orphanages, or were cared for in one specially opened for their relief by ladies of the Methodist Mission in Sendai.

The progress in educational matters that had been made by japan began to attract to its higher schools young men from other Asiatic countries—Korea, Siam, India, and especially China. In 1904 the numbers of those coming from the last of these countries suddenly increased to an average of about one hundred new students a month; and in the latter part of 1905 they were coming at the rate of five hundred a month. At the close of 1906 the whole number was said to be over fifteen thousand.\* Nearly all of these were in Tokyo. Removed as they were from accustomed restraints and brought into conditions that subjected them to severe temptations, many of them lived in ways that brought reproach upon the whole class. How the Chinese students should be controlled became a problem for the Minister of their own country, for the Japanese officials, and for such schools as took an interest in the moral welfare of their pupils. They formed a class that was in great need of helpful religious and moral influences.

The National Union of the Young Men's Christian Associations of Japan invited the General Committee of the Young Men's Christian Associations of China, Korea, and Hongkong to make an effort in behalf of these students; and in response to this call Chinese and American secretaries were sent from China to organise and conduct a work for their benefit Evening schools, Bible classes, evangelistic meetings, and social entertainments were soon under way. In January, 1907, a new building was dedicated that furnished permanent headquarters for a work likely to have great influence on the religious history of the land from which these students come and in whose future progress they will have a prominent part.

The willingness of most parents to have their children attend Sunday schools had given churches and missions great opportunities for usefulness; but there had been no general organisation of the schools until 1907 when, in connection with the visit of Mr. F. L. Brown, of the International Sunday School Association, the Sunday School Association of Japan was formed. Under its auspices conventions have been held, "lesson helps" prepared, literature published, and other efforts made for arousing interest in Sunday schools and increasing their efficiency.

Two events in the early part of 1907 did much to direct public attention towards Christianity—the holding of a Conference of the World's Student Christian Federation, and the visit of General William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army.

The Conference, which was held in Tokyo from April 3 to April 7, was the first international gathering ever held in Japan, and so was hailed by its people as another proof that they had gained a recognised place among the nations of the earth. There were one hundred and sixty delegates from abroad, representing twenty-five different countries. English and Japanese were the official languages, all the important addresses and announcements being given in both, this requiring a double interpretation in the few cases where speeches were made in other languages. The prayer-meetings had more of a polyglot nature, each person that took part speaking in his own tongue; while the printing of the hymnal in different languages allowed the same sentiments to be expressed simultaneously in Japanese, English, German, French, Chinese, and Korean. The novelty and suggestiveness of these features impressed the Japanese, as did the fact that the gathering was considered of so much importance that it received messages from the President of the United States, the Kings of England and Norway, and the Crown Prince of Sweden. A letter from Marquis Ito, the Japanese Resident-General in Korea, and his gift of ten thousand *yen* towards the expenses of the Conference were probably expressions in his name of the friendly feeling of the Japanese Government; while leading citizens of Tokyo and members of the nobility tendered receptions to the delegates. The addresses delivered at the public sessions were valuable, but perhaps the indirect influence of the Conference in bringing Christianity so prominently before the people was its greatest service. Many of the delegates afterwards visited different sections of the country to take part in evangelistic services.

One interesting feature of the Conference was the receipt of a friendly message from a meeting of Buddhists being held at the same time in Tokyo, which passed the following resolution:

"The Japan Buddhist Conference wishes to take this opportunity to express its profound respect to the World's Student Christian Federation Conference which is now going on and also to the distinguished guests from abroad.

"The Japan Buddhist Conference shall send a suitable representative to convey this resolution to the World's Student Christian Conference."

The Federation on its part appointed a representative to bear a suitable response to the Buddhists. A letter was also received from a Conference of Shinto priests.

General Booth's name was already well known to the reading public. Placards bearing his portrait and advertising his meetings were posted in all the cities to be visited by him, so that his name was in everybody's mouth, albeit many, it is said, got the idea that he was the commander-in-chief of Great Britain's military forces. The Japanese, who are hero-worshippers, were eager to see a person so famous. His efforts for the social regeneration of the lower classes commended him to many who took little interest in his more strictly religious work. As one Christian paper said: "No other person in private life ever visited this country who was so enthusiastically received by the Japanese people as was General Booth. His public meetings everywhere were crowded to overflowing, and both the high and the lowly, the old and the young, seemed to vie with each other in doing him homage." Official receptions were tendered to him in most of the cities that he visited. In Tokyo he was granted an audience with the Emperor, being allowed to go to the Palace in his usual Salvation Army uniform. "His journeys by rail were almost like a royal progress. At all the chief stations, the mayor and city officials or other representative citizens and the leading Christians came to greet the General. He invariably addressed them as long as the wait at the station would permit. At some of the stations, the students or school children sang welcome songs, and throughout there was remarkable manifestation of affectionate regard." Remaining in Japan a little over a month, he delivered addresses in several cities before audiences that, although an admission fee was charged, crowded the buildings in which meetings were held.

The Students' Conference and the visit of General Booth received due attention from the press. For a while the newspapers abounded with reports and with comments that as a rule were commendatory. One daily paper said that Christianity was the thing about which people were then most desirous to be told, and in order to meet this popular demand it gave considerable space in its columns to passages from the Bible.

It must not be supposed, however, that there were no discordant voices. Some Christian writers thought that the Conference made too much of receptions and other social attentions paid by prominent men. One of these writers, who was noted as a trenchant critic, said:

"Say not the age of miracles is past. Miracles still take place in front of our eyes. Marquis Ito has given ten thousand *yen* for a Christian work\! An impossibility has happened, and it ought to strengthen or weaken the faith of believers as the case may be. Has Marquis Ito undergone that fearful mental and spiritual struggle which is known under the name of Christian conversion? Or have Japanese Christians gone down to his spiritual level to accept his gift? Or did the two meet in midair, one coming up half-way and the other coming down almost half-way?. . . Truly Christianity is moving at high speed in Japan, but whether upward or downward only the future historian can tell."\*

A writer in the *Taiyo,* the most popular of the Japanese monthly magazines, had an article in which, after referring to the Conference, the Salvation Army, and the coming of a new bishop to the Greek Church, he said:

"From all this we can see how earnest the believers are in the spread of Christianity, and how strongly they desire to make Japan a Christian nation in the near future. Their efforts have been heartily welcomed by the people and it is not unnatural that they think that no such opportunity for evangelisation will again present itself. Supposing that these movements should be successful, our Empire will be changed into a Christian country, our unique history extending over a period of twenty-five hundred years will be trampled on, and the spirit of Japan will be destroyed. Not only is the Christian spirit not sufficient to lead the new generation, but it will make the people weak and hypocritical, and will destroy their character. . . . Pay no attention to the hypocritical words of Christians and listen not to their hymns. Long live the non-Christian spirit\! Long live the spirit of the world, of the flesh, of self-confidence, of determination, and of patriotism\!"†

In July, 1907, Baron Kato Hiroyuki, a Privy Councillor and formerly the President of the Tokyo Imperial University, delivered before the Imperial Academy a lecture entitled "Christianity and the State," which attracted much attention. Baron Kato began by declaring his opposition not only to Christianity, but to all religion, because all supernatural ism fosters superstition, and superstition is an obstacle to intellectual progress. He went on to argue that Christianity and Buddhism are the more dangerous to the state because of their cosmopolitan character. Their teaching of universal brotherhood leads to a decay of the nationalistic spirit, and hence they are more objectionable than such religions as Judaism and Brahminism, which confine their attention to the people among whom they have arisen. A religion that claims to be universal places before the citizen the necessity of serving two masters—the State and the deities that he worships. In case their commands differ, there is danger that he will follow the latter. Christianity is specially to be feared because it cannot take on Japanese forms as Buddhism has done. It demands that all shall recognise and serve the one God whom it proclaims. It places that God above the national rulers; but Japanese should never acknowledge that any being is higher than the Emperor. The Salvation Army has displayed banners with the inscription "Japan for Christ," while the Okayama Orphanage has issued a printed invitation to the celebration of its twentieth anniversary beginning with the words, "Through the blessing of the Heavenly Father and the favour of Their Imperial Majesties," thus relegating Their Imperial Majesties to a secondary place, an act of the greatest disrespect such as must be intolerable to a patriot. Christian schools do, indeed, read the Imperial Rescript on Education, but this is only because of the pressure from public opinion. The Rescript and Christianity are absolutely irreconcilable. Many doctrines of the Christians, such as the belief in a personal God, are unscientific, and no educated Japanese should look with unconcern upon the spread of a religion whose acceptance would, from an intellectual point of view, be a step backward, and from that of a patriot, would portend danger to the State.

The lecture as printed in a pamphlet led to much discussion, especially in Christian journals, most of whose writers, however, were inclined to ridicule the thought of bringing up arguments which, though current twenty years before, had long been outgrown. Baron Kato, they said, had fallen hopelessly behind the times; and however pardonable this might be in a man over seventy years old, it would be inexcusable in younger men were they to follow his lead. More direct arguments were used in reply to his assertions. Among other things he was accused of inconsistency, for he had once been ardent in proclaiming the equality of all men, and as an earnest advocate of the doctrines of evolution had written many things quite irreconcilable with what he was now saying about the Imperial Family. In a later lecture Baron Kato said in rebuttal of this charge that, in all of his teachings of the Spencerian philosophy, he had considered the Imperial Family as altogether outside and above all evolutionary processes. Though Baron Kato's belated arguments would probably have had little effect if coming from another source, his reputation as a scholar, and the high positions he had held, gave them a currency and influence beyond their deserts.

A form of work that had been gradually developed became prominent about 1907 under the name "*shuchu dendo,"* a term that has been translated as "concentrated evangelism." As usually conducted, some promising field where there was already a church was chosen several months in advance in order that the pastor, sometimes aided by one or two persons from outside, might prepare the Christians for the movement and also get as many new persons as possible interested in the study of the Bible. In some places this study was conducted on a plan that had originated in Okayama of having "one worker teach one Gospel to one person;" that is, those Christians that volunteered for service received from the leader instructions once a week in whichever of the four Gospels was chosen, and then each one went to the person who, having signified willingness to be taught, had been assigned to his care. When the time came for *shuchu dendo,* several pastors and laymen would spend a week or two in the city holding meetings and also visiting in their homes those that were already interested in Christianity or that were thought to be most accessible. As a result of these efforts many new persons were added to the number of enquirers, but the large additions to the churches came mostly from those who had before, in Sunday schools or elsewhere, learned about Christianity, and were now by this movement brought to the needed decision that made them willing to be reckoned among the disciples of Christ.

### PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE 

HALF a century has elapsed since Japan was re-opened to missionary effort. The preceding chapters have narrated the more prominent events connected with the development of Japanese Christianity in those five wonderful decades. In addition to what has been related, there have been many ways in which Christianity has helped Japan to become what it is at the present day. Indeed, there is good reason for saying that, directly and indirectly, Christianity has been the chief force in effecting the changes that have taken place, so that a pamphlet written by Dr. W. E. Griffis is justified in bearing the title: "Christ the Creator of the New Japan."\* In that pamphlet Dr. Griffis says:

"I could never imagine Bushido of itself alone, or Japanese Buddhism, or Shinto, or the Government, originating a Red Cross, a Peace Conference, a system of hospitals, a Woman's University, the emancipation and elevation to citizenship of pariahs and outcasts \(*eta* and *hinin\)*, freedom of the press, the granting of full toleration of religion, or securing of real representative political institutions. In scarcely one of those features in the New Japan most admirable to Christians or to the best men of the Occident, do I recognise the legitimate offspring of Bushido or forces inherent in Japan. These have been propagated, not developed from within. No, it is to the Spirit of Jesus that we are to accredit most of what is morally superb in the New Japan."

Dr. Griffis shows how some of those who led in the changes that have taken place had new thoughts and purposes inspired in their souls by reading Christian books or coming in contact with Christian teachers, and he says with an emphasis that he expresses by the use of capital letters:

"BEHIND ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE RADICAL REFORMS THAT HAVE MADE A NEW JAPAN STANDS A MAN—TOO OFTEN A MARTYR—WHO WAS DIRECTLY MOVED BY THE SPIRIT OF JESUS, OR WHO IS OR WAS A PUPIL OF THE MISSIONARIES."

The early missionaries, and to a less extent those of a later day, have had great opportunities for exerting influences whose results are not given in tables of statistics. Simply as those that by teaching European languages introduced young men and women to Western literature, they opened the way by which the nation received ideas that have revolutionised its life. To them also came persons who had enquiries to make concerning agriculture, trade, manufactures, and other departments of human activity. Orders for machines were sent through them, merchants asked them to write business letters to firms in foreign lands. The schools that they founded and the societies in whose organisation they had a part stirred up the Buddhists to similar enterprises. Dr. Verbeck organised the school that developed into the first Imperial University. He was for a long time the only foreign counsellor of the Government', and it meant not a little that the advice given in that formative period of the new nation came from one who was a conscientious and broad-minded Christian.

Nearly all the philanthropic efforts for the various classes of people needing such help—orphans, lepers, the blind, the imbecile, wayward children, discharged prisoners, etc.—were begun by missionaries or by Japanese Christians; and in some cases their example has stirred up the Government or those of other religions to care for the unfortunate.\* It will be remembered that a missionary suggested to the Government methods that it afterwards adopted for prison reform, and that another was the chief instrument in bringing about such a change in laws as has weakened the hold of licensed vice upon its victims. In general it may be said that all movements for moral reform look to the Christians as their natural leaders. Not least in the helpful influences coming to the nation have been those due to the examples of noble, educated, Christian womanhood. The homes of the Protestant missionaries and of other persons that in a foreign land have remained true to the ideals of those from which they came, and also the homes, gradually growing more numerous, that have been established by Japanese believers, have made the very name "Christian home" to be widely known as that of the social institution most needed for the moral purification of the land. The influence that Christianity has had on public morals, social customs, the care of the sick, laws, journalism, general literature, music, and even on the very language of the people has been great and beneficial. Christianity is a living force entering into the spiritual nature of men, and what touches the spirit must sooner or later affect all outward acts.

History's proper domain is the past, but no sooner do we turn from her to look upon what now exists than she tears it from our grasp and claims it for her own. While words are being penned and ere they issue from the press, what they describe in the present tense have become things of the past. Nor will history permit us to say that she has no concern with the future, for she knows the time will come when that also will be hers. Moreover, the future is the fruitage of what was sown in the past, and as the farmer when he planted his fields had thoughts of what he will hereafter reap, so history sometimes looks forward and from the experiences of the past ventures to prophesy what the future record will contain.

The time at which this history is being written sees Christianity a recognised force in Japan, The statistics to be given in an appendix will show what can be told by figures; yet every one who has had occasion to examine such tables carefully knows how imperfect a guide they are to actual conditions. In one way they may give too favourable an impression, for lists of church-members often include those that are Christians only in name, and it may be true that some of the churches themselves have so little real life that it would be better to have them struck from the denominational rolls. On the other hand, such statistics fall far short of showing the position to which Christianity has attained. There are outside of the churches, many persons who in their hearts believe the essential doctrines of Christianity and are trying to regulate their lives thereby. Moreover, as has already been said, Christianity is in thousands of ways touching Japanese life, thus accomplishing what cannot be statistically reported and what often fails to be recognised as among its effects.

Quality is certainly of much more importance than quantity in deciding how much has already been accomplished and what are the prospects for the future. A person who examines a work from the outside can be more unprejudiced than one closely associated with it, and so may be able to see more clearly both its excellencies and its defects. Hence, the opinion of a sympathetic but keen observer of Protestant Christianity in Japan may be advantageously quoted at this point. Rev. George S. Eddy, well known as a worker in India for the Young Men's Christian Association, wrote as follows, after a visit to Japan:

"Our impressions of the characteristics of Japanese Christianity, including its virtues and its faults, include:

"\(1\) *Strong independence* with a readiness of the Christians to stand upon their own feet, to bear responsibility, to undertake leadership, and to be unwilling to accept foreign aid a moment longer than is necessary, though receiving everything that can be learned from foreign countries.

"\(2\) *Self-support* and the willingness to pay the price of independence. In this respect India has much to learn from Japan.

"\(3\) *Strength of character* and the ability of believers to think and act for themselves.

"\(4\) *A too liberal theology* with a tendency to take up with every new doctrine, a fondness for rationalistic thought, and a lack of stability in theological thinking, and consequently a lack of deep spirituality.

"\(5\) *Conservatism* in method and a lack of a sufficient sense of evangelistic responsibility. In fact, Japanese have been so taken up with the problem of self-government and self-support that they do not seem, as yet, to have given the prominence they should to the thought of the evangelisation of Japan. In this respect, however, they will soon advance rapidly.

"\(6\) *The high social position,* education, and, as compared with India, the wealth of the Christian community, and its failure to extend sufficiently its operation to the masses and the lower classes.

"\(7\) *Unity,* with an emphasis on practical issues, and an unwillingness to perpetuate the divisions and discussions of the historic Christianity of the West. The Japanese are insisting upon and largely effecting a union of various groups of churches, and are looking toward ultimate union in Japan."\*

What, then, of the future? That form of the Japanese verb to which Europeans have given the name "Future tense" expresses in reality nothing more than probability, and however sure a person may be of the ultimate victory of Christianity, he may well hesitate about stating too positively when and how this is to be brought about. There have, indeed, been some writers who declared that Japan will never become a Christian nation; but at the present day he who makes such an assertion must be a bold prophet and one who has given little study to the trend of events. It may be that the outward form of Christianity in Japan will never be like what is to be seen in England, America, France, or Russia; but what the past fifty years have seen accomplished ought to make even a person who does not recognise God's hand in history acknowledge a strong probability that ere many more decades pass away there will be a Christian Japan. What peculiarities of church government, philosophical dogma, and practical activities will prevail cannot be foretold except as some persons may be sufficiently wise to predict certain features from the past history and present characteristics of the churches. These churches must meet and solve problems such as have come to those of other lands, and also some peculiar to themselves. Difficulties and dangers lie before them. It may be that at times the Kingdom of God will seem to be making no progress and even to be losing ground; but those who have faith in God cannot doubt its final establishment in Japan, and they rejoice in the thought of how much this will mean for the regeneration of Asia, and for the hastening of the time when the whole world shall know and serve the living God.

\* The Japan Year Book for 1907, \(p. 260\), published in English but written by Japanese, says: "It is a significant fact that by far the greater part of private charity work of any large scope is conducted by Christians, both natives and aliens, and that the part played by Buddhists in this direction is shamefully out of proportion. As to Shintoists, they are privileged, in popular estimate, to keep aloof from matters of this kind." In February, 1909, after a thorough examination of all charities in the country, gifts were made by the Japanese Government to seventy-nine philanthropic institutions. A large number of these were under Protestant or Roman Catholic auspices.

Churches formed in connection with some of the other missions combine in such a way that each group practically forms a united church.

B

statistics

The latest available statistics of the missions and churches are those for 1907 as given in the Sixth Annual Issue of the Christian Movement in Japan \(Tokyo, 1908\). The following table is based upon one found in that hook. Only the most important items are given here, as the reports of some missions upon the other matters are so incomplete as to render the statistics unsatisfactory. The absence of figures does not necessarily mean that the mission in question has nothing under the heading; but in some cases shows only a failure to report. The statistics for the Roman Catholics differ somewhat from those given in the volume on Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox Missions the latter being those for 1908.

Besides what is reported in the table, there are two independent churches; one having about 300 members and the other 160.

The numbers of missionaries given in connection with the Japan Methodist Church, the Nihon Kirisuto Kyokwai, and the Nihon Seikokwai are those of persons belonging to the missions that co-operate with those churches.



a. Admitted to Christian fellowship on confession of faith. There seems to be some mistake in the figures given for full membership.

b. Teachers in government schools, secured under Y. M. C. A. auspices.

c. Japanese secretaries.

d. The total baptisms of adults and infants were 838.
