Christianity was legalized under threat of Western gunboats, not because Meiji leaders had a positive view of it. The opposite was true & the top leadership held a conference on how the new era needed new methods to shield Japan from dead jew worship.

In early April 1869, the government had set up within the Dajōkan a bureau for propaganda research, the Kyōdōkyoku. A contemporary diarist reveals that a petition from Ono Jusshin, a Chōshu Confucianist, was behind its creation.34 Ono had been in charge of the Urakami Christians in Chōshū since their deportation there in July 1868. 

The gist of his petition was that the Christian ban could not endure forever in the new international era; that it was imperative that preparations for the lifting of that ban be started; that the key was to revive what he called 'Japanese teachings'. These, which he omitted to define, would protect Japan and prevent people from 'longing for foreign religion'.35

In early June, after Iwakura and Ōkubo arrived in Tokyo for the Tokyo Conference, new appointments were made to the bureau and two new 'commissioner' posts were created: 'saisei itchi commissioners' and 'Christian commissioners'. It is of particular interest that Ōkuni Takamasa's disciples, Fukuba and Kamei, and Ono jointly occupied all three posts. This is clear evidence that, in early summer 1869, the countering of Christianity and the development and dissemination of Shinto had come to be seen by the new government as a single whole. 

State- sponsored attempts to persuade people away from Christianity (toward Shinto) would begin to replace more violent persecution. Whatever additional political benefits Shinto propagation might have these do not appear to have been discussed openly in spring 1869 -- such a policy promised at least to deflect increasingly fierce diplomatic challenges.
