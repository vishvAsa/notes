> The Omurake hiden, or "Secret History of the Omura Houser" reports that it was Miguel who advised Yoshiaki in 1605 that Christianity was nothing but a device for the conquest of foreign lands: "From his youth he had been a student of that sect, and he went all the way to Rome, where through his diligence he reached the innermost recesses [of the doctrine]. After he returned home, he told Lord Yoshiaki in secret: "That faith is extremely pernicious. Outwardly, it purports to deal with the afterlife and salvation, but in reality it represents a plot to grab foreign lands."50 The document concludes: "When we explore the inner doctrine, with Seizaemon as our indispensable guide, [we see that] the Christians reject the customs we practice at home and the laws issued by the authorities. They make light of their official duties and work only for the church."51
