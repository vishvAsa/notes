title: Selective assimilation of foreign thought
---

## Central pattern

- Since the beginning, Japan has constantly been a student-culture, rather than (mostly) inward looking smug know-it-all-culture like medieval India and China (in the post Tang era). Yet, they revered their own nation as the land of the kAmi, and were not swayed by anything and everything.
    - The Chinese, for example, considered whatever happened outside China much less important. This led to the defeats of the Qing empire \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/557179119335526400)\] at Japanese hands.
- Adaption of what they approved of in terms of utility or aesthetics.
- Selectively and forcefully reject what they disliked.
    - Eg. Christianity.
    - Charges of Inferiority by the Chinese and Koreans \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/588911788701437952), [T2](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/592463241915203586)\].

## History

- In 600-s, Japan sent many missions to China to acquire culture and sophistication. Shomu emperor was visited by a South Indian brAhmaNa, who inaugurated many temples.
    - Selectivity \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/588909026781614080)\]
- The 200+ years of isolation and strict control allowed space for a distinct and strong Japanese identity to emerge.

### Dutch studies after the purge of Christians.

- The Dutch were periodically required to meet the shogunate officials and provide detailed reports about current events, with a particular focus on the Catholic enemies.
- From mid 1700's though forbidden some j intellectuals began to study dutch texts for medical knowledge and began translating them into japanese, soon dutch studies (called rangaku) acquired a following, and thru this japanese intellectuals had acquired some knowledge of outside events including western expansion. \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/580374332653748224), [T2](http://i.imgur.com/vQZId6N.jpg), [T3](http://i.imgur.com/spaRPCu.jpg), T4\]

- Study of mechanical advances
    - Guns, ships, locks, clocks and engines - they were all studied and adapted by skilled craftsmen. \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/620925233818681344)\]
- "they produced a japanese biography of russia's peter the great in 1808 because they saw him as a model, just as he made rus a gr8 power thru reforms" \[[T1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/592762421414080513), [T2](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/536928164950601730)\]
- The Meiji restoration and modernization was partly inspired by the study of the west.
