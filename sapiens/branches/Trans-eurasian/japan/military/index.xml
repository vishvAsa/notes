      <description>&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gadadhar Singh was then serving in BIA sent to put down the Boxer rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/details&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Victory at Tianjin&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On 14 July at 4:00 a.m., the walled city of Tianjin was attacked. The assault force was made up of the Japanese infantry, the English Marines and Bluejackets, and the American infantry. The city gate was protected by firmly placed blockades. The walls were fifty to sixty feet in height. Climbing them was, therefore, impossible. The only entry point was through this heavily blockaded gate. The gate lay beyond a small bridge that could be reached by crossing an open flat space of about forty yards without any kind of protective or defensive shield. The Chinese were constantly bombarding and firing from atop of the city walls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
