Front cover: Yamaji Masakuni \(1546–83\), who was killed at the battle of Shizugatake by Katō Kiyomasa, shown here in a fight with an invisible opponent. Although the perfect embodiment of the samurai image, he also resembles the guardian *Niō* statues in a gateway to a Buddhist temple, or an actor in a Noh play frozen in motion for an expressive moment. The inclusion of a branch of flowering azalea makes a connection between the ruthlessness and the delicacy of the samurai’s life.

Dedication:

This book is an engagement present for my dear daughter Katy and her fiancé Richard Robinson.
