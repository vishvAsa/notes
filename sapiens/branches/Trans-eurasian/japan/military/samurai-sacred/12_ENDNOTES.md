**THE WAY OF THE GODS**

1 For fascinating accounts of what actually happens during shrine visits, see Nelson, John K., ‘Freedom of Expression: The Very Modern Practice of Visiting a Shinto Shrine’, *Japanese Journal of Religious Studies*, 23 \(1996\) pp.117–153; reprinted in Nelson, John K., *Enduring Identities: The Guise of Shinto in Contemporary Japan*, Honolulu \(2000\) pp.22–52; and Reader, Ian, *Religion in Contemporary Japan*, London \(1991\) especially pp.134–167.

2 This perceived ‘Japanese-ness’ of Shintō may be illustrated in a different and less positive way. When Japan’s colonial role over Korea ended in 1945 the 1,133 Shintō shrines erected in Korea were speedily destroyed by the local population, who had always seen them as a symbol of occupation. See Grayson, James H., ‘Shinto and Japanese Popular Religion: Case Studies of Multi-variant Practice from Kyushu and Okinawa’, *Japan Forum*, 17 \(2005\) p.364.

3 Most of the others are shrines to Inari, the *kami* of rice, and are affiliated to the Fushimi Inari shrine near Kyōto.

6 Kishimoto, Hideo, ‘The Worship of Mt. Miwa’, in *Omiwa Shrine* \(an English-language booklet produced by the Omiwa Jinja\), Sakurai, not dated, p. 7. Mount Sinai, by contrast, which is important to three religions, is open to pilgrims and tourists alike. Nevertheless the ancient monastery of St Catherine, which lies at its foot, was given special protection by the Prophet Muhammad, a gesture that any Japanese would fully understand.

29 It is sometimes stated that the reasons why most imperial *kofun* have never been excavated is that the imperial family are afraid that this will expose their ancestors as Korean invaders rather than as descendants of *kami*. This is challenged in Edwards, Walter, ‘Contested Access: The Imperial Tombs in the Postwar Period’, *Journal of Japanese Studies*, 26 \(2000\) pp.371–392. The ‘horse rider’ theory, whereby the Jing legend is completely reversed, is associated particularly with the Japanese scholar Egami Namio, and was made known to the West largely through Ledyard, Gary, ‘Galloping Along with the Horseriders: Looking for the Founders of Japan’, *The Journal of Japanese Studies*, 2 \(1975\) pp.217–254. For a refutation see Edwards, Walter, ‘Event and Process in the Founding of Japan: The Horserider Theory in Archaeological Perspective’, *Journal of Japanese* Studies, 9 \(1983\) pp.263–295.

10 This is the concept of *kenmon* \(‘powerful lineages’ or ‘ruling elites’\). The idea was introduced by the scholar Kuroda Toshio. According to his approach, between the 11th and 15th centuries power in Japan was shared by a number of elite groups who were the leaders of three power blocs: the *kuge* \(court nobles\), the *buke* \(the samurai warrior aristocracy\) and the *jisha* \(shrines and temples\). Their common cause provided a unifying ideology for the state. The imperial law \(*õbõ*\) and Buddhist teachings \(*buppõ*\) were like the two wheels of a cart. For a very clear exposition of Kuroda’s theory see Dobbins, James C., ‘Editor’s Introduction: Kuroda Toshio and His Scholarship’, *Japanese Journal of Religious Studies*, 23 \(1996\) pp.218–232, especially pp.219–225.

1 The arrival of Europeans in Japan has been exhaustively treated in Lidin, Olof G., *Tanegashima – The Arrival of Europeans in Japan*, Copenhagen \(2002\).

2 Cast-iron Chinese hand guns with short barrels had been known in Japan since 1510. They were used in battle as late as 1548, but were rapidly supplanted by arquebuses of Japanese manufacture. These had been copied from the Portuguese originals introduced in 1543 and were probably first fired in anger against Chinese pirates in 1548.
