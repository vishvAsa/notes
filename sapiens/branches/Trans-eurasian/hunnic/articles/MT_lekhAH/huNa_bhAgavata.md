Where the Alkhan huNa-s paramabhAgavata-s. Below is our tabulation, the only systematic one to our knowledge, of the key symbols left behind by various huNa lords, while vaiShNava symbols dominate in overall number, they are not exclusive. Hence, we may infer that they were typical paurANika H may be with vaiShNava leanings. In support of this after the Alkhan lord toramANa overthrew the gupta viceroy at airikiNa (modern Eran in MP) during his invasion of mAlava, he allowed his successor, now as his feudatory, to complete the viShNu temple.

toramANa's son mihirakula is clearly mentioned as a pAshupata and keeping with this his coins AFAIK only feature a trishUla. However, we have a possible sealing from him which depicts him worshipping viShNu & he has lakShmI on his coins. So he might have had shaiva leanings but was again likely a paurANika H. See all images in this earlier thread for some exemplars of the vaiShNava symbols:

We now follow Tandon's reading that the gada coin was not khi~Ngila but javUkha.
