*There is a khan’s daughter  
Who steps on in a swinging manner  
And has the marks of twenty tigers,  
Who steps on in a graceful manner  
And has the marks of thirty tigers,   
Who steps on in an elegant manner   
And has the marks of forty tigers,  
Who steps on in a delicate manner   
And has the marks of fifty tigers*.
