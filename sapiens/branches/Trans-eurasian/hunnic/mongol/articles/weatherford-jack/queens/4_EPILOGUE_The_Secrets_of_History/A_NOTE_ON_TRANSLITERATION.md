FIFTEENTH-CENTURY MONGOLIAN HISTORY HAS BEEN ONE of the most confusing times for scholars because of the difficulty of establishing a clear timeline. The chronicles using the animal cycle of years are often difficult to correlate with one another or with the modern calendar. The best chronology available has been published in Mongolian in three comprehensive volumes by Professor B. Baljinnyam, and whenever possible I rely upon his dates.

English-speaking scholars use many different ways of transliterating classical and modern Mongolian names and words. The correct title for the founder of Mongolia is Chinggis Khan, pronounced CHIN-gis, but by tradition it is rendered in English as Genghis Khan. Generally, I use the spelling that is easiest for the reader rather than adhering to only one system. For example in the name Qaidu Khan, the *Q* and *Kh* represent the same guttural sound. I use the *Qaidu* spelling solely because the reader can find more additional information on him under that spelling; yet, for his daughter Khutulun, more can be found using the *Kh* spelling. For the same sound I use only an *h* as in the common spelling *Manduhai* \(rather than *Mandukhai* or *Manduqai\)*, because it better approximates the pronunciation of *Man-du-HI*.

Similarly, I use classical and modern spellings, depending on the need, and avoid alternate spelling for the different Turkic and Mongolian dialects of different eras. Thus for simplification, *khan* is used for *khaghan, khan*, and *khagan* or the modern *khaan;* similarly, *beki* is used for *bek, beg, beghi, bägi*, and *begi*. Scholars will recognize the underlying form, but for most readers, using only a single form will be easier.

Modern Mongolian names are usually written with an initial preceding the name. In the twentieth century, the use of clan names was forbidden, and since Mongolians generally have only one name, they added the initial of the father’s, or sometimes the mother’s, name to distinguish them from others with the same name.
