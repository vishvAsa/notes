Rashid al-Din identifies the girls as Oirat, but Juvaini *\(Genghis Khan: The History of the World-Conqueror*, translated by J. Boyle \[Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1997\]\) leaves the name of the tribe blank. The *Secret History* \(Igor de Rachewiltz, trans., *The Secret History of the Mongols* \[Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2004\]\) identifies them as belonging to Uncle Otchigen, but Ogodei would hardly have been seeking to marry the women of his own patrilineage.
