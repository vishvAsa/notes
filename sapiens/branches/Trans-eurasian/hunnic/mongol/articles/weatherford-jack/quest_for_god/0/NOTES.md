**Preface: Genghis Khan, Thomas Jefferson, and God**

1.****Edward Gibbon, *The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*, vol. III, chap. XXXV.

2.Ibid., vol. VI, chap. LXIV. The correct modern spelling of Genghis Khan’s title in Mongolian is Chinggis Khaan, but outside of Mongolia, his name has been spelled in many different ways: *Chingiz* in Arabic and Persian, *Chingischam Imperator* in the first Latin references in Europe, *Cambyuskan* in the earliest English writings of Geoffrey Chaucer. There are several systems of Romanization for the Mongolian language and a variety of spellings are used in this book according to what seems easiest for the reader to pronounce or easiest to use for further research. Similarly, Chinese and Arabic names and words are usually presented according to the spelling of the English-language sources, without forcing all of them into one system. Alternative spellings and forms of Romanization are presented in notes as deemed helpful to the reader.

3.A facsimile reproduction of the manuscript has been published as *The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina dated July 21, 1669 drafted under the supervision of John Locke*, foreword by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, \(Charleston: Charleston Library Society, 2012\).

6.“They put to death the Caliph, and sacked Bagdad, just as they sacked the cities of Russia and Hungary,” wrote President Theodore Roosevelt at the start of the American imperial century. “They destroyed the Turkish tribes which ventured to resist them with the thoroughness which they showed in dealing with any resistance in Europe.... They conquered China and set on the throne a Mongol dynasty. India also their descendants conquered, and there likewise erected a great Mongol empire. Persia in the same way fell into their hands.... They struck down Russians at a blow and trampled the land into blood mire beneath their horses’ feet. They crushed the Magyars in a single battle and drew a broad red furrow straight across Hungary, driving the Hungarian King in panic flight from his realm. They overran Poland and destroyed the banded knighthood of North Germany in Silesia.” Theodore Roosevelt, “Foreword,” in Jeremiah Curtin, *The Mongols* \(Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1908\).

9.“Sweet and venerable” seems to refer to the Manichaean notion that Jesus was sweet, which can be found in one of the Manichaean Psalms. “Taste and Know that the Lord is sweet. Christ is the word of Truth; he that hears it shall live. I tasted a sweet taste, I found nothing sweeter than the word of Truth. Taste and Know that the Lord is sweet.” The Gnostic Society Library: *Manichaean Writings*; http://www.gnosis.org/library/manis.htm.

7.Seers: *μ**άντεις* read omens and predicted the future; shamans, referred to as ’*ερεις* or priests. Names of high-ranking officials such as Ataqam, *Άταχά**μ* meaning Father of Shamans, or Eskam, *Έσχά**μ* who was the father of one of Attila’s favorite wives, further indicates the importance of shamans in Hun culture.

8.Powerful women: They were not old women stirring a pot in a *ger*; they were active in the centers of power and seem to have been younger and more beautiful women. In the early sixth century the Rouran \(Нирун in Mongolian; also known as Juan-Juan\) leader Chounu Khan fell in love with a beautiful female shaman, but his affair so disrupted the plans of his mother that she had him killed in the year 520 and replaced by another of her sons. Denis Sinor, *Studies in Medieval Inner Asia* \(Brookfield, VT: Ashgate Publishing, 1997\), I-294.

9.Attila: *A**ττίλας**, Atala,* *Atalum*, possibly meant Father Ocean.

28.Rashid al-Din clearly states that Genghis Khan executed his uncle. The *Secret History* also states clearly that Genghis Khan condemned him to death, but then adds that before the sentence could be carried out, he relented and spared the uncle. In either case, whether dead or alive, the uncle disappeared from history at that moment, and no further mention of him was made. For the conflicting accounts, see *Secret History*, § 255, and Igor de Rachewiltz’s discussion of the issue in *Secret History*, 652.

33.*Secret History*, § 21. In another Manichaean influence on the *Secret History* and the tale of Alan Goa, a Parthian fable attributed to Mani described a man on his deathbed who called his sons together and told them the tale of the bundle of sticks. Available in German translation: “Der Apostel erzählte dem Turan-Schach ein Gleichnis: Es war ein Mann, und es waren sieben Söhne. Als die Stunde des Todes gekommen war, rief er seine Söhne. Sieben—uranfängliche—und—Treibstock—gebunden. Er sprach: ‘\[Alle\] zugleich zerbrecht\!’ Keiner war dazu \[imst\]ande. Darauf öffnete er \[das Band—\].” In turn this Manichaean story possibly was taken from \(or shared a common source with\) the Greek tales of Aesop. R. Merkelbach, “Eine Fabel Manis,” *Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik*, vol. 75 \(1988\): 93–94.

34.Mongols incorporated many of the stories about Alexander the Great into the history of Genghis Khan. In 1246, at the time of the visit of the first European envoy to the Mongols, Friar Giovanni di Plano Carpini heard stories from the *Romance of Alexander*, but the stories had been adapted to Mongolia and were associated with Mongol khans. He reported that in a battle against India, the leader of the Indian forces had dummy warriors made of brass propelled by a fire inside. When they approached the steppe warriors, the brass dummies shot out fire that burned the horses and routed the invaders. The *Romance of Alexander* reported precisely the same story regarding Alexander’s attempt to invade India. Behind the dramatic, and mostly fictitious, folk tales and myths about Alexander was a sophisticated ideology with a complex view of the relationship between politics and religion. It was at heart a version of Greek philosophy, principally that of Alexander’s teacher Aristotle, but filtered through the lens of Mani’s teachings.

41.One of Mani’s scriptures, known as the *Book of the Two Principles*, remained largely unknown in the West. It may not have been translated into a European language, but it was translated from Syriac into Chinese and Turkic to become the most influential of Mani’s scriptures in the East. The doctrine of two principles became so popular in Asia that the Taoists included it as one of their sacred scriptures for more than a century, from 1016 until the doctrine was banned by Sung authorities as foreign and false. *Book of Two Principles*: ibid., 372–73.

14.Bar Hebraeus, 354. After the shattering of their illusion that the Mongols were the fabled Christian army of Prester John who would liberate the world from the Muslims, European observers decided that the Mongols were Jews. The generally well-informed chronicler Matthew Paris and many other intellectuals of the thirteenth century thought that the Mongols were one of the lost tribes of Israel. Part of the evidence rested on the fact that they wrote in what a Hungarian bishop reported as being the Hebrew script, *literas Judaeorum*. \(Sophia Menache, “Tartars, Jews, Saracens and the Jewish–Mongol ‘Plot’ of 1241,” *History*, vol. 81, 1996: 333.\) The Jews fared well under Mongol rule. According to Bar Hebraeus this was because “with the Mongols” there is “neither believer nor pagan; neither Christian nor Jew; but they regard all men as belonging to one and the same stock.” \(Bar Hebraeus, 490.\) Muslims and Jews both had nomadic roots, unlike the Chinese, whose civilization depended on agriculture. Genghis Khan found people of pastoral heritage much easier to understand. Some chroniclers referred to his law as the Torah, using the same word as for the Jewish law, recognizing that in addition to being a conqueror he was an important lawgiver, an act that they associated with prophets and saints. For Muslims, Muhammad was the last and final prophet, after whom there would be no more, but the Arab chronicler Ibn Wasil wrote in 1260 that the Mongols also considered Genghis Khan a prophet. \(“Ibn Wāil war der Ansicht daβ Dschingis Khan bei den Mongolen den Rang eines Propheten habe. Abstammung war unter den Mongolen wesentliches and sichtbares Zeichen einer von Gott legitimierten Herrschaft.” Stefan Heidemann, *Das Aleppiner Kalifat AD 1261*, Leiden, Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 1994, 165.\) Some Muslim writers referred to his teachings as *The Torah of Genghis Khan,* and the *Torah-i-Chingizi* is a body of law that continued to have philosophical and legal importance in Moghul India for centuries. The belief in a reputed Jewish connection was shared by many European Jews of the time, based on the evidence of the Mongols’ Semitic alphabet \(their script was in fact derived from ancient Syriac\). A letter written by a Jew in Sicily reported that the Mongols carried documents “written in Hebrew characters and... signed up and down with twelve golden seals.” The net result was that “the King of Spain, and the King of Germany, and the King of Hungary, and the King of France are in fear and shaking.” \(Sophia Menache, Ibid., 334.\) According to the Jewish calendar, the year 5000 was approaching \(1240 in the Christian calendar\), and many thought that the Mongols had been sent to defeat the forces of evil in preparation for the arrival of the long-awaited Messiah. Genghis Khan’s leniency toward Jews in his conquest of Khwarizm and the service of Jews in the Mongol army and government further strengthened this belief. The identification of Mongols with Jews grew stronger as the Mongols approached Jerusalem leading up to the Battle of Ayn Jalut in 1260. Jewish poet and scholar Meshullam da Piera was certain that they had come to restore the temple of Solomon. \(Maurice Kriegel, “The Reckonings of Nahmanides and Arnold of Villanova: On the Early Contacts Between Christian Millenarianism and Jewish Messianism,” *Jewish History,* vol. 26, 2012, 25.\)

In addition to myths about the Nizari in Marco Polo, one of the most influential modern works on them was the novel *Alamut*. It was written by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol \(trans. Michael Biggins \[Berkeley, California: North Atlantic Books, 2007\]\) as an allegory against the Fascist ideology of Benito Mussolini in 1930s Italy, and later used as a similar critique against subsequent dictators and totalitarian systems around the world. The novel was made into a dramatic opera by Slovenian composer Matjaž Jarc \(Križnar, Franc, “On ‘Alamut,’ and Opera in Three Acts,” Fontes Artis Musicae 55.2 \[2008\]: 377–88\). Bartol’s novel introduced the phrase, “nothing is absolute reality, all is permitted,” later made more famous by William Burroughs as “nothing is true, everything is permitted,” as a theme in his novel *Naked Lunch* \(New York: Penguin, 2015\).

18.It took Carpini another year to return to Rome. Although Matthew Paris noted in his entry for 1247 that the pope’s envoy had returned, he did not mention Carpini by name. Instead he sniffed at the Khan’s claim of superior power when he reported the pope “received a mandate from the king of the Tartars ordering him to become his subject. This king, in daring and profane words, asserted in his letter that he was immortal.” Paris gives the impression that the Khan was quoting the Bible by claiming “he and his followers were those of whom it was written, ‘the Lord gave the earth to the children of men’” \[Psalms 115:16\]. In the confusion, and not knowing anything of the Mongol’s history, Paris and many others assumed that they were Jewish, one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. *Chronicles of Matthew Paris: Monastic Life in the Thirteenth Century*, ed. and trans. Richard Vaughan \(New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1984\), 94. After such a long and unprecedented trip, Carpini received an appointment as the archbishop of Antivari on the Dalmatian coast of modern Montenegro. He wrote up his observations about the Mongols and his recommendations for how to deal with them diplomatically as well as militarily in his *Historia Mongalorum quos nos Tartaros Appellamus* \(*The History of the Mongols Whom We Call the Tartars*\). The book provided an important ethnographic sketch of the Mongols and a short history, including an account of the life of Genghis Khan and his role in founding the Mongol people. Vatican librarians lost it amid their troves, and like many of the Mongol letters and documents sent to the Vatican, it was not to be seen or read again for several centuries.

43.“The old Mongol tradition,” wrote Russian scholar Nicholay Gumilev, “had been poured out too widely to remain of a piece and the streams formed from this source could not, and did not wish to, flow along one course.” \(*Searches for an Imaginary Kingdom,* by L. N. Gumilev, trans. R.E.F. Smith \[Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1987\], 203\). Nineteenth-century Mongolian writer Injannasi reached the same conclusion. “The decline of our Mongols was the result of too much easy living,” he wrote. Yet, “when one tries to explain this fact, he is accused of being an infidel or heretic before he is heard”\(*Köke Sudur *\[*The Blue Chronicle*\], trans.

Allen Mandelbaum \(New York: Bantam Classics, 1982\), canto I, lines 103–5, 6. Many Renaissance scholars have rejected this supposed Mongol symbolism and insisted instead that the symbols derived from classical Greek and Roman sources. The connections to Genghis Khan via Marco Polo are explained in Cesare Emiliani, “The *Veltro* and the *Cinquecento diece e cinque*,” *Dante Studies*, vol. 111 \(1993\): 149–51. Other background information is available in Leonardo Olschki, *The Myth of Felt* \(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1949\). Gran Cano also bears similarity to the nickname *Cangrande*, given to one of Dante’s patrons, Francesco della Scala.

6.For centuries, Guards kept foreigners away from the shrines, and only a few Mongols could enter. Not until centuries later did the first foreigners, two Belgians, manage to see the shrines and describe them. According to their report, the tents “contained various precious objects, such as a gold saddle, dishes, drinking-cups, a tripod, a kettle, and many other utensils, all in solid silver.” *Missions Catholiques*, No. 315, June 18, 1875, 293, quoted in *The Book of Ser Marco Polo,* trans. Henry Yule, chap. X \(London: John Murray, 1903\), 249. Another visitor described the shrine as “two large white felt tents, placed side by side, similar to the tents of the modern Mongols.” Because of the secrecy surrounding the shrines, many people erroneously assumed that they contained the remains of Genghis Khan. One such report claimed that “a red curtain, when drawn, discloses the large and low silver coffin, which contains the ashes of the Emperor, placed on the ground of the second tent.” He had been buried at Burkhan Khaldun, and although the portable shrines had moved around with the items that had belonged to him, he never again left his beloved mountain.

9.In the Hellenistic kingdoms that arose in Afghanistan after Alexander the Great, Heracles became the protector of the Buddha known as Vajrapani. Heracles was frequently depicted in art and on coins as the perfect embodiment of manhood, and according to Greek mythology, he usually carried a large club with which he had slain a lion as his first heroic act. In the Greco-Buddhist synthesis of art and religion, Heracles and his club represented the Bodhisattva Vajrapani and his thunderbolt, with which he protected the Buddha. His name meant “holder of the thunderbolt,” from the Sanskrit *vajra*, meaning both thunderbolt and diamond.

The king had forced his discontented people to accept the new Grand Lama under the threat of violence and with the aid of a foreign power, the emperor of China, who had allied himself with his royal relative and supported his decision in this manner.

47.“A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, 18 June, 1779”: Well aware that the opinions and belief of men depend not on their own will, but follow involuntarily the evidence proposed to their minds; that Almighty God hath created the mind free, and manifested his supreme will that free it shall remain by making it altogether insusceptible of restraint; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, who being lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do, but to extend it by its influence on reason alone; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through all time: That to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness; and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which, in common with his fellow citizens, he has a natural right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that the opinions of men are not the object of civil government, nor under its jurisdiction; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself; that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.* We the General Assembly of Virginia do enact* that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities. And though we well know that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding Assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right. http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-02-02-0132-0004-0082.

48.John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers and the second president of the United States, remained critical of the excessive praise heaped on Genghis Khan. Because of his diplomatic problems dealing with Napoleon, Adams had a strong dislike for conquerors in general. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, who was the sometimes rival and sometimes ally of Adams, on July 16, 1814, Adams criticized Napoleon as a “military fanatic” comparable to Alexander, Caesar, Muhammad and Genghis Khan. In another letter to Jefferson on March 10, 1823, Adams criticizes Napoleon’s campaigns because conquest is always bad. He wrote that Genghis Khan destroyed “many millions of lives, and thought he had a right to the whole globe, if he could subdue it” \(*The Writings of Thomas Jefferson*, ed. H. A. Washington \[New York: H. W. Derby, 1861\]\).
