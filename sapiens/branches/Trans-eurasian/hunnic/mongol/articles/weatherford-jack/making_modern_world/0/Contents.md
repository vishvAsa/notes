To the Young Mongols:



Never forget the Mongolian scholars  
who were willing to sacrifice their lives to preserve your history.





 

 

 





This noble king was called Genghis Khan,  
Who in his time was of so great renown  
That there was nowhere in no region  
So excellent a lord in all things.
