Transliteration



There are at least a dozen systems for transliterating classical and modern Mongolian names and words into Latin letters, but no single system has been agreed upon. In the belief that scholars can easily understand all the spellings, I opted to use the renderings that are easiest for the English speaker to read, understand, and pronounce, and in so doing I adhere to the following principles.




1. If a common form already exists in English, I use it. Thus, I use the Persian name *Genghis*, simply because that spelling is more recognized than *Chinggis, Jenghiz, Djingis*, or the many other renditions of the name. Similarly, for the old capital I use the widely known Turkic form *Karakorum,* rather than the modern Mongolian name *Kharkhorin* or the more scholarly name *Qaraqorum*.

2. For toponyms, I prefer modern Mongolian names whenever possible—such as *Kherlen* River, rather than *Herlen, Kerulen,* or *Qerelen*. I use the Mongolian version of the modern capital *Ulaanbaatar* rather than the Russian form of *Ulan Bator*.

3. I use *khan* for tribal leader or Mongol king, but I use *Great Khan* for the highest office. To follow modern Mongol usage of *khan* for king and *khaan* for the Great Khan would be too confusing for the English reader.

4. One of the most common consonants in Mongol is the Mongol *kh*—similar to *ch* in German *ich* or Scottish *loch*. It is sometimes written as *q, h,* or an apostrophe.

5. Whenever possible, I avoid umlauts or diacritical marks. In Mongolian, as in the other Altaic languages, the differences between front vowels and back vowels is of critical importance. Anyone who speaks the Mongolian language will know whether the names are pronounced in the front or the back of the mouth, and for most other readers, the marks are probably not relevant.
