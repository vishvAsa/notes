Mongol origin mythology, as described by the Chingizid historian Saghang Sechen:
</details>


Now, on the establishment of the external universe, the main support of everything, from the celestial sphere that generally supports the internal beings: if we discuss the establishment of the very first of these, the external material world, it was established by three sorts of mandala-s. In particular, these three maṇḍala-s were 

- the mandala creating wind, 
- the maṇḍala of billowing water, and  
- the mandala supporting earth. 

The first of these three, the mandala of wind: because of the colliding together and the moving this way and that way of the great winds from the ten directions in the primordial emptiness of the celestial sphere, there was established a mandala of wind, indestructible and having a bluish color termed “delicate” (i.e., the sky).

As for the second, the water maṇḍala: owing to the warmth of that wind, a great cloud called the Aggregate of Jewels accumulated. Then, because a heavy rain fell constantly, the limitless great sea called the Salty Sea came into being and the water mandala was established.

As for the third, the earth mandala: above this water, a molecular dust called Having a Golden Heart became fixed like the skim on milk. Thereupon, this very fine dust became larger, each being successively seven times greater than its precedent: an atom; a particle of iron dust; a particle of water; a particle of dust on the hair of a hare; a particle of dust on the hair of a sheep; a particle of dust on the hair of a cow; a mote floating on a sunbeam; a nit; a louse; a grain of barley. Seven barley grains make one inch; twenty-four inches make one cubit; four cubits make one fathom; five hundred fathoms is the distance that the sound of a trumpet can be heard; eight trumpet blasts make one league. 

In that way the thick great immensity of the earth maṇḍala, called the Very Mighty Golden World, was formed. And in its middle there simultaneously appeared the majestic Mount Sumeru, the King of Mountains, which is surrounded by seven golden mountains and seven seas, as well the four great continents and the eight lesser continents.
