Huns, Uralics, and empires of the steppe
A map by Savelyev et al. for the geographic orientation of the reader of the below article.
The Huns of Europe “The lord of the Huns, King Attila, born of his father Mundzuk, lord of the bravest tribes, who with unprecedented power alone possessed the kingdoms of Scythia and Germania, and having captured their cities terrorized both Roman empires and, that they might save their remnants from plunder, was appeased by their prayers and took an annual tribute. And when he had by good fortune accomplished all this, he fell neither by an enemy’s blow nor by treachery, but safe among his own people, happy, rejoicing, without any pain. Who therefore can think of this as death, seeing that no-one thinks it calls for vengeance?”">

<h2 id="the-huns-of-europe">The Huns of Europe</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The lord of the Huns, King Attila, born of his father Mundzuk, lord of
the bravest tribes, who with unprecedented power alone possessed the
kingdoms of Scythia and Germania, and having captured their cities
terrorized both Roman empires and, that they might save their remnants
from plunder, was appeased by their prayers and took an annual tribute.
And when he had by good fortune accomplished all this, he fell neither
by an enemy’s blow nor by treachery, but safe among his own people,
happy, rejoicing, without any pain. Who therefore can think of this as
death, seeing that no-one thinks it calls for vengeance?”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a prose translation of a poem on the death of Atilla based on
the rendering from the Latin furnished by E.A. Thompson. It is believed
to have been narrated by a German to Priscus of Panium, a Greek who had
lived among the Huns. In turn, it was transmitted in Latin by
Cassiodorus and from him to Jordanes, from whom it has come down to us.
This describes the death of Attila, the lord of the Huns of Europe, who
had died after heavy drinking celebrating his marriage to his latest
wife, a Germanic woman Hildegund (rendered as Ildiko). He seems to have
had a hemorrhage in his respiratory tract leading to bleeding into his
lungs and probably unable to raise himself in the drunken stupor
“drowned” in his own blood.</p>
<p>This marked the climax of the great wave of Hun invasions in the West in
early 453 CE. Who were these Huns who terrorized the Roman and German
worlds, which were steeping into a “dark age” under the terrible West
Asian mental disease, the second Abrahamism, following the death of the
great Julian in 363 CE? Shortly after Julian’s death, the Huns appear to
have invaded from the distant East and beaten the Iranic tribe
(hereinafter, we use Iranic for the people and Iranian specifically for
the Sassanian empire) of the Tanaitae sometime between 370-380 CE.
Priscus tells us: “<em>The Huns killed and plundered the Tanaitae and
joined the survivors to themselves in a treaty of alliance. Then in
company with them, they made more boldly a sudden inroad into the
extensive and rich cantons of Ermenrichus (Hermannaric, the Gothic
German)</em>” — translation by Otto Maenchen-Helfen. Who were these
Tanaitae? From their name, we can say that they were people living on
the Don (the Dānu of the Indo-Iranians). The heathen Roman general
Ammianus Marcellinus tells us: “<em>The Huns overran the territories of
those Alani [bordering on the Greuthungi (=the Eastern Gothic Germans,
or Ostrogoths)] to whom usage has given the surname Tanaitae (the
people of Dānu).</em>” Thus, these can be identified with the steppe
Iranics, who still retained the old ethnonym (airya&gt;Alan).</p>
<p>The German ruler Hermannaric was said to be like a second Alexander of
Macedon, who had subjugated various Iranic, Uralic (i.e., Mari), Baltic
and Slavic tribes, in addition to unifying various German groups under
him. Hermannaric had a woman named Sunilda, likely from a (married to)
subjugated Iranic tribe, torn to shreds and her brothers attacked the
Germans to avenge this. While they failed to kill Hermannaric, they
stabbed him on the side in the skirmish, and the injury greatly weakened
him. Seeing this, the king of the Huns, who is named as Balamber,
launched a strike on the Germans. While the details of the Eastern
German-Hun conflict in this period remain murky, there are reports that
suggest that in 378 CE, the western Gothic branch of the Germans and the
Huns formed an alliance against the Romans. As a result, the Hun cavalry
came to the aid of the Germans at Adrianople in 378 CE and helped them
massacre the Roman legions. There are further reports of a
German-Hun-Iranic alliance raiding Roman provinces around this time and
other German-Hun alliances attacking the Romans a little later in the
early 380s of CE. In 384 CE, the Huns completed the conquest of much of
what is today Hungary, and their cavalry was raiding as far as Gaul.</p>
<p>Then, we hear that in 395 CE, a great Hun horde broke through the
Caucasus and invaded the Iranian empire as well as Roman provinces to
the south of Armenia. The force invading the Iranian empire is said to
have been led by two Hun commanders named Basich and Kursich, who
marching along the Tigris and Euphrates, eventually struck Ctesiphon
and, evading the Iranian army, passed through Azerbaijan back into the
steppes. Another branch of this horde launched a blitzkrieg on Syria and
then Anatolia. There is also a report of a Hunnic assault on the city of
Edessa during this invasion. There was soon talk of a Hun-Sassanian
alliance against the Christian Roman empire, but the Roman embassy
reached a peace agreement staving this invasion.</p>
<p>In 400 CE, we hear of a certain Uldin becoming the lord of the Huns. He
attacked the Germans led by a commander named Gainas, killed him, and
sent his head over to the Romans at Constantinople. In 404-405 CE,
taking advantage of the winter, Uldin invaded the Balkans and devastated
Thracia. In 408 CE, the Romans faced a crushing defeat at their hands
with heavy losses of men in Thracia. After that, the historical accounts
become murky again. However, in the 420s of CE, during the intra-Roman
wars, there appears to have been some kind of alliance between some
Roman factions and the Huns. Some Huns were operating as far as North
Africa as part of this alliance.</p>
<p>Some time in the second half of the
430s of CE, the Hun situation heats up again with the rise of two
brothers, Bleda first, and then Attila, the sons of Mundzuk, lord of the
Huns. Bleda seems to have first been the king of the Huns and, together
with Attila, led the invasion of Illyria around 441 CE. In 442 CE, the
Romans met defeat after defeat at the hands of the Huns in the Balkans,
and the Romans were forced to pay tribute to them. Around this time, an
intra-Hun conflict broke out, and Bleda was overthrown and possibly
killed in the early 440s by his brother Attila. Taking advantage of
this, the Romans stopped paying the tribute.</p>
<p>On taking over the Hun leadership, Attila first decided to set the
tribute situation right. He calculated the arrears to be 6000 pounds (?)
of gold and demanded that it be paid as a single lump sum. Not
surprisingly, this demand sparked the Roman-Hun war of 447 CE that went
badly for the Romans. Marcellinus Comes, the Illyrian states: “<em>In a
tremendous war, greater than the first one (the earlier Hun-Roman war of
the early 440s), Attila ground almost the whole Europe into the dust …
Attila came as far as Thermopylae. Arnegisclus (the Roman general from
Marcianople), after fighting bravely and killing many enemies, fell in a
battle against Attila near the river Utus in Dacia Ripensis.</em>” The
Christian Nestorius in course of trying to give a spin to the events as
a consequence of the lack of Abrahamistic dogma states: “<em>The barbarians
(Huns) were masters and the Romans slaves. Thus, the supremacy had
changed over to the barbarians.</em>” Callinicus adds: “<em>The barbarian
people of the Huns, the ones in Thracia, became so strong that they
captured more than a hundred cities and almost brought Constantinople
into danger, and most men fled from it … There was so much killing and
blood-letting that no one could number the dead. They pillaged the
churches and monasteries and slew the monks and nuns. And they
devastated the blessed [church] of Alexander [a Christian
“martyr”]</em>”.</p>
<p>This was the pinnacle of Hunnic power in Europe. While it is hard to
estimate the full extent of Attila’s empire or understand its
relationship to the Asian power center (he might have just been a
“viceroy” of the Khan — sort of like Batu or Hulegu to Mongke or
Qubilay), Priscus tells us that he was seen as the “<em>king, commander and
supreme judge of his people</em>” after the great victory of 447 CE.+++(4)+++
However, unlike with the Chingizid Mongols, the end came nearly as
precipitously as his rise. In 451 CE, Attila attacked the Germans in
Gaul and unexpectedly suffered heavy losses to his cavalry from the
resolute German counterattack. He then tried to make up for this by
invading Italy. During this phase, he met with some renewed success by
taking the fortified city of Aquileia, then Milan and Pavia. However,
with an epidemic raging in the ranks of the Huns and their German
allies, they had to retreat soon, allowing the Roman forces to
consolidate their defenses. With Attila’s death early in 453 CE, major
internal conflicts broke out among the Huns and their Germanic subjects.
In 467 CE, Dengizich, Attila’s son, fought desperately with the Germans
on the Danube but faced a major defeat. Two years later, the European
Hunnic power came to an end as Dengizich was beheaded by the German
Anagast, fighting on the Roman side. However, remnants of Hun power
appear to have persisted in the Caucasus, where we hear of Hun leaders
Glones and Styrax leading them against the Sabirs, who may have been a
Turkic group. Further east, the Kutrigurs and Utigurs may have also been
surviving Hunnic groups situated on the north shore of the Black Sea.</p>
<h2 id="the-affinities-of-the-huns-of-europe">The affinities of the Huns of Europe</h2>
<p>As we can see from the sources cited above, the Hunnic horde was a
multiethnic assemblage from the beginning of their record in Europe.
Priscus says: “<em>His (Attila’s) Scythian subjects were swept together
from many nations… Besides their own barbarian tongues, either Hunnish
or Gothic, they spoke Latin as many have dealings with the Western
Romans, but not one of them easily speaks Greek, except captives from
the Thracian or Illyrian frontier regions.</em>” One of the groups of this
assemblage is still prominent as the Germanic people in the regions the
Huns conquered in Europe. Attila’s last wife, Hildegund, was clearly a
German woman. Her tale is remembered (in a somewhat garbled form) in
surviving Germanic legends like Atlakviða of the Nordic Poetic Edda,
where she goes by the name Gudrun. Some Hunnic leaders seem to have
taken up Germanic names. Attila’s brother Bleda’s name seems to have
been derived from the Germanic name Blatbert. One of Attila’s generals
killed in the great showdown with the Germans was named Laudareiks —
clearly Germanic — probably a Germanic ally of the Huns. Another Hun
leader is named Ragnaris, again Germanic. Thus, there are multiple lines
of evidence that the Germanic folks were incorporated into the Hun horde
of Europe.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The Iranics no longer exist in Europe, but their long presence in the
region and the Roman empire is well-attested (e.g., the origin of Roman
Mithraism). Thus, their figuring in the Hunnic assemblage is also not a
matter of much surprise. Right from when the Huns were first noticed,
this association is stated, i.e., their conquest and absorption of the
Alani. Again, their presence in the Hunnic assembly is hinted by
Priscus’ usage of “Scythian subjects”. After the death of Attila in the
460s, the Hun were led by a certain Hormidac in a devastating assault on
Dacia. This is clearly a rendering of the Iranic name, Hormizdak, a name
also found among the Sassanian royalty. Iranic names are also seen among
the Kutrigur, like the Hun leader Zabergan who defended his land against
the Eastern Christian Roman attack in the 550s of CE. Likewise, Glones
might have also had a name of Iranic provenance.</p>
<p>This leaves us with the “original Hunnish” language — it was clearly
distinct from Iranic or Germanic and seemed to come from East Asia. It
is here that the greatest confusion exists, as nothing other than
personal names and a few terms have come down from that language, that
too mostly via Latin or Greek sources. The early experts tended to favor
a Turkic etymology for them. However, there was always a lingering doubt
among some researchers that it might belong to the larger Mongolic clade
after all. First, irrespective of whether Altaic languages are a
monophyletic group (there are many different formulations of this; for
the latest iteration, one can consult the work of Robbeets, who supports
the hypothesis under the name “Transeurasian”) or not, there is little
doubt that Turkic and Mongolic have closely interacted over a prolonged
period resulting in a substantial shared vocabulary. Hence, single words
that are given a Turkic etymology could be from a Mongolic source, after
all. But distinguishing these from Turkic is not trivial. For instance,
Attila’s father, Mundzuk reminds one of the second part of the name of
the Chingizid Mongol general Qizil Monchuk; however, the said general
could have been of Turkic ancestry. Second, there are some tantalizing
hints of clearly Mongolic etymologies.</p>
<p>Unraveling this is complicated because while we have the runic Turkic
inscriptions of the Gök (Blue) Turks, early Mongolic from the
corresponding period is poorly attested. Substantial Mongolic texts are
only available from the Chingizid period onward. But the extant Mongolic
is only the crown group of a larger extinct language family — the
greater Mongolic clade. That family included the language of the Khitan
who founded the Liao (in North China) and Qara Khitai empires. Though
many Khitan words are now known from bilingual texts with Chinese
equivalents, the Khitan language remains partly undeciphered (despite
the efforts of the Mongolic scholars led by Qīnggéěrtài in studying old
and newly discovered Khitan texts), posing yet another challenge for
understanding the early development of the greater Mongolic clade. The
greater diversity of these para-Mongolic languages from the greater
Mongolic clade is also hinted at by the original language of the <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/mongolica-the-tangut-empire/">Tangut
royal
family</a>,
the Tuoba clan, who descended from the leaders of the Xianbei
confederation. Long before the formation of the Tangut kingdom, the
para-Mongolic Tuoba clan, as the Khans of the Xianbei confederation held
sway approximately between the late 300s-500s of CE.+++(4)+++ This brings us
exactly to the time of the Hun activity in the West. In turn, this
suggests that there were already powers of the greater Mongolic clade
active in the East, making it possible that the Asian core of the Huns,
after all, had their origins among these greater Mongolic groups.</p>

584-587 CE) inscriptions in Mongolia, established that the Ruan-Ruan
Khanate, who displaced the Xianbei to establish as second “Hun”
Khaganate contained an elite who spoke a Mongolic language even closer
to the Chingizid Mongolian than the Khitan or Tuoba languages. They were
eventually displaced by the Blue Turks and moved westwards following the
trail of the earlier Huns all the way to Hungary as the Avar Khanate.
Given the evidence for a relationship between the Huns and the Avars
(see below), Vovin’s decipherment, if true, strengthens the idea that
the Asian core of the Huns and the Avars who came later were likely
Mongolic.</p>
<h2 id="the-huns-of-india-and-iran">The Huns of India and Iran</h2>
<p>This brings us to the elephant in the room — the relationship of the
European Huns to the other groups that go under the same name. Beginning
around the first half of the 450s of CE, a Huṇa force invaded India,
probably towards the very end of mahārāja Kumāragupta’s reign. We hear
from the inscriptions of his son, emperor Skandagupta, that he defeated
the Hūṇa-s in a fierce battle to restore the fortunes of the Gupta
empire (the Bhitari inscription). This first wave of Hūṇa-s is usually
identified with the horde established by the lord known as Kidara and is
known after him as the Kidarites. The Hūṇa incursions into India did not
stop with that. As the Gupta empire declined in the 490s as a second
wave of Huns, usually termed the Alchon Huns (Hara-hūṇa or the Red
Huns), invaded. These Huns had been raised to power in Central Asia in
the 430s by their lord Khingila. A successor of his, the Hūṇa king
Toramāṇa, broke through to briefly conquer large swaths of northern
India. The Gupta resistance against them continued from the East for
another 20-30 years with the main star of this fightback being mahārāja
Nṛsiṃhagupta Bālāditya. Toramāṇa was succeeded by his son Mihirakula who
lasted until around 530 CE.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a second nationalist resistance began in central India
under Prakāśadharman and his son Yaśodharman, the rising Aulikara kings.
By 528 CE Yaśodharman had defeated the Hūṇa-s and subjugated them — he
even mentions capturing the women of Mihirakula’s harem. However, new
Hūṇa invasions, now under a third horde, the Śveta-hūṇa (Hephthalites),
generally believed to be related to the Alchon Huns, continued until
around 606 CE. The Puṣyabhūti princes, Rājyavardhana and Harṣavardhana,
defeated them comprehensively and reduced the survivors to the vassal
province of the Hūṇamaṇḍala. While the Hūṇa-s who invaded India bear
unambiguously Iranic names, evidence from <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/notices-of-hu%e1%b9%87a-s-in-kavya-and-an-excursus-on-their-origins-and-ethnicity/">Sanskrit
sources</a>
hints that they had an East Asian genetic component and used the
characteristic horse ornaments of the eastern Central Asian groups.
Apart from the Hūṇamaṇḍala province, we hear of a very late mention of
the Huṇa-s in India during the reign of the Kalacuri king, Lakṣmī-karṇa,
in the 1050s of CE — his wife was the Hūṇa princess Avalla-devī — it
remains unclear if she was from the same Hūṇamaṇḍala or elsewhere (like
a śāhīya Hūṇa from Gandhāra, survivors of the old Alchons, fleeing the
Mohammedan horrors to inner India).</p>
<p>In parallel, the Sassanian empire had similar invasions by related Hūṇa
groups. The Kidarite Huns and the Iranians (the Iranians seem to have
called them the Red Huns) had a complex relationship. Having founded a
Central Asian state, probably centered at a mighty fort near Samarkand,
in the early phase of their career (350s of CE), the Kidarite Huns
invaded the eastern part of the Sassanian empire even as the great
Iranian shahanshah Shāpur-II was in the midst of the war with the
Romans. Shāpur-II had to turn to his rear and wage a nearly 5-year war
on these Huns before forcing them to sue peace. As a part of the deal,
they allied with the Iranians to fight the Romans. Thus, their lord
(probably named Krum-pat; c.f. the name of the later Bulgar Khan) aided
Shapur-II in major victories against the Romans. This association and
their occupation of the former Kuṣaṇa lands in Central Asia explains the
extensive Iranicization of these Hun groups. Based on the names of the
leaders, we can also see a degree of Hinduization of the later Kidarites
(e.g., Salanavīra and Vinayāditya). Down the line, the relationship
between the Iranians and these Huns soured again, and between 400-460
CE, the Iranians suffered multiple defeats against these Huns. Thus,
they were forced to pay tribute to the Kidarites along the lines of what
Attila levied on the Romans. In a parallel situation, when the Iranians
stopped the tribute, a major war broke out. In an expedient move, the
Sassanian shahanshah Phiroz formed an alliance with the rival Hun horde,
the Śveta-hūṇa-s, and, in the 460s of CE, overthrew the Kidarites who
were by then already greatly weakened by the Gupta assault.</p>
<p>What goes around comes around. Thus, in the 470s, the Śveta-hūṇa-s
aggressively turned against their erstwhile Iranian allies, forcing
Phiroz to war against them. In an engagement southeast of the Caspian,
in the old lands of the Dāsa-s (Hyrcania), the Iranians were smashed by
the Huns, and Phiroz was taken prisoner. He had to pay a heavy ransom
and prostrate himself before the Śveta-hūṇa lord Akhśunwar. He agreed to
do so, facing east in the morning, and claimed that he had actually only
bowed to the god Mithra. Stinging from this defeat, 4-5 years later,
Phiroz tried to reclaim the lost ground in a second campaign against the
Huns. The Iranian force was demolished again, Phiroz’s son was taken
hostage by the Huns, and he had to pay a hefty tribute. Now Akhśunwar
declared himself the shahanshah of the Sassanian empire and added the
Iranian crown on his head in his coins. To add insult to injury, Phiroz
had to pay a huge amount to get his son released. At the same time,
taking advantage of his routs, Judaistic and Christian subversionists
were causing unrest in parts of the Iranian empire. Smarting from his
prior defeats, Phiroz thirsted for revenge, but his forces were
reluctant to fight the Huns again. Yet, Phiroz pressed ahead for a war
with the Huns in 484 CE with the cream of the Iranian army south of the
Caspian. Akhśunwar lured them into a hidden trap in the form of a
concealed ditch while feigning retreat and claiming not wanting to
initiate hostilities. Phiroz fell into the ditch in wild pursuit of the
Huns and was killed by their archers. Many of his brothers, sons, and
several of the Iranian elite were also slain as they attempted to aid
him. Phiroz’s surviving brother then successfully rallied with their
chief generals to defend the Iranian core from the Huns. However, the
Huns helped overthrow him and placed Phiroz’s son, who was earlier their
hostage, as a more pliant ruler on the throne. It took the Sassanians
about 80 years to recover their losses and eventually overthrow
Śveta-hūṇa-s under shahanshah Kushrau-I in an alliance with the Blue
Turks.</p>
<h2 id="the-huns-of-the-east">The Huns of the East</h2>
<p>Some historians have long recognized that there must be a common basis
for these groups with a shared ethnonym operating across the breadth of
Eurasia in the same general period. Moreover, their mode of action with
respect to the settled empires of India, Iran and Rome shows striking
parallels. Notably, there are other indications of the connections
between these groups. For example, Kidarite coins have been found in
Eastern Europe and Hungary, where the Attilan Huns operated.+++(4)+++ Further,
Priscus tells us that the Kidarites were the Chionites, an alternative
term for the Huns with deep roots to the East (see below). To understand
this, we have to look further East and farther back in time to around
250 BCE. Simultaneously with the ascent of the nationalist Cīna empire
of the Chin, the peoples of the Mongolian steppe appear to have started
consolidating. Part of this might have been driven by technologies they
acquired from their Indo-Iranian neighbors. Another factor seems to have
been the Chinese unification, which started threatening their existence
with wall-building activities of Chin Shi Huang and aggressive military
action the Chin took against the peoples of Mongolia in 215 CE.</p>
<p>The first organization appears to have occurred under a leader named Touman.
His son Modun (probably Bagatur in the original Mongolic language)
Shanyu appears to have unified them and began a series of expansive
campaigns to build the first great Mongolian empire of the steppes in
history. The memory of this old empire lasted to the times of Chingiz
Khan, <a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/mongolica-chingiz-khan-and-the-rest/">who referred to the ancient times of the
Shanyu</a>.
These first Mongolic conquerors were known to the Chinese as Xiongnu, a
word likely pronounced as something similar to Hūṇa and perhaps
something like (C)hunu in a Mongolic language. This, in turn, is close
to the name Chuni occasionally used for the European Huns and Chionite,
who Priscus says were the Kidarites. This suggests that the Xiongnu were
indeed the “original” Huns and strengthens the linkage between these
ancient groups across Eurasia.</p>
<p>After a long struggle with the Hans, the Mongolian core of this first
empire of the Xiongnu appears to have fallen to the para-Mongolic
Xianbei group sometime between 150-200 CE, and the survivors fled West
into the Saka and Kuṣāṇa lands. This suggests that the demise of the old
Xiongnu empire resulted in the westward movement of its people and their
mixing with various steppe Iranic groups while carrying the Hun
ethnonym. The Kidarite takeover of the Kuṣaṇa lands in Central Asia is
attested both in coinage and Cīna historical records. Over time, the
Iranic components might have become dominant in some of these Hunnic
hordes. It is even possible that the very title Khagan is derived from
the Iranic hva-kama (=“self-ruler”) and was transmitted back eastwards
to Mongolia. As they moved further West, they started absorbing
Germanic, possibly Slavic, and also other tribes (see below). The
connections of some of the more Western groups, like the Śveta-hūṇa-s,
to the Eastern ones, continued via the Central Asian borderlands: as
noted above, the Xianbei confederation was displaced by Ruan-Ruan
Khanate, who were probably derived from underling Xiongnu, who persisted
under the former. In the 490s, the Hephthalites and the Ruan-Ruan
Khanate formed an alliance (probably based on their old familial
connections according to Golden) and conquered the Turkic horde of the
Teleuts (T’ieh-le). Then, the Hephthalites again allied with the
Ruan-Ruan Khanate to strike their arch-enemies, the Xianbei kingdom of
the Northern Wei. Around 520 CE, the Ruan-Ruan Khan turned against his
powerful uncle, a brāhmaṇa minister whose sister was married to the
former Khan. This brāhmaṇa’s other sisters were married to the king of
the Hephthalites. In a change of alliances, the Hephthalites then aided
this brāhmaṇa in Kokonor in the drawn-out struggle against the Ruan-Ruan
and the Xianbei.</p>
<h2 id="the-hungarians">The Hungarians</h2>
<p>While Attila is remembered mostly negatively both in the Christian
Occident and the Germanic historical lore, he is a national hero for the
Hungarians even after their conversion to the cult of Jesus. This seems
to be a rather deep memory given the time that has elapsed since the
Hunnic conquest of Hungary. However, we should note that this memory was
likely reinforced by the Avar Khanate that arose from the overthrow of
the Ruan-Ruan by the Blue Turks and the Hephthalites by the
Sassanian-Blue Turk alliance. A horde of these neo-Hunnic peoples moved
West under the Khans Kandik and Bayan, just as the classical European
Huns before them, and erupted into Eastern Europe and Hungary starting
around the 550s of CE. Over the next 60 years, they rose in power,
forming shifting alliances with Germans, such as the Langobardi and also
the Slavs, to subjugate a vast territory from the steppes of the Black
Sea-Caspian regions to nearly the gates of Vienna. This brought them
into prolonged conflict with the Eastern Roman empire, in course of
which they allied themselves with the Iranians and launched a striking
attack on Constantinople in 617 CE. Over the next 100 years, their power
declined, and they were eventually defeated by the Frankish crusade and
the Slavs. The survivors were converted to the second Abrahamism
thereafter.</p>
<p>Despite the memories of these Hunnic connections, the extant Hungarians
speak an Uralic language. There is no evidence for this being the
language of the Huns or the Avars who followed them. This is also in
stark contrast with much of the surrounding regions, which speak
Indo-European languages — predominantly of the Germanic, Slavic and
Albanian branches. So how did the Hungarians come to speak an Uralic
language? While this is not the place to get into the debates of the
cladogenesis of the Uralic languages, it can be confidently said that
the Hungarian language is not closest to the other Uralic languages of
Northern Europe, like Estonian, Finnish, Karelian, or Saami. Nor is it
specifically related to the Eastern European Uralic tongues like those
of the Mari, the Udmurts and the Mordovians. Instead, it is closer to
the Siberian languages Mansi and Khanty that are spoken to the East of
the Urals. This linguistic observation by itself points out that the
language of the Hungarians has come from some other group that invaded
Europe from the East.</p>
<p>Historical records vindicate this conclusion. After the destruction of
the Avar Khanate in Hungary, there was a further invasion from the East
by a group known as the “conquering Hungarians” led by the Magyars. The
first mentions of them on the eastern fringes of Europe are seen through
the 800s of CE. Around 862 CE for of Magyars launched a raid on Central
Europe. They returned 20 years later, sacking Germanic lands as far as
Vienna. Close to 890 CE, the Hungarians launched a major westward
thrust, probably triggered by the conflicts between the Turkic khanates
of the Khazars and the Pechenegs. Shortly thereafter, they crushed the
Slavs in what is today the Hungary region and established themselves
there. In the first decade of the 900s, they advanced rapidly, smashing
a Frankish German army in Slovakia and cleared the path for more
extensive conquests. Over the next 50 years, the Germans suffered defeat
after defeat at the hands of the Magyars, who led spectacular raids
covering what are today Spain, France, Germany, Poland, the Balkans and
the Eastern Roman territories of Europe. Finally, in 955 CE, the
Hungarians were annihilated by a fierce German counterattack near what
is today Augsburg, Germany, and the Magyar leaders were captured and
executed. The survivors held on to Hungary and were eventually converted
to Christianity and “accepted as Europeans”. This still leaves us with
the conundrum of why the Hungarians, who have acquired their language
from a distinct eastern conquering group, which invaded long after the
classical Huns, still recall the Hunnic connection.</p>
<h2 id="genomics-of-the-huns-avars-and-hungarians">Genomics of the Huns, Avars and Hungarians</h2>
<p>Historical hypotheses and reconstructions are often hard to corroborate
due to the incompleteness of the records. However, over the past two
decades, genomics is providing us with a serious independent mechanism
for testing various historical hypotheses. Its spectacular success was
seen in resolving many aspects of the first great expansions from the
steppes, i.e., that of the Indo-Europeans. It is also providing deep
insights into the situation of the next set of expansions from the
steppes, namely that of the Hunnic, Turkic and later Mongolic peoples.
The Hungarian conundrum is another place where genomics can be brought
to bear. The initial genetic studies on the extant Uralic peoples (e.g.,
by Tambets et al.) only deepened this mystery. They showed that the
“pure” Uralic ancestry is largely restricted to the easternmost Siberian
groups like the Nganasans. That, too, is mainly restricted to the
Y-chromosome. However, the mitochondrial genome shows some European
admixture. In contrast, as one moves West, there is increasing European
admixture in all Uralic groups, and it is clearly more in terms of the
mitochondrial genomes, suggesting that the Uralic movements to the West
were likely mediated by males who took local females. Strikingly, even
though the majority of the Y-chromosomes of the Khanty and the Mansi
(Siberian sister groups of the Hungarians) are of Uralic affinity is
only a very small minority in the Hungarians. The Uralic signal is
nearly invisible in the Hungarians in terms of the mitochondrial genome.
While the same is seen in the mitochondrial genomes of the Estonians and
the Finns, their male lines respectively show a large or a majority
Uralic fraction. This means that though the Hungarians acquired the
language of their conquering national founders, their extant genome is
of mostly Germanic ancestry. Thus, the Magyar conquerors hardly left a
genetic impact. This means that the extant Hungarian genomic sequences
are not sufficient to answer questions of the ethnogenesis of the
founders of the nation or their connection to the Huns.</p>
<p>Here is where a recent preprint published by Maróti et al. becomes
crucial in clarifying Hungarian ethnogenesis and the complex
relationships between the various steppe groups. They obtained human
genomic sequences from 271 ancient samples from Great Hungarian Plain
and 73 direct C14 dates. Thus, they have a collection spanning the
Hunnic, Avar and Magyar periods, which can help probe the above issues.
They found that the majority of the samples had European ancestry,
suggesting that the invaders did not greatly alter the local ancestry,
unlike the Indo-European invasions, which left much deep genetic
imprints in both Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>However, they strikingly found a subset of both the Hun and Avar age
samples forming a cline in the principal component analysis that went
from the Germanic-type European ancestry on one end to the
Turko–Mongolic East Asian ancestry on the other. Notably, on the East
Asian end of the cline, two of their Hungarian Huns group tightly with
the Kalmyks and the Mongols, among extant populations, and the close to
two historical Hun samples, namely a Hun from Kurayly, Kazakhstan from
380 CE and a Tian Shan Hun. Modeling this ancestry suggested a major
late Xiongnu component marked by Han admixture. They could model one
further sample as having Xiongnu and Germanic or Sarmatian (a steppe
Iranic group close to the Alani) ancestry, pointing to the admixtures
indicated by the historical records. In an independent study, Veeramah
et al. looked at the genetic affinities of individuals from Sarmatian
and other graves across western Eurasia. Interestingly, one early
Sarmatian individual from the Orenburg region of Russia (~400-200 BCE)
and a Crimean individual (200-400 CE) with a deformed skull in the style
of the Alchon Huns show specific evidence for Indian admixture with SNPs
potential private to greater India. This suggests that, as in the
earlier phase of the Aryan invasion of India, there were individuals
from the subcontinent who were also entering the steppe hordes. This
provides independent genetic support for historical records such as the
brāhmaṇa, who was allied with the Hephthalites and the Ruan-Ruan
Khanate.+++(4)+++ Thus, the Hunnic movement through Asia into Europe, while
having its ultimate origins in Mongolia, swept in a wide range of
ancestries on their path. The Avar age samples formed an Europe-East
Asia cline entirely overlapping with the Hunnic samples. Several Early
Avar and a few Middle Avar age samples group with the Huns, Xiongnu,
Xianbei, some early Turkic, and Chingizid Mongol samples at the East
Asian end of the cline. These Avars at the East Asian end of the cline
show a specific Ancient North-East Asian admixture that was also noted
among the early Xiongnu, Ulaanzuukh, and Slab Grave samples from
Mongolia. This establishes the Mongolian origins of the Avars and
supports their deep shared ancestry with the Xiongnu.</p>
<p>In terms of Y chromosomes (also see earlier work of Keyser et al.), both
the Hunnic and Avar male samples from this Hungarian study shows a
presence of the Q haplogroup, which was also found in East Asian Xiongnu
samples, such as those from the spectacular Middle Xiongnu Tamir Ulaan
Khoshuu cemetery at the confluence of the Tamir and the Orkhon Rivers in
Central Mongolia. Additionally, both these Hungarian samples also show
the same R1a Y haplogroup that was widely dispersed across Asia by the
Indo-Iranians. The presence of this haplogroup in the above Middle
Xiongnu cemetery males in Mongolia suggests that a major fraction of
these were not derived from later absorption of Indo-Iranians on the
western steppes.+++(4)+++ Rather, this male line likely descended from the
Middle-Late Bronze age Indo-Iranian Andronovo horizon that had expanded
into the Mongolian steppe. Consistent with this, we find mentions of
some of these steppe Indo-Iranians in the Xianbei successor states down
to the Chingizid period as the Aran or Asud (&lt;arya). It also indicates
that the male line of these old Indo-Iranians persisted through the
“Mongolization” of the East, especially among the Hunnic elites (e.g.,
the 2000-year-old Xiongnu elite cemetery at Duurlig Nars in Northeast
Mongolia studied by Kim et al.). The recovery of these Y-chromosomes in
the Hungarian Huns suggests that the male lines of these elites were
likely still in action centuries later in the West.+++(4)+++ These observations
further strengthen the connection between these groups from the two ends
of the Eurasian landmass.</p>
<p>Finally, coming to the conquering Hungarian elite samples, Maróti et al.
found that they show a more spread out distribution on their PCA plot.
Few of them squarely fall in the above-described Hun and Avar clines
shifted towards Western Eurasian groups with respect to the easternmost
members of these clines. This suggests that a minority subset of the
Magyars were indeed derived without any further admixture from a Hunnic
group that had already mixed with steppe Iranic groups to their West.
However, the major clusters of the Magyars show a further shift towards
the Siberian groups, namely the Mansi, the Selkup and the Yukagir (the
former two are unambiguous Uralic speakers). Remarkably, these ancient
Magyar samples also show close genetic affinities to the peoples of
Bashkortostan in what is today Uralic Russia. Medieval Hungarian records
from the 1200s mention this land as the ancestral domain of the Magyars
of Hungary. The authors found that the Magyar elite with Uralic ancestry
could be modeled as a mixture of Mansi up to 50%, with the rest being
made of late Xiongnu and Iranic Sarmatian ancestry. Based on these
admixtures, they posit that there was an initial admixture between the
ancient Sarmatians and an Uralic group close to the Mansi around 643-431
BCE and later with the Huns around 217-315 CE, even as the remnants of
the Xiongnu empire were moving West.</p>
<p>This fits well the inferences from linguistic data. The Hungarian
language is a sister of the Mansi language, which suggests that an
Uralic group was central to the ethnogenesis of the original Magyars.
This has now been independently supported by the archaeo-genomic
evidence, filling lacuna from the paucity of such ancestry in extant
Hungarians. The Hungarian language shows clear Iranic loans relative to
Mansi and Khanty, indicating that they had contact with the Iranics. The
genetic evidence suggests that this happened around 500 BCE when a
steppe Iranic group related to the Sarmatians (Avestan: Sairima)
probably moved into the Uralic zone and were absorbed by a Mansi-like
group. This contact left both a genetic and linguistic impact on this
Uralic group. It also probably introduced elements of a steppe nomad
lifestyle and warfare to these proto-Magyars (since there is no evidence
of their sister groups engaging in similar military nomadism). This
priming was probably reinforced as a Hunnic group originating from the
fragments of the Xiongnu empire, which had also mixed with steppe Iranic
elements, was absorbed into the proto-Magyars in steppe-Siberian
borderlands. It is likely that this proto-Magyar group had participated
as an auxiliary of the European Hun and Avar invasions because few of
the Magyar elite were plainly Hunnic without much Uralic admixture. This
is consistent with the accounts of the Magyar military tactics, which
are frequently compared to those of the Huns and Avars. Thus, we
probably had a situation where the proto-Magyars retained the Uralic
language of their demographically dominant Mansi-like core but also
inherited legends of the old heroes, like Attila, from the Hunnic
peoples embedded their midst.+++(5)+++ This might explain the importance of
Attila and his successors in their national consciousness (c.f. Geser
Khan epics in the East).</p>
