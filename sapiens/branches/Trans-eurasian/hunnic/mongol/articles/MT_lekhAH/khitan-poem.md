A poem by a chIna ambassador (translated by Pursey) on the Khitan court in 1090 CE. Evidently, it was when their Khaghan was camping in the Gobi desert -- a harsh land where strong folk are made.


In winter savage tents set up in the the desert,  
Penned in together with a fence of cloth and reeds, it is called the “moving palace.”  
The officials who follow are scattered like stars among dunes that look like burial mounds,  
These cave-like tent abodes are bullied by the frosty wind.
