title = "qubilai-ministers"

Rashid ad-din provides a list of 54 top officials of the Mongol empire during Qubilai Khan's reign: 21 of these are ministers; 30 are military commanders; 19 belong to the Khan's imperial guard. Many played more than one role hence the count goes over 54. e.g., Bayan& Turtaqa Noyan were both ministers& commanders. Bolad was both a minister & member of the imperial guard as the bauarchi -- a function overlapping with the imperial chef. 

5 of the 54 were marUnmatta-s drawn from the conquered lands appointed mostly as ministers & members of the imperial guard. This was to prove costly for the Mongols down the line, much as it did for the "secular" vijayanagara. +++(??)+++ 

3 of the 54 of were Hans. The remaining 46 were mostly Mongols & with a few Turks. Marco Polo was not part of the list & a minor figure contrary to his self-perception.

Thus, while the Mongols were open to external talent they seem to have largely kept the highest rungs of the government to themselves. Below this rung there was much more incorporation of non-Mongol talent.

Not surprisingly, the descendants of Bo'ghorchu, Muqali & Subedei etc held high ranks as generals & the imperial guard. These were among the highest-ranked generals of Chingiz himself & transmitted their talent genetically to their sons & sometimes up to great-grandsons.
