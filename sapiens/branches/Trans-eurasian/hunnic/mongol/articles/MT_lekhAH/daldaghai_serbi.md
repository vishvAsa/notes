Khaghan Daldaghai of the Serbi was like a Chingiz Khan forgotten to history. He was remembered by his Khitan descendants with much respect over 700 years later. 

He captured 1000 families of Japanese and made them his fishermen. Hou Han Shu's provides an account of his attack on the Japanese: 

> "In the first year of the Kuang-ho reign period [178 A.D.]… The tribe’s [i.e. the Serbi’s] population was increasing daily, and their crops, livestock, and wild game were not enough to provide sustenance. 
> 
> T’an-shih-huai (Daldaghai)  thereupon personally traveled all around and saw the wide Wu-hou-Ch’in River [i.e., Lao-ha River]. He followed the river for 100 li to a place where the river water did not flow. In the river were fish, but he was unable to catch them. 
> 
> He heard that the Wa people were skilled at net fishing, so they went east and attacked the Country of the Wa People (Japan), obtaining over 1,000 families and moving them to the Ch’in [Wu-hou-ch’in] River, ordering them to fish as a means of helping supplement their [i.e. the Serbi’s] grain and other food supplies"
