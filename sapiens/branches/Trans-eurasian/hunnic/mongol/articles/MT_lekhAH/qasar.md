The verses of Jamuqa describing Chingiz Khan's brother Qasar, who he appears to have held in great regard as a warrior. 


> His body is three fathoms high,
And he dines on three-year old cattle;  
Wearing a three-layered armour,
He is pulled along in his cart by three bulls.  
When he swallows a man complete with quiver,  
It does not get stuck in his throat.  
When he gulps down a whole man,
It does not fill his stomach.  
>
> When he is angry and draws his bow,  
And releases a angqu'a (dvi-mukha) arrow,  
He shoots and pierces ten or twenty men  
Who are beyond a mountain;
>
> When he draws his bow and releases  
A keyibür (long-range; sūcīmukha) arrow,  
He shoots and pierces through his enemies,  
The ones he fights  
Who are beyond the steppe.  
>
> When he shoots, drawing his bow to the full,
He covers nine hundred fathoms;  
When he shoots, drawing it only a little,  
He covers five hundred fathoms.
>
> Different from all other men,  
He was born a coiling dragon-snake.  
His name is Joči Qasar.


(angqu’a is two-headed arrow; The Mongol scholar Onon mentions that it is also called achitu-sumu; wonder if that word was derived from the Khitan language.)

His name Qasar is, interesting one of the two mythical heavenly dogs of the Mongols, the other is Basar. They are believed to have emerged from the eggs of a celestial bird & are invoked to this date by the shamans of the Mongolized Khitans, the Dagur. This cynolatory of the Mongols is shared with the mid-autumn dog sacrifice & dogs of the afterlife of the Khitan. The also figure as the Aq Köpek and Aq Qasar of the heathen Turks.

Going farther back in time, they bring to mind the cynolatory in the earlier steppe traditions of the Indo-Iranians, with their celestial dogs identified with the two constellations.  Also, the dog sacrifice in the ashvamedha.
