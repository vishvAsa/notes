Regarding Qubilai Khan in Fridman's interview with J Weatherford: IMO, JW considerably downsizes Qubilai. He had challengers among the descendants of Chingiz Khan, his own brother Ariq BÃ¶ke and the Qaidu, both of whom declared themselves as rival Khans. Nevertheless, Qubilai completing the Mongol conquest of China was an achievement of the highest order. We disagree with JW downplaying it and Qubilai. 

Our previous note on this remarkable campaign:

Do the Japanese deserve much credit for the failure of the Mongol campaigns against Japan ? Again we tend see it as more of good luck for them.
