The Mongol emperor Qubilai Khan chose the chIna name for his dynasty, Yuan (元), from a chIna book, the Yijing:

大哉乾元  
 Dà zāi qián yuán  

A machine-aided translation:  
大    Dà     Great  
哉    zāi     Indeed!   
乾    Qián The Qián hexagram: represents Heaven/Cosmic force (like R^ita of the H)  
元     Yuán Origin/Beginning   

Full Meaning: "Great indeed is the Primal Origin of the Cosmic force!"

The Qián hexagram has great significance in chIna thought and is taken to represent the Yang principle in the Yin-Yang diagram. 

In the character for Qián 乾:

1. The Left side (𠦝): This is an ancient version of "sunrise" symbol with rays of light coming through trees. It represents energy and vitality.
2. The Right side (乞/乙): This represents "rising vapor" or "breath."
3. Combined: It suggests the sun rising and drawing the water to the sky as a powerful, upward-moving force.

Clearly, the Khan put some philosophical thought into choosing his dynastic appellation.

The historical trajectory of the Da Yuan was almost a metaphor for life itself.
