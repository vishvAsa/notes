The lament of the end of the empire: The Chingizid Mongol historian Saghang Sechen records a tragic poem of the last imperial Khan Toghon Temur on the end of their empire. Would there be such a reflection when the mahAmlechCha empire ends?

My vast and noble capital, my Dadu,  
my splendidly adorned and you my cool and delicious summer-seat, my Shangdu-Keibung.  
You, also, Yellow Plain of Shangdu, delight of my godlike ancestors.  
I suffered myself to drop into dreams - and lo my empire was gone.  
Ah! you my Dadu, built of navaratna-s,  
Ah! my Shangdu-Keibung, the union of all perfection
Ah my Fame.  
Ah my glory as Khaghan and Lord of the Earth.  
When I used to awake betimes and look forth,  
how the breezes blew loaded with fragrances.  
And turn which way I would all was glorious perfection of beauty.  
Alas for my illustrious name as the Khaghan of the World.  
Alas for my Dadu, seat of Sanctity,  
glorious work of the Immortal Qubilai!  
All, all is rent from me.
