The route of Chingiz Khan's remarkable western campaign with the strike on Samarqand as recorded by his ministers the Khitan Yelü Chucai & the Uighur Qaraiqachi Buyiruq. It is notable that after descending from the Irtysh, he followed a path close to that of the Khitan Khan Yelü Dashi's strike on the Army of Islam led by the Turk Sanjar. This makes one think if Yelü Chucai was had preserved a memory of his ancestors' western campaign & Chingiz modeled his own after that.
