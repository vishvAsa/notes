## Möngke Tengri-yin küchün-dür
The Mongol phrase: Möngke Tengri-yin küchün-dür; Qaghan-u suu-dur: By the might of the eternal Tengri, by the charisma of the Qaghan. That translation of suu-dur as by charisma is by M.Biran others mostly translate as the good fortune following a chIna rendering. Perhaps she is capturing a genuine element in this rendering -- the Khaghan's charisma coming from Tengri was something the Mongols actually experienced and saw it as an important element of their success.
