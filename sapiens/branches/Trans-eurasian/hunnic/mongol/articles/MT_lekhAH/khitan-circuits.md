The 5 circuits of the Khitan state the height of their power ~1100s. Each circuit had its own capital; the Khan did not stay in any 1 capital & moved around in the ancestral nomadic fashion. Sometimes he wandered in disguise in cities/towns to gather public opinion first hand. 

It is interesting that the Khitans &Mongols called their campsites in course of the wanderings as nat-pat or nand-bat from Skt nandi-pada = stop for refreshment or recreation. An example of an account of the Khitan Khaghan's nat-pat.

> The winter nat-pat was called Kuang-p'ing Tien. Here it was flat and surrounded in the distance by sandbanks. There were plenty of dunes. It is rather warm in the winter and the Khaghan usually spent his winter days here. On most days he held political councils with high officials from the Northern and Southern Circuits. Sometimes on leisure days he went out hunting. Or he took part in military exercises [with the army]. During this time the Khaghan received presents and tributes from the [ambassadors] Sung and other nations.
