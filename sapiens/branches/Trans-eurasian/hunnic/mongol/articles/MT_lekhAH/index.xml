Who therefore can think of this as&#xA;death, seeing that no-one thinks it calls for vengeance?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are&#xA;surprisingly common: there are something like 16 million carriers.+++(5)+++ The&#xA;analysts who discovered this (Zerjal et al) concluded the men with these&#xA;Y-chromosomes are the direct male-line descendants of Genghis Khan, the&#xA;Master of Thrones and Crowns. They have to be right: no one else&#xA;conquered such a vast empire and had his sons (and their sons, and so&#xA;on) rule and enjoy their harems for centuries. More than that, the&#xA;Golden Family continued to have high social status long after the fall&#xA;of the dynasties, even into recent times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The 800th anniversary of the great khuriltai of 1206</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/10/14/the-800th-anniversary-of-the-great-khuriltai-of-1206/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the year of the Tiger (1206 CE). At the head waters of the Onon&#xA;River, at the foot of the sacred mountain of Burkhan Khaldun, in&#xA;northern Mongolia a great throng of humanity was assembling. Jamuqa, the&#xA;once aristocratic leader of the Jadaran tribe had been executed and&#xA;there was one master of all Mongolia- Temujin. Thousands of horses,&#xA;sheep and cattle were herded in and enormous lines of felt gers (tents)&#xA;stretched in long lines leading to the grand central tent. In front of&#xA;that grand ger was erected the tall black horse-hair sulde, the magical&#xA;banner of the great warrior. The court shamans led by Teb Tengri were&#xA;getting into ecstatic séances to the eerie beat of the Mongolian drums.&#xA;Then there were the games- archery competitions, horse races and&#xA;wrestling and in the evening by the high fires the dances and throat&#xA;singing. Then on this great day the Master of all Mongolia, was lead to&#xA;the podium with his sulde in front of him. Then Temujin strode regally&#xA;on to a black felt carpet and his chief generals Bo’orchu, Muqali,&#xA;Jelme, Subedei, Jurchedei, Jebe and others raised him on that carpet&#xA;before the several thousands that were waiting for this moment. Temujin&#xA;was declared Chingiz(Chingis) Kha’khan- (Chin means strong, others say&#xA;Chingiz meant oceanic) the mighty ruler. Nine white horse tail banners&#xA;were raised. The announcer shouted that he was elected the supreme ruler&#xA;of the Turko-Mongol tribes and said that his power was derived from the&#xA;great god Köke Möngke Tengri. The announcer went on that the great Köke&#xA;Möngke Tengri had made Chingis Kha’Khan the law giver and the ruler of&#xA;all tribes and that he was ruling by the decree of the great tengri.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of Khan Abu’l Khair</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/05/29/the-rise-and-fall-of-khan-abul-khair/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An instructive lesson is offered by the eventful life of the Khan Abu’l Khair. The first son of Chingiz Kha’Khan was Jochi who founded the great Western hordes of the Mongols. His principal son was Batu who led the Mongol army during its great conquest of Europe. Batu and his brother Berke founded the Golden and White hordes of Jochid Ulus. The Golden and the White hordes were re-unified by the vigorous action of Khan Toqtamish, who also invaded Lithuania and subjugated it. Jochi’s other son Shayban had also distinguished himself in the great European campaign. At the time of Chingiz Kha’Khan death Shayban was alloted an Ulus (The Blue Horde) beside those of his above brothers East and Southeast of the Ural river including the province of Aktyubinsk. Shayban and his successors roamed in the territory bounded by the the Ural mountains and the Rivers Ilek and Irgiz, a tributaries of the Ural and wintered near the Sary Su river steppes. While the Shaybanids were not a major and remained obscure till the mid-1300s they held their territory against competing Mongol Khans from the White horde. In the mid-1300, an energetic Khan Uzbek stabilized and unified the disintegrating Ulus of Shayban. Subsequently, the other Jochid hordes collapsed as result of the expansion of Timur-i-lang and the Chingizids appeared to be receding into the background of the steppes. However, the fecundity of Chingiz Kha’Khan line revived its fortunes. All of a sudden the Shaybanids of the Blue Horde came to the fore. In 1428 at the age of 17, a young warrior Abu’l Khair was elected Khan of the Blue Horde in a Quriltai held on the Tura, west of Tobolsk in Siberia. After bowing to the Yak tail totem he proclaimed to restore the glory of Chingiz Khan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some great men from other cultures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/24/some-great-men-from-other-cultures/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some great men transcend cultural boundaries and simply amaze you with the sheer enormity of their acts. In my opinion these first among these is the great Mongol leader Chingiz Kha’Khan. If anyone comes close to complete success then it is none other than the great Kha’Khan. Literally from rags after his father was killed by the Tatars he created a super-power nation, defeating in a two front war, Islam and China. Even the modern superpower with its entire panoply would not survive a two front war on both these fronts. His surge through Central Asia was studded with an unbroken string of victories in all kinds of circumstances, that no military leader after him has ever been able repeat. Not only that he set up an entire nation with administration, writing, currency and a postal system, where none existed before. Most importantly, he became the most prolific progenitor of Central Asia. And all this was achieved after being tied down in Mongolia in tribal conflicts till the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/08/19/the-death-of-chingiz-khakhan/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the New moon day in August in 1227 AD the greatest of the military leaders of all times Chingiz Kha’Khan died. Born Temujin, and elected Kha’Khan- the Oceanic or mighty khan in 1206, destroyed in a span of 21 years the hegemony of China and Islam, two of the most dangerous powers in human history. This was very often done by waging war on both the fronts, something which, even superpowers like the United States today cannot really sustain if it were pitted against these same powers. Furthermore, this rise of Chingiz should be placed in the background of his immediate ancestors like Yessugai, Kabul and Kutula who while noted for their valor had no more an impact on the Central Asian history than any of the other khans who came and went. The other Turko-Mongol expansions such as the Huns of Motun-Tegin, the Uighurs of Tengri Bögü Kha’Khan and Gök Turks of Kül-tegin and Qapaghan khan were nowhere near Chingiz Khan in the organizational effort or result of their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/11/20/warrior-on-the-steppe/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Toqta Qiya had won many great battles and captured much territory. He was a better archer and a better swordsman than Urus Khan. Yet Urus Khan dominated the steppes due to his larger force and more reliable warriors. Toqta Qiya had earlier collaborated with Urus Khan, but he then broke off to establish his on Khanate. Now he was in a struggle with Urus in a low level conflict, but they still occassionally got together to raid the Russians. The fortress of Kesh was a long standing desire of Toqta Qiya. He had seen Urus and many other lesser warriors including some of his ex-naukers storm it and carry away heavy booty from the Chinese merchants. Yet, he had attempted to storm it on four occassions in four years and met with a crushing defeat on each occassion. On one occassion he thought he had taken the fort when his horse was shot under him and he barely escaped with life. On another occassion he tried a bold assault in winter and was flipped on his back by a blow from a club and nearly died on the snow. In the most recent attempt he had carefully sapped the fort for nearly 2 months and having picked up heavy booty from the Chinas was trying to get out when he was knocked over by a horse-shoe-headed arrow and fell badly wounded to the ground. He barely got out with his life. Now Toqta Qiya was offered a lesser province of Shadman, by Urus if he gave up his designs on Kesh for good. Alternatively, he faced a direct invasion from Urus and his allies like Suyurghatmish. Should he settle for Shadman or fight the battle of his life and hold his dignity. He could even lose his life in the latter option while he would at least have Shadman in the former. He was unable to decide. As though to mock him, fate had it that just then his lowly ex-nauker Narikeyan sacked Kesh and annexed to the Oezbeg Horde. For a winner of so many great the little stronghold of Kesh held the scales between a petty transient chief and a great Khan who transcended time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A 🧵returning to some themes relating to Altaic Khaganates. For a general background one can read this summary we wrote (&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/01/30/huns-uralics-and-empires-of-the-steppe/&#34;&gt;Huns, Uralics, and empires of the steppe&lt;/a&gt;) recently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One development that has happened since is the publication of another paper on multiple genomes from the Avar Khagnate. I began my first serious foray into Altaic history by reading René Grousset&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Empire of the steppes&amp;rdquo; and Chingiz Khan. It is fashionable these days, even though they have written no sweeping history like his, for modern Altaic scholar to crap on Grousset as otiose. Whatever our current improvements in understanding, I still feel it is important to read &amp;amp; appreciate the pUrvAchArya-s. The thrill of reading Grousset cover to cover as a kid is 1 of those indelible feelings &amp;ndash; it was followed by many an afternoon of wandering as though on horseback thinking about the various hypothesis of the ethnogenesis, warfare &amp;amp; cultural achievements of the people of the steppe going back to our own Aryan ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Order of Chingiz Khan&amp;rsquo;s 9 children through his 1st wife Börte (sons in brackets):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Qojin&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Jochi)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Chaghatai)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Ögedei)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Checheyigen&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Alaqa&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tümelün&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;(Tolui)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Al Altan&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4 sons + 5 daughters who survived to adulthood AFAI can tell; don&amp;rsquo;t know if any others died young. Good success for  her. Börte joined the Khan ~1178 CE around age 18. She bore her first daughter around 20 &amp;amp; was kidnapped around 21-22 which resulted in the uncertainty of the paternity of Jochi. Al Altan was born ~1196 CE. That would mean she was ~36 then, close to the limit of safe child-bearing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chingiz origin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A form of the word Chingiz (spelt in many popular roman orthographies as Chinggis) is first attested in a Turkic stele commemorating the governor Alp Urungu of the Tuva region probably during the reign a later Uighur or Kirghiz Khan. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like the Chingiz in it is native to Turkic as it is not found in most Turkic branches &amp;amp; no where else in early Turkic (e.g. the Blue Turk steles). It is likely a Mongolic loan suggesting contact with pre-Chingizid Mongolic peoples &amp;amp; the nobility in the Uighur or the Kirghiz Khanates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was remembered by his Khitan descendants with much respect over 700 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He captured 1000 families of Japanese and made them his fishermen. Hou Han Shu&amp;rsquo;s provides an account of his attack on the Japanese:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the first year of the Kuang-ho reign period [178 A.D.]… The tribe’s [i.e. the Serbi’s] population was increasing daily, and their crops, livestock, and wild game were not enough to provide sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The koko debter was first initiated in 1206 CE &amp;amp; included a census of the subjects of the Mongol Khaghanate. At 1st, the census only included the steppe peoples. In the time of Mongke Khan it was extended to the chIna, the rUs, and Mohd subjects. In 1235 CE S.Qutuku&amp;amp; Yelü Chucai carried out a massive census of the chIna-s for the debter. One of biggest pre-modern census efforts was that of Mongke in 1252 CE spanning much of their empire. It covered chIna, rUs, Iran and the Caucasus in addition to the core steppe lands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Geser Khan epic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Geser Khan epic is one of the most remarkable texts where we can make out the layers of heathen religions piling one on top of the other. When the Mongolian version was finally published by the Manchus in 1716 CE it was part of their trilingual national formula with Manchu, Mongolian and Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The epic itself has roots in Tibet. The name of the protagonists Geser is believed by some to faint memory of Augustus or Julius but that is about it for any Roman memory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1845557829110845696&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;xiongnu&#34;&gt;Xiongnu&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What were the ethnicities included in the Huns?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has been much discussion about the ethnicity of the Huns and the Xiongnu and whether they are related at all. Otto Maenchen-Helfen, the great scholar of Hun studies, in my opinion, made a mistake by rejecting the Xiongnu-hUNa equation. The early chIna translators of Sanskrit texts clearly use the term Xiongnu for hUNa. They do not conflate it with several other ethnonyms of “barbarians” at their disposal. If they do not understand a Sanskrit ethnonym, they replace it with a calque or a phonetic rendering.+++(5)+++ This point was combined in the early 2000s by de la Vaissiere with several others to strongly revive the view that hUNa == Xiongnu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They once had powerful Khagnates that on a smaller scale reenacted the Chingizid heydays under Esen Taiji who reunified the Mongols in 1449 CE and took the Chinese emperor prisoner. The Kalmyks are a remnant of the western branch of this old Khaghanate. Later, the Oirat Dzungar Khaghanate in their heartland was subject to a genocide by the Manchus and wiped out. A few of their cousins however still survive in Western Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is interestingly attested in an Arabic record of calendrical terms used by various peoples. Some of the other animal year terms show clear Mongolic relationships in their form suggesting that Khitan was indeed para-Mongolic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Daur Mongolian peoples of NE Asia, who were exterminated in large numbers by the Rus are likely surviving descendants of the Khitans though they today speak a Mongolic language. Their language does show hints of a substrate that was likely the Khitan language that was gradually replaced by Mongolian.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another group of Khitan survivors again having lost the language live in South in the Yunnan region near modern Burma as a non-Han ethnic group. They are remnant of the Khitans who served as part of the Mongol conquest of China. They remained there after the end of the Yunnan Mongol kingdom that formed an alliance with Japan under the Khan vajra-varmin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many Khitans in the NE practice their ancient shamanistic religion and tomb of similar Khitan female shaman was recovered in Yunnan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Daur Khitan descendants show enrichment of a Y chromosome haplogroup that is a brother group to the expanded C-M217 clade attributed to the clan of Chingiz Khan. This again supports their para-Monogolic affinities &amp;amp; is consistent with the special sympathies Chingiz Khan showed to the Khitans.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First, he saw himself as avenging the overthrow of the Khitan empire by the Tungusid Jurchen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second, he appointed several notable Khitans to his administration like the gigantic Yelü Chucai.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third, the Khitans played a key role in the conquest &amp;amp; admin of the Mohammedan lands in the ex-Iranosphere by Ilkhan Hülegü, the grandson of Chingiz.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally, by thrashing Sultan Sanjar, they kept the East safe from Mohammedanization.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chIna-s note an interesting parallel to other (para)Mongolic peoples among the Khitan-s: The male population was armed &amp;amp; if they were given a call to mobilize at dawn, within 2 hours they are said to have assembled into an army ready for battle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 5 circuits of the Khitan state the height of their power ~1100s. Each circuit had its own capital; the Khan did not stay in any 1 capital &amp;amp; moved around in the ancestral nomadic fashion. Sometimes he wandered in disguise in cities/towns to gather public opinion first hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the Khitans &amp;amp;Mongols called their campsites in course of the wanderings as nat-pat or nand-bat from Skt nandi-pada = stop for refreshment or recreation. An example of an account of the Khitan Khaghan&amp;rsquo;s nat-pat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While their victims are unable to see in this, they ride out to enslave &amp;amp; plunder them. They are said to have force of a tumen under them led by Negüder. Hülegü had crushed his irredentist ventures. The strike on Kashmir by his horde is recorded in joNarAja&amp;rsquo;s rAjataraMgiNI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That translation of suu-dur as by charisma is by M.Biran others mostly translate as the good fortune following a chIna rendering. Perhaps she is capturing a genuine element in this rendering &amp;ndash; the Khaghan&amp;rsquo;s charisma coming from Tengri was something the Mongols actually experienced and saw it as an important element of their success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regarding Qubilai Khan in Fridman&amp;rsquo;s interview with J Weatherford: IMO, JW considerably downsizes Qubilai. He had challengers among the descendants of Chingiz Khan, his own brother Ariq Böke and the Qaidu, both of whom declared themselves as rival Khans. Nevertheless, Qubilai completing the Mongol conquest of China was an achievement of the highest order. We disagree with JW downplaying it and Qubilai.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our previous note on this remarkable campaign:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/mongolica-qubilai-khans-campaign-to-destroy-the-southern-song/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many played more than one role hence the count goes over 54. e.g., Bayan&amp;amp; Turtaqa Noyan were both ministers&amp;amp; commanders. Bolad was both a minister &amp;amp; member of the imperial guard as the bauarchi &amp;ndash; a function overlapping with the imperial chef.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was an image of mahAkAla which was made for Qubilai Khan &amp;amp; had great significance among the Mongols. Its possession designated the Mongol Khan as the supreme upholder of the dharma-chakra. As the Mongol empire fragmented, it passed from one minor Khan to another. The final descendant of Chingiz Khan to possess the idol was Ligdan Khan of the Chakhar branch of Qublaiids.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wanted the remaining Mongols to submit to him - but interested in keeping their uluses they formed an alliance with their former enemies the Jurchen. Chief among latter were the Khalkha Chingizids &amp;amp; Khorchin Khasarids. The princess of the Khorchins was the wife of Nurhachi of the Jurchen, soon to be Manchu. This entente defeated Ligdan Khan &amp;amp; he fled to Kokonor where he died. Some Mongols presented the idol &amp;amp; the Chingizid seal to Nurhachi&amp;rsquo;s half Mongol son Khung Taiji. Now in possession of that sovereignty conferring idol he was able to declare himself lord of all the Jurchen &amp;amp; Mongols. It is not known if the Maoists destroyed that idol or it has merely been lost somewhere in Manchuria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The route of Chingiz Khan&amp;rsquo;s remarkable western campaign with the strike on Samarqand as recorded by his ministers the Khitan Yelü Chucai &amp;amp; the Uighur Qaraiqachi Buyiruq. It is notable that after descending from the Irtysh, he followed a path close to that of the Khitan Khan Yelü Dashi&amp;rsquo;s strike on the Army of Islam led by the Turk Sanjar. This makes one think if Yelü Chucai was had preserved a memory of his ancestors&amp;rsquo; western campaign &amp;amp; Chingiz modeled his own after that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
