Interestingly, the Egyptian Mamluq chronicler al-Maqrizi (13-1400s) states that a copy of Chingiz Khan yAsA was available in a Bagdad library. Notably, Mamluq Sultan Baibars wanted to incorporate the yAsA as a valid law in his kingdom overriding sharia in appropriate situations

Mamluq al Makrizi seems to have had genuine knowledge of the yAsA of the Khan. He notes that it was recorded from wisdom, Mon: bilik after the destruction of the Kerait& Naiman -- quriltai of 1206 CE. Another Mamluq amir Artash is supposed to have had deep knowledge of the yAsA
