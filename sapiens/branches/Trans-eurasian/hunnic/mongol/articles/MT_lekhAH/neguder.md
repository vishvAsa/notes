The Venetian Marco Polo gives a curious account of the Neg端deri horde. He says they were born of Indian mothers & Mongol fathers. They are said to possess capability for a "black magic": they cause a darkness that lasts 7 days. While their victims are unable to see in this, they ride out to enslave & plunder them. They are said to have force of a tumen under them led by Neg端der. H端leg端 had crushed his irredentist ventures. The strike on Kashmir by his horde is recorded in joNarAja's rAjataraMgiNI.
