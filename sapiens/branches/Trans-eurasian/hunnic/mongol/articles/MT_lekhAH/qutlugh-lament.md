Mongol general Qutlugh lamenting the conversion of his coethnics to Mohd'ism in the 1300s:

> What have we done, that we have set aside the yasa and yosun of Chingiz Khan and taken up the religion founded in past by the Arabs that is divided into seventy-odd sects? And the choice of any these schools is a disgrace and an infamy, in that one of them allows marriage to one’s daughter, and the other to one’s mother and sister-in-law, God forbid either! We ought to return to the yasa and yosun of Chingiz Khan.
