The Ancient Indian Imprints in Siberia

Approximately 4000 kilometers to the northeast of India lies Lake Baikal. Lake Baikal is the world's largest freshwater lake by volume, containing 22–23% of the world's fresh surface water. And around Baikal in the Republic of Buryatia lives the Buryat community. This community has centuries-old ties to Indian ethos through Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, and other linkages.

Dr. Lokesh Chandra, in his article - Indian Culture in Transbaikalian Siberia, published in 1970, gives us a great glimpse into these ties. This thread is based on his writing and some other sources.

## Baikal and Vadvanala

The name of Baikal is split up as bai "existing, being, having' + Kal "fire.' In this context, Lokesh Chandra draws a parallel to the Sanskrit concept of "vadavanala," which means submarine fire.

## Indra and Agni in Shaman Songs

Dr. Chandra further writes that the pre-Buddhist cult of the Siberian Buryats was Shamanism, where elements of nature and topographic edifications were freely fused with Shaman songs extolling Indra, Agni, and other Indian deities. These fascinating songs were prevalent till the early 20th century.

Now they are known from Prof. Zamcarano's collections from the same era.

## Tibetan Buddhism
In the 18th century, around 1720, Tibetan Buddhism began to spread in the region. They built monasteries and took the teachings of Gautam Buddha to the people of Buratiya. By the 19th century, Tibetan Buddhism became the predominant religion in the region.

## Influences on the Local Deities

These influences can be seen in the localization of the Indian deities. We can see its extent in the article written by Daniel Berounsky - "Tibetan ritual texts concerning the local deities of the Buryat Aga Autonomous Region, Part II."

It goes as follows - Indra (dbang po), Yama (gshin rje), Varuṇa (chu bdag), Yakṣa (gnod sbyin), Agnideva (me lha), Rakṣasa (srin po), Vāyudeva (rlung lha), Bhūta (‘byung po), Brahma (tshangs pa) and Vanadevῑ (sa‘i lha mo). 

Even today, one of the most popular deities and temples in the area is the Tibetan version of Saraswati.

## Ramayana

The Ramayana is also known from Siberian folklore. The Research Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. has the manuscripts of Prof. Golstunsky's work on a short version of the Ramayana in the Kalmuk language.

## Gangin-os or Holy Water of Gahga in Siberia

Dr. Lokesh Chandra also recounts a personal experience in his article and the story behind it: "The Siberian Buryats revere the Holy Water of Gangä. Before receiving the Holy Water, the Patriarch recited Sanskrit mantras ... and visibly moved. The Patriarch went on reciting Sanskrit mantras while Gangä-jala was being poured from the Indian to the Buryat vessel. If it is (Ganga Jala) not available, then the water of Baikal is converted into Gangä Water by special sadhanas."

## Ayurveda in Siberia

There is a rich tradition of Äyurveda in Siberia. The libraries have preserved an enormous literature on the subject, including personal memos on prescriptions in handwritten form.

## The Vagindra 

Agvan Dorzhiev, or Agvaandorj, a Khory Buryat, developed the script in 1905 with the assistance of Tseveen Jamsrano[1] as a means of cultural unification of the Buryats, naming it "Vagindra" for the Sanskrit version of his name.

We wish to end this thread with a verbatim quote from Dr. Lokesh Chandra's article, which speaks of India's place in the minds of the Buryat community.

> "Freezing Siberia is a land where monasteries had the academic traditions of Nalanda, where Sanskrit names are still prevalent, where the Holy Water of Gangà is deeply revered, where mantras ring forth in the immensities of space and silence, where you may witness ... 
> 
> the madhuparka offered with wooden spoons in the true tradition of the Sruti, where pürnimã and amavasyà are holy days with 'white food,' where Mahakala pervades the primaeval vastnesses, where stotras to Goddess Tärä are hummed amidst the clanging and sonorous instruments. 
> 
> ... where Panini is the model for their linguistic development, where Meghaduta is their first lyric, where Äyurveda is revealed in the fullness of its tradition, where an entire literature inspired by India is preserved, 
> 
> ... where blessings are given on the triple plans of käya, vak and citta, where the saffron is the colour of sanctity, where mantras are still written in the ornamental Indic script termed Rañjanä, where pure gold illumines large scroll paintings, 
> 
> ... where people wonder at the size of India's lotuses on which their Gods and Goddesses sit or stand, and so on.  
> 
> To Transbaikalian Siberia, India is the embodied Divine, the cittam, prakriti-prabhasvaram"
