The lama tAranAtha gives a curious tale regarding the bauddhAchArya asa~Nga from puruShapura. He says that during his time, there was a settlement of a force of Qarluq Turks (!!) near the "non-bauddha" city of ayodhyA. The Qarluqs are said to have attacked him and his disciples when he was giving a sermon. He asked them to remain in meditation, and the Qarluq arrows are said to have "turned to dust". When they struck asa~Nga with a sword it broke into a hundred pieces. Seeing them immune and unmoved the Qarluqs "bowed down in great reverence and went away."

The curious point is that most historians agree that asa~Nga flourished around 400 CE. That is too early for the Turkic Khaghanate, let alone the independent Qarluq confederation within it. Hence, either tAranAtha was projecting a much later event to the time of asa~Nga, or he simply meant some other group. 

Tibetan translators have sometimes rendered the Sanskrit turuShka as Qarluq, as they were one of the most familiar Turks. However, asa~Nga was before there were any turuShka-s on the Indian horizon, let alone having a colony in ayodhyA. 

Hence, one possibility is that he was talking of a Hunnic colony and conflated them with the turuShka-s. But a Hunnic colony in ayodhyA at the zenith of gupta power seems unusual, if true. Were there Hun mercenaries in India even before their invasions?
