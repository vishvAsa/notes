Interestingly, the Khitan Khan Yelü Dashi (1124–1143) wrote to the Uighur ruler Bilge mentioning how his ancestor Abaoji, the founder of the Khitan empire, on conquering Mongolia had taken the sites of the Turkic royal steles & offered to the Uighurs to return to those lands. The Uighurs had been driven out of those lands in the great war they fought with the Kirghiz in 840 CE. Yenisei (Uibat VI) funerary inscription commemorates a certain Turkic hero named Tirig-beg who is said to have fought like a wild boar when the mighty Uighurs were overthrown.
