The Timurids under Miran Shah, son of Amir Timur defeated the Qara Qoyunlu Turkoman in Iraq, conquering Baghdad. Around ~300 years later, the Timurids and Qara Qoyunlu locked horns again, this time in Golkonda in southern India, with the same outcome. The Qutbshahis of Golkonda weren't the only Qara Qoyunlus who held power in India; Bairam Khan, the famed regent of Akbar was from Baharlu clan of the Qara confederation. Safdar Jang, the nawab of Awadh claimed to be a descendant of Qara Yusuf. 

And, it seems their traditional rivals, the Aq Qoyunlu didn't survive like the Qaras did (whose downfall the Aqs had brought in tandem with Timurids), for Shah Isma'il, though born to an Aq princess, daughter of Uzun Hasan, had no qualms ripping the pregnant bellies of Aq women.

The Turkomans ethnonyms are filled with "color": Qara-Qoyunlu= black sheeps; Aq Q.= white sheep; Qizilbash= red heads. Goes back even earlier the Kök Turk = Blue Turks; Yellow Uighurs etc.
