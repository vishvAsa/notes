      <description>&lt;p&gt;historians have explained the conversion of Inner Asian nomads as closely related to the process of state formation. When advanced tribal unions were in the process of transforming themselves into a polity, a new religion could function as a unifying force, a means of ideological distancing, and a sign of independence, all of which aided the process of state formation. 12&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case of conversion to Islam, DeWeese and Khazanov have stressed the role of the new religion in giving the Islamized group a more cohesive communal identity, differentiating between us, Muslims, and them, infidels. This new identity was often consolidated by means of war (jihād) against a common non-Muslim enemy, often a former rival faction.13&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Around ~300 years later, the Timurids and Qara Qoyunlu locked horns again, this time in Golkonda in southern India, with the same outcome. The Qutbshahis of Golkonda weren&amp;rsquo;t the only Qara Qoyunlus who held power in India; Bairam Khan, the famed regent of Akbar was from Baharlu clan of the Qara confederation. Safdar Jang, the nawab of Awadh claimed to be a descendant of Qara Yusuf.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1626377659252113409.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thread by @Peter_Nimitz on Thread Reader App – Thread Reader App&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thread with excerpts from &amp;ldquo;Nation, Language, Islam: Tatarstan&amp;rsquo;s Sovereignty Movement&amp;rdquo; by Helen M. Faller&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Volga Tatars claim descent from Khanate of Kazan &amp;amp; medieval Volga Bulgaria. Author believes that makes Volga Tatars indigenous to the region (I am skeptical, &amp;amp; strongly suspect that Chuvash are actually the heirs of Volga Bulgaria).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;USSR was comprised of 15 union republics, some which had autonomous republics under them. Tatarstan was an autonomous republic, but not a union republic under the USSR, though some Tatars tried to elevate its status. In 1991 all the union republics became independent states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They were not codified, and separated nomads from sedentary peoples. Timur’s preference for those customs over sharia led him to be considered an infidel by some Islamic thinkers. Sharia didn’t become superior to Turko-Mongol customary law in Timurid realms until 1411. Civilizing process was slow, &amp;amp; Islamic education wasn’t expanded until mid-15th century due to threat of Hurufi heresy. Some syncretism was allowed - horsemeat &amp;amp; kumis were deemed halal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
