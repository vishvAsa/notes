Ancient non-African races, as per Suemer et al.'s recent work:

There appears to have been a deep split between non-Africans who entered early Europe, represented by Czech and German fossils, and the rest of the non-African humans. Hence, any Eurasian fossils predating this period, like the Chinese big-heads, must be seen as archaic Homo or an earlier extinct wave of sapiens from Africa that left no strong extant imprint. Several other Chinese fossils, like the Dali skull from Shaanxi, the Daoxian teeth from the  Fuyan Cave and the Hualongdong cave fossils, can now be said to be archaic Homo or earlier extinct waves of sapiens from Africa. The same applies to the Tam Pa Ling cave fossils from Laos. 

One impediment in our understanding in this regard is the fossil equivalence of the Denisovans and how much morphological diversity they actually had.

This leaves open questions like the affinity of the early Australian Mungo Man, generally believed to be 40-42KY these days. Was the Mungo Man an early Tianyuan-like Eastern branch or the remnant of an extinct earlier wave of Homo that reached Australia from Africa?
