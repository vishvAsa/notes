It suggests that both dropping fertility & rise of navyonmAda are symptoms of the same problem of elite competition. However, IMO it neglects the important social contagion issue of navyonmAda -- paralleling other ekarAkShasa diseases

The authors posit 2 systems of elite certification which they call "Prussian" -- rote learning & hard exams vs "Confucian"-- more subjective display of knowledge. They believe that navyonmAda has its roots the latter where it serves as means to beating the objective "Prussian" model which has been "gamed" by the elite wannabes.+++(4)+++ Indeed, the prAchya-s & to lesser degree the deshI-s have been at the forefront of gaming it to get into elite mlechCha institutions by cracking gate-keeping tests. When they do away with these tests, like demonitization it instantly nullifies the capital of the "Asians" to enter such institutions. 

But we don't think navyonmAda originated solely for this purpose. It has been coopted by a subset of the elite to keep out "objective" competitors but its spread in 1/2 of the mlechCha elite & their deshI apers is more like the spread of its older West Asian cousins. A religion that spreads through active adoption followed the ever-renewing mechanism of enforcement by suppressing the less observant.+++(4)+++ One should not underestimate the moral foundation it provides for this part of the mlechCha elite that has lost overt ekarAkShasonmAda.+++(4)+++ 

Also while people like to call things conspiracies, we should not forget the big role of sora-bejhAdi-duShTa as evangelists for the new creed. Without the aggressive evangelism & financing its contra-biological foundations would have hardly held up. Let us not forget they played a central role in overthrowing the nAri~NgapuruSha who had suppressed it & brought in piNDaka who has been spreading it all around like wild fire.
