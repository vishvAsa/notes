## Cave art
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/2014864069941928122)

Pretty old new cave art in the Indonesian far east from Liang Metanduno on Muna Island in southeastern Sulawesi. They date this to a minimum age of 67.8±3.8thousand years BP. This is well before the ~47-50 KYA emergence of modern H.sapiens out of Africa. Hence, could it be the Denisovans or late-surviving Indonesian erectus-like forms or an earlier extinct wave of sapiens?

The authors favor it being an extinct wave of sapiens. They also note it is close to the ~65 KYA  Madjedbebe evidence from northern Australia, which has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of an early pre-modern wave of sapiens that subsequently became extinct for unknown reasons.

It is also notable that if indeed the Madjedbebe date is correct, then these early Homo did not completely exterminate the Australian megafauna. The giant wombat Diprotodon lasted for over 20K years after this date. This suggests that it was the second wave of Homo -- definitively Homo sapiens -- who destroyed the megafauna.

We favor these being a non-sapiens branch of Homo, probably Denisovans. This would imply that art spread between different branches of Homo at a fairly late age because this art appears more sophisticated than the primitive suspected art of Homo naledi.
