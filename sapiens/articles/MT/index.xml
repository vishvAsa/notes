      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/12/24/man-the-troglodyte-and-environment/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-chimpanzee&#34;&gt;Third chimpanzee&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jared Diamond, a socialist American scientist wrote a book termed the “Third chimpanzee”. Here he highlighted the similarities between us and our cousins of the genus Pan, and the explosive spread of Homo in the recent past. There have been some recent works that allow us to exquisitely understand the transition from the ancestral condition, still recapitulated in many ways by the troglodytes and the gorillas to the derived condition seen in Homo. Homo is in many ways different from the other related apes. He is naked, his canines are reduced, he walks erect all the time in adulthood, having shed the undignified ambulation on the knuckles. The females of his species sexually signal to him with their inflated mammary glands and posteriors and he tends to observe reasonably long term pair formation with his mates. His big toe in unopposed, he is clumsy on trees compared to his cousins and much to his great pride he sports an enormous brain, that is unrivalled in the animal world. These changes appear to be quite a handful for a lineage that has been relatively conservative in its ways since the days Victoriapithecus that may be close to the ancestory of both the monkeys and apes, and the early apes such as Afropithecus, Heliopithecus and Otavipithecus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The biggest impact that has been uncovered to date appears to be that of Chingiz Kha’Khan, the founder of the great Mongol nation, who appears to have left behind 16 million male descendents in the modern world. More modestly the founder of the Manchu empire, the descendents of Chingiz Khan’s arch rivals the Jurchen, appears to have left behind 1.6 million descendents today. More recently it was noted that the legendary early Irish king, Uí Néill appears to have fathered a whole bunch of Irishmen such the McDonalds, McAlisters and McDougalls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elite competition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tressel.xyz/threads/1496304792578273284&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Article via @Rjrasva :https://t.co/HWd3vi2ew6&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It suggests that both dropping fertility &amp;amp; rise of navyonmAda are symptoms of the same problem of elite competition. However, IMO it neglects the important social contagion issue of navyonmAda &amp;ndash; paralleling other ekarAkShasa diseases&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The authors posit 2 systems of elite certification which they call &amp;ldquo;Prussian&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; rote learning &amp;amp; hard exams vs &amp;ldquo;Confucian&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash; more subjective display of knowledge. They believe that navyonmAda has its roots the latter where it serves as means to beating the objective &amp;ldquo;Prussian&amp;rdquo; model which has been &amp;ldquo;gamed&amp;rdquo; by the elite wannabes.+++(4)+++ Indeed, the prAchya-s &amp;amp; to lesser degree the deshI-s have been at the forefront of gaming it to get into elite mlechCha institutions by cracking gate-keeping tests. When they do away with these tests, like demonitization it instantly nullifies the capital of the &amp;ldquo;Asians&amp;rdquo; to enter such institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Homo precursors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1902237910952251693&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The development of a Hidden Markov model for population splits and rejoinings suggests that all modern sapiens are a 80:20% composite between two ancient Homo lineages that split from each other around 1.5 Mya! One of the lineages the (80% one) also gave rise to the Neanderthal-Denisovan lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the 20% lineage was probably erectus, which split at some point from the heidelbergensis lineage, which could be the 80% one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inter specific competition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/05/07/the-upper-story-in-a-few-pictures/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that it was almost as if the brain and testis of sapiens were protected against the genetic influence of Neanderthals. Not surprisingly, the Neanderthal variants contribute to depression &amp;amp; addiction in sapiens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had argued that the explosive parallel increases in brain size in the late lineages Homo was driven by interspecies conflict. They likely created lineage-specific genetic backgrounds wherein brain expressed alleles from other others would malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
