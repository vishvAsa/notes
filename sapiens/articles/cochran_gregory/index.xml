      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/your-countrys-not-your-blood/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your country’s not your blood&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to disagree with Henry: I don’t think there’s been selection for&#xA;ethnic nepotism. I somewhat suspect that there may have been recent&#xA;selection for more accurate altruism, in some populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that in much of history, people lived in small groups that often&#xA;fought with their neighbors. In that sort of situation, selection for&#xA;group altruism is at least possible, since the group is full of close&#xA;relatives, while the opponents are less closely related. Both sides&#xA;are probably members of the same broad ethnic group or race, but that&#xA;doesn’t matter : only the kinship coefficients matter.+++(4)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Biology of Slavery</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/the-biology-of-slavery/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Biology of Slavery&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why did slavery pay? In what circumstances? In a Malthusian world, a&#xA;laborer’s pay is just enough to allow him to raise two kids to&#xA;adulthood. That’s all the average peasant makes, so that’s all an&#xA;employer has to pay. Someone who raised slaves for labor would have to&#xA;spend just as much or go out of business, in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in the Classical world, slaves mainly made economic sense (for the&#xA;masters, natch) only if you could steal them, generally through wars of&#xA;conquest. If Rome enslaved a 20-year Thracian farmer, they could get&#xA;decades of work out of him without having to pay for his upbringing.+++(5)+++ All&#xA;of this assumes that the Romans had special expertise in conquest and&#xA;social control, and for the most part they did. Of course, if they&#xA;picked the wrong Thracian, they could be sorry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Giving Bigotry a Chance</title>

Hamilton’s description of kin selection and inclusive fitness in&#xA;1964 led to a major remake of ethology and behavioral biology. He&#xA;pointed out, for example that since full sibs share half their genomes,&#xA;anything one does for the other also propagates his own genome,&#xA;discounted by one half in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general the discount is given by the coefficient of relationship&#xA;between the actors: one half between full sibs or between parent and&#xA;offspring, one quarter between actor and grandchild, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
