## Vikrama Pandya
As usual, hypocrisy and tangential statements are only used by Krishnan here. It has become his practice to deny actual facts and uphold fantasies as history. Let us look at his claims here: 

he thinks that Nilakantha Sastri is the only source for Vikrama defeating Kafur.  
He even claims that Lilatilakam, a 14th century text, is based on Sastri!!! Talk about baseless claims!! -2

That Vikrama Pandya, brother of Kulasekhara, was involved in defeating Kafur's invasion is proven by proper reading of multiple sources. 

1. Vikrama Pandya was a brother of Emperor Kulasekhara 
2. Lilatilakam mentions that this Vikrama Pandya was defeated by Sangramadheera - 3
3. Sangramadheera married daughter of Vikrama Pandya 
4. Lilatilakam also mentions that Vikrama Pandya defeated Turushkas 
5. Wassaf states that Kafur had to retreat because Pandyas gathered a large force to oppose him - thus, we get indirect corroboration from Islamic side -4

Who was this Vikrama Pandya? He is the Vikrama Pandya who is mentioned as ruling during the 1280s by Sethuraman. That matches with Lilatilakam which says that Sangramadheera defeated him when the latter was young - 5

Vikrama Pandya, the father in law of Sangramadheera, seems to have defeated Kafur. He had no reason to oppose his own son in law's army after this event. That he didn't participate in later wars does not take away the contemporary evidence given by Lilatilakam & Wassaf - 6

Krishnan could have simply kept to the questions asked of him. But no, he took up Vikrama Pandya merely to shift goalpost. A very shameful behavior. I didnt want to involve with his fanciful posts. But he has made it a practice of denying factual history, forcing my hand. 

## Ranga Krishna muthu veerappa Naicker
Let us look at his current post on Ranga Krishna muthu veerappa Naicker. This ruler died in 1689. His only source for the fable is a book by Taylor which is translation of some local work. There are many problems in this fable. Let us see them one by one - 8

1. The fable quoted by him doesn't give name of Muslim ruler. It is assumed to be Aurang. But Aurang could not send any forces to Trichy or Madurai before 1689 since northern TN was under rule of Marathas under Shambhaji. No evidence exists for Mughal incursion here back then -9
2. The fable is from a text which gives even the years wrongly (RKMV Nayak ruled from 1682-89 but it wrongly claims that his rule started from 1698). Thus, the authenticity of its claims & fables are dubious since it cannot even give the reigning period properly for the ruler- 10
3. Mughal records are available in huge volumes. There is no evidence in Mughal durbar records for a large army being sent with the shoe of the emperor along with 2 Nawabs as claimed in this fable. No other Hindu or Muslim contemporary record talks about such practice either. -11
4. So, essentially Krishnan has quoted a fable from a dubious record which was translated by an Englishman in the 19th century and considers it as great evidence for Nayak defeating Aurang. He declined to accept contemporary durbar records of Shivaji earlier. What a hypocrisy!-12

### Rani Mangammal
Cherry on top was his reply to someone else where he has called Rani Mangammal as wife of RKMV Nayak. Whereas she was the mother of this Nayak. A mother has been converted into a wife, most probably an inadvertent error. But he avoids that topic which shows his dishonesty -13
