Certain historical events cannot be spoken about in their totality in the Occident. One such is the complex of WW1-interwar-WW2. At the end of these events many groups, the Russians, Germans, Jews, Poles, Japanese, suffered huge losses. However, each of their own stories of these events are often in deep conflict with those of the others and narrative of the Anglospheric victor. It is too interwoven into the mythology of the neo-Anglosphere, like the kurukShetra war for the H. This makes it imperative for H to study this history unbiased by the dominant Occidental narrative.

Should the death of 2-3 million vA~Nga-s due to British policy during WW2 be considered in the toll of the war? It is something which rarely gets mentioned in Anglospheric tellings of the events. And if mentioned there is always an attempt to exonerate themselves.
