## Radiometry
### Radiocarbon
C14 is continuously generated (UV rays in upper atmosphere +++(hitting what??)+++), and destroyed.  
When organic matter dies; C14 absorption stops (no creation). By measuring the fraction of C14 atoms, can figure out age of death.

Works on organic materials up to about 60,000 years of age. material is destroyed during the test. samples are also easily contaminated - so need to clean meticulously.
