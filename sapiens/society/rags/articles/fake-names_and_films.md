Jai Bhim is a propoganda movie based on real events & all real names have been retained in the film; except that of the main villain. The villain whose real name is "Anthony Sami" has been changed to "Gurumoorthy" on screen; thus making him a Hindu Vanniyar and making the movieall about caste discrimination. In real life, it was a Christian sub-inspector who framed the victims and tortured them. But in the movie, his name, religion and caste have been changed to falsely portray it as atrocities committed by upper caste Hindus on lower caste.+++(5)+++ Not just that,derogatory language is also used against Brahmins to insinuate that they r a vile untrustworthy community. 

The film fraternity always has an evil habit of making movies on real events,but twisting a few facts to forward their vile agenda and spread hatred against Hindus. Few years back, a movie was made on Badaun rape & murder case named "Article 15", where the culprits were shown as Brahmins and victims as Dalits. But in real life, both the accused and victims belonged to OBC caste.+++(5)+++ The movie also justified naxalism and militancy as aside-effect of atrocities committed on Dalits.

A few more examples:

- Chak De India showed SRK's character Kabir Khan as MusIim in order to portray fake narrative of Islamophobia in Indian society. However the movie is inspired by life of former Indian hockey team goalkeeper Mir Ranjan Negi, a Hindu.
- Sherni which flipped the religions of positive and negative characters. Real life hunter Asghar Ali Khan portrayed as Kalawa-wearing "Pintu Bhaiya" while real life forest officer KM Abharna is portrayedas "Vidya Vincent". Also fictional MusIim character of Hassan Noorani (Vijay Raaz) introduced as kind-hearted & conscientious environmentalist, who helps to save tigers.
- Bajirao Mastani where Peshwa family shown as religious bigots, who torture Mastani as she is MusIim & Bajirao's brother portrayed as a greedy & useless opportunist who tries to kill her and her son. In reality, Mastani was neither tortured nor ostracized. Bajirao's brother Chimaji was an excellent military commander and successful war strategist.

The list of such movies,serials & web series is endless. Indian movie makers hav always been using subtle propaganda in their films to drive their own narrative-showing MusIims as noble & faithful, Hindus as caste-obsessed, Hindu priests or godmen as greedy, lustful, charlatans & so on. In the past, people used to hardly notice this subtle propaganda and brainwashing. 

Remember Amitabh Bacchan who would regularly portray atheist Hindu characters, constantly haranguing & accusing Hindu Gods in temples; while at the time wearing 786 badges & having noble Namaazi MusIims as sidekicks (Sher Khan anyone?). 

Remember Karan-Arjun type movies where evil Thakurs worship Goddess Kali before tormenting poor villagers? Raising awareness in recent times is exposing the Hinduphobia & calling it out.

Boycott such movies. Protest against it. There should be strict punishment or defamation case that needs to lodged on these film fellows if they are making a real life stories as movies in twisted manner, as movies are medium that reach a larger audience than books & also taken as evidence by dumb head Indians!
