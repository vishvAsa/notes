In Tamil movies, perversion around Brahmin women is an old phenomenon. It doesn't matter if people born into the community are involved.

- K Balachander movie Arangetram - orthodox Shastri's daughter becomes a prostitute due to poverty
- KB again in Apoorva Ragangal - older divorced Brahmin woman starts an affair with much younger man, while her daughter runs away and has an affair with the father
- Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal - Brahmin college girl is raped. She leaves the house, finds her rapist and becomes friends with him.
- Sirai - orthodox Shastri's wife is raped by a Christian thug. The Shastri is unable to take it and leaves her. She moves in with her rapist and eventually has a platonic relationship. The rapist is again shown in a positive light towards the end.
- Idu Namma Aalu - barbers son pretends to be a Brahmin and moves into a Brahmins house. Falls in love, marries the daughter. He finally gives a lecture to the Brahmin father on being inclusive and open minded 
- Setu - stalks and kidnaps a Brahmin girl. She is supposed to fall for the protagonist upon his promise of sex and his disgust for her orthodox tuft-bearing fiancee. 

The trajectory is prostitution due to poverty --> rape as a tool of conquest --> cheating and impersonation --> stalking and kidnap.

The new movies (eg. Bad Girl 2025) are a culmination of the fantasy where the Brahmin woman offers herself - the sermons about patriarchy and emancipation are just a pretext, the weakling's tool of rape.
