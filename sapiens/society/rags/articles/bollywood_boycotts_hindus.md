Conversations with a Creative - How Bollywood boycotts Hindus

A friend in his mid 50s used to be a screenwriter in Bollywood. He was doing very well in terms of the number of movies and ads he was getting. But when he started exposing the Left he was cancelled by Bollywood. The number of jobs he got turned into a trickle. “Producers and directors stopped calling me. I was getting assignments only when there was nobody willing to undertake the script for a particular movie.” Since he was financially sound he managed to absorb the losses. “I was at that stage of my life when there were no large liabilities or responsibilities so I managed without a large income.”

However, younger people who did not toe the secular line felt the blow. One of them is a singer and voiceover artist in his 20s. When his social media posts reflected pro-Narendra Modi views, his job offers disappeared. This younger artist used to get around 4 ads a month. But with his openly pro-Hindu views, he is lucky to get 2 every four months. That’s simply not enough to lead a comfortable life. 

With Bollywood boycotting Hindus, my friend had two options - Telugu movies or Gujarat. “The Telugu film industry doesn’t practise the policy of apartheid against Hindus and they pay very well. However, his Telugu is just passable and it would have required some time and effort to become familiarised with the language. So he moved to Gujarat. "The movie scene in Gujarat is on an upward curve and there is plenty of space for newcomers and outsiders," he says. He is now based in Gujarat and has enough work to lead a comfortable lifestyle, although the money is nowhere in the same league as Bollywood.

So how does the Bollywood apartheid system work? Firstly, the family-based system that is run by a handful of seculars such as Dharma Productions, Yashraj Films, Kapoors, Bhatts, Farhan Akhtar and Balaji control the mainstream movies. These people are completely anti-Hindu and even anti-India. Some of them are pro-Pakistan and pro-Muslim. As KRK tweeted recently, "The only aim of Lal Singh Chaddha is to make Pakistan look good." 

## OTT
OTT platforms such as Netflix, Disney+Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video are equally Hinduphobic. 

Aparna Purohit of Amazon Prime was a toxic leftist who regularly shared and propagated hate against Hindus, India, Modi and CAA while heading a major OTT company’s India operations. Purohit commissioned some of the most anti-Hindu web series such as Tandav. Tandav mocks Lord Shiva and shows him as a devilish joker jealous of Lord Ram’s popularity and utters expletives in English. In Tandav, there are shouts of “Azadi from Brahmanvad” and anti-Dalit dialogues being mouthed by upper caste Hindus, aimed at inciting riots. Hindu cops are shown raping Muslim women and killing Muslims. “Purohit’s Hinduphobic ideology can be gauged from an analysis of her social media posts which display her jaundiced and highly prejudiced views against Hinduism, Hindu policemen, Hindu ascetics, the BJP and RSS, and provokes class wars," says Gayatri N of Bharat Voice. “She abuses the professional platform of Amazon Prime to promote her toxic ideology of ultra-leftist and jihadi bias against Hinduism and Hindus in general,” adds @Vaikhuntavasi

There was Fox Star's Rucha Pathak. She is married to a Muslim. Both she and her husband spewed hate all over social media. (See screenshots) The irony is large studios - who are banking on the large Indian market - are allowing such politicised, poisonous and clearly unhinged leftists and jehadis to spew hatred against Hindus from their OTT platforms. Studios don't allow any negative things to be shown on China because Beijing will immediately blacklist them. Something for India to chew on. Govt is quick to ban defence MNCs caught bribing Indians. So why can't it ban studios that promote Hinduphobia? Pathak was ultimately thrown out. But she was promptly rehabilitated by Bollywood in Farhan Akhtar’s Excel Entertainment.

Similarly, another Hinduphobe Srishti Behl Arya was thrown out as Director of Indian Original Films at Netflix, but joined Anurag Kashyap - a virulent Hindu hater who makes pathetic quality films. Wags joke he was born to make flops. The friend says: “The global CEOs of these OTT companies wonder as to why they are not able to crack the Indian market. Do they ever check their offerings?” Or is being woke now a standard requirement at every studio? Anupam Kher was exasperated when he said how his overseas shoots have so many restrictions on what to speak and what to avoid. 

What these OTT platforms are actually doing is they are convincing the audience that YouTube is the best bet. YouTube deals are hitting the sky nowadays. Dubbed films from the South have a strong audience on cable & satellite, plus they are getting YouTube deals now. YouTube too had a plan of commissioning originals. And it did start with a bang, with 'Cobra Kai' S1. But somehow they backed out and sold their portfolio. Guess the channel marketing guys felt that once YouTube gets its own premium channel, the other studios/channels might feel left out or biased, and pull their stuff.

Because Bollywood and its OTT siblings are cancelling Hindus, it is perfectly justified for Hindus to #BoycottBollywoodCompletely. There should be no letup in the boycotts. Meanwhile, the @UPGovt must fast forward the setting up of a true Hindi film industry.
