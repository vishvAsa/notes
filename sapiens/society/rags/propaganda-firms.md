- Shady characters on board
  - While not every single member of The Atlantic Council is a democracy toppling, war monging, misinformant kidnapper, they certainly have an agenda (mostly big business and state interests). They’re not at all objective and there’s more than enough shady characters on the board for everyone to be concerned.
- Shady funding
  - Weapons manufacturers
  - twenty-five foreign governments

### Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)
- Supposed purpose: study disinformation in open source environments and report on democratic processes.
- Funded by social media giants.
- Involved in censorship - suspension of SM accounts with contrary views.
