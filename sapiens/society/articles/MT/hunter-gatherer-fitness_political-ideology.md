> Conservatives exhibit higher levels of health, beauty, fertility, strength, size, testosterone, and spatial intelligence, while liberals excel in social skills and verbal intelligence. Higher trait intensities should correlate with more extreme political attitudes, with exceptions of course.

While we agree with several directions presented in the article,  
we do not entirely endorse its claims.  
We believe the waters have been muddied by: 

1. more complex selection trajectories in settled differentiated populations since the neolithic.  
   We believe "differentiation" and "sedentariness" imposed huge selective forces in Eurasia and parts of pre-Euro America. 
2. Further, the effects of the females as the primarily dispersing sex in Homo sapiens  
   has likely placed selective pressures on them,  
   such as easier ideological switching.+++(5)+++ 
3. Based on insect models and their extrapolation to Homo,  
   selection for increased male-fitness favorable traits  
   probably harms daughters' fitness  
   and vice-versa for female traits:  
   so there is a balancing selection from tradeoff. 
4. There also appears to be a bet-hedging strategy in group fission societies that would feed into this.  
5. In modern, occidentally induced left-liberal movements,  
   we have to seriously consider the cannon-fodder hypothesis,  
   wherein a relatively small elite mobilizes forces of lower IQ and low status masses for their own benefit  
   by fostering memetic diseases center on utopian promises
