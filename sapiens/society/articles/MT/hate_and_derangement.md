> Anyone who is obsessed with Modi loses all their sanity. Not a single exception to this in public life. There is something about Modi that once you start hating him wholeheartedly, you lose your intellectual frame and even start erring in your specialized domains.

It is interesting that this is a general phenomenon: we have derangement syndromes triggered by nAri~NgapuruSha & rUspati just like the lATarAT. I've also seen several people flip from total bhagat to dviT from one term to another. I think there're 3 distinct (but may be related) psychologies involved here: 

1. As we have mentioned before, there is a core "political orientation" everyone has. But some people especially in their teens-20s wander around a bit before reaching it because they are unable to read more complex cues. Thus, they might be le-libs but do not find that pole right from the start before some wandering to reach it (& vice versa). 
2. There are people whose identity is strongly invested in one or a few very specific issues. While a political movement might be aligned in a general sense with those issues, the leader might not care/might be slow in acting/unable to act on their specific defining issues, thus triggering anger no different from the pratipakSha. 
3. An organic, deep-seated proclivity for a contrary ideological position: proclivity for unmAda. Then you will have MDS+++(=modi derangement syndrome)+++ or TDS+++(=Trump DS)+++ off the bat when the said politician comes to power. That this is something organic and deep-rooted comes from its physiognomic expression. You can make out a navyonmatta correctly with high probability by just looking at them or seeing a snippet of their behavior.
