The ancient world, unlike many neo-occidentally conditioned folks, recognized that leadership of men was related to something special -- it could be seen as a the charisma seen only in a true leader. That's why we have approximately equivalent words: Skt: shrI; Iranic: Xvarena, Turkic: kut, Mongolic: suu, Chinese: yun, Arabic: dawlat. That it cuts across religions and ethnicities in Eurasia indicates that it is something primal. Even the Austronesia Maoris had something called mana. 

At times of stress nation can only be led by men with that special thing. Despite the neo-occidental conditioning, one can see that the pull of this special charisma exists to date in the west. It is something an oligarchy deep state greatly fears for it would transfer the mandate from their shadow government to the "ekavIra". The word ekavIra is an important expression of this character in the shruti as it is applied in the divine realm to indra, the leader of the gods and defeater of a 100 armies.

## Judge of men
One key to success in endeavors is to be a judge of men. It is not easy at all because the natural tendency is to attract psychotics, mercurial psychopaths, and sycophants. Only a few manage to set these aside & make the right choice every time. The rest get balanced out by choices.

I think a lot of the "not judging" is merely an expression of trying to accommodate the eccentricities of the concerned individual. Depending on the parties & the job involved, some quirks can go "unjudged" but others might be simply unacceptable.
