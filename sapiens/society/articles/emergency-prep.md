Some advice. Install water tanks & stock up your pantry with non-perishable foods such as milk powder, flattened rice, rolled oats, iodine salt, wheat, lentils.. get battery or solar panel radios (and tune in your radio!), extra batteries, warm clothes, gas tank, stock up your medicine cabinet with disinfectants, sewing kit, gauze & bandages, broad-spectrum antibiotics, NSAIDs, antibacterial creams, diphenhydramine, loperamide, ORS & antidiarrheals (this is important!!). 

If you are on prescription such as insulin then stock up on those stock up on soaps and toothpaste too, easiest way to avoid illness is washing yourself. stock up on diapers & period pads. Buy flashlights, map & compass. Write important telephone numbers on a notebook and teach your children to be able to tell their full name, parents full name and make your children memorise important numbers, landmarks & basic self defence. Keep your ID cards, passports & other important documents near you! Get a pair of good shoes (easiest way to avoid tetanus)!! 

How to prepare yourself for psychological warfare:

1. do not spread fake news or news that is half true but taken out of context

2. learn to detect AI generated images & videos

3. do not panic & fall for mass hysteria!!

4. share info from only trusted sources, cross check 
digital security:

1. do not open links you got on email

2. install security updates

3. backup your most important data on external harddisk, usb or cloud service

4. update your passwords with long & secure ones 

## Learn how to first aid:

1. prioritise safety
2. asses the situation, move to safe surroundings if necessary, call for help if possible
3. learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation
4. learn to tourniquet (useful to wear denim jeans with belt)
5. learn ABCDE protocol 

ABCDE protocol:

- Airways (clear them)
- Breathing (ensure respiration)
- Circulation (ensure cardiac output)
- Defibrillation (start CPR in the case of cardiac arrest)
- Disability (check neurological conditions by looking at pupils, mobility, asymmetric droopy face etc.)
- Evaluate 

## Safety measures:

Do not open suspicious mails (they could contain anthrax, sarin or other chem/bio weapons).

If you contract an infectious disease, isolate yourself!! Follow the instructions of authorities.

Keep tools of survival with you, such as a army knife, lighter etc. 

I see a few comments saying that nothing will happen. Maybe so. I don't mean to scare people. It's still good to be prepared. "Nothing will happen" was what my dadaji & dadi thought too, until something happened, then they had to run away bare feet, and their daughter perished. 

Should a situation arise where food shortages are frequent, keep in mind that there are edible weeds that can provide you with vitamins, such as poi saag (basella alba), noniya saag (purslane, portulaca oleracea), wild colocasia leaves, amaranth, sim saag (watercress)
