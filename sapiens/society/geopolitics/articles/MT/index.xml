As the intrepid marauder lay dying, emptying out his bowels while retreating from a failed assault on Panama, he marked a historical moment with decisive geopolitical consequences down to our current age. On one side, he was taking to sea the long Western European predatory tradition going back to the phiraṅga-s like +++(crusaders)+++ Raymond, Baldwin, Godfrey, and Warner and the king of his own people, the wicked Richard Yes-and-No +++(←nickname from terse speech)+++. On the other side, Drake set into motion a process that was to bloom into a maritime predatory tradition that continues to dominate the geopolitics of our times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He sent them to us to and we decide to edit them and post them as and when we get the chance — not out of a narcissistic impulse but simply to record some of these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: You keep mentioning the “addiction principle” as yet another feature shared by biological conflicts at the microscopic level and human geopolitical conflicts. Could you explain that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deterrence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1966902200723972298&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone was recently telling me that before nuclear weapons, there was no concept of a deterrent that could maintain peace. It is believed that nuclear weapons were the primary cause for the Cold War being cold rather than hot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I question the idea that there was no concept of a deterrent before that. There were deterrents before nukes. The Germans had the best gas warfare capability in terms of the agents they synthesized. The British gas weapons were nowhere in the league of the German ones. The American versions were also inferior, but in sheer quantity, they were apparently way more than those of the Germans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many parts of the world have still not entirely come to terms with it: it either created new faultlines or exacerbated old ones and continues to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;artisans&#34;&gt;Artisans&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was particularly brutal on the artisanal groups. Only these Japanese, to a degree, were able to balance this assault on their artisanal guilds. In India, it destroyed the service castes: leaders like the faux mahAtman never understood its real significance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intra-abrahamistic-synergy&#34;&gt;Intra-Abrahamistic synergy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In his theory of the clash of civilizations Samuel Huntington had predicted that the chIna-s and the marUnmatta-s will ally against the Occidental Judaeo-Christian civilization. He was not entirely right in this regard: what he missed was the extent to which intra-Abrahamistic synergy fosters marUnmAda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there might be synergy between the jihad and the chIna-s in specific limited cases, this is not a general thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather everything points in the direction of our theory: sarvonmAdasamAyoga-ekarAkShasa-jAla-shambara. The problem for the H is being at the receiving end of both axes &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unrollthread.com/t/1582574421369229314/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In interesting offshoot of the rUs-rotten soybean war is the window it offers into the arms race between the Islamic Republic on one hand &amp;amp; the Jewish intelligence + American pelf+++(=अधार्मिक-सम्पत्)+++ on the other. The latter clearly has a huge heft &amp;amp; the IR realized that it cannot have any kind of parity in terms of strategic defense measures against them. The Americans had shown how they could throw them around when they took out their key general +++(soleimani)+++. Israel&amp;rsquo;s iron dome had also shown it could work against the rockets of its Islamic rivals. This meant that the IR was essentially rendered toothless in the event of greater escalation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He felt marUnmatta-s will play both sides. Further, I&amp;rsquo;ve posited that Galtonism is a strong force and might prevent that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sarvonmatta-samayoga-ekarakshasa-jala&#34;&gt;sarvonmatta-samAyoga-ekarAkShasa-jAla&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pa~nchanetraka emasculates you, and the marUnmatta moves into your house to claim it as his: sarvonmatta-samAyoga-ekarAkShasa-jAla in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The chIna system is resistant to this type of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spengler</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/sapiens/society/geopolitics/articles/MT/spengler/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spengler did not understand Darwin&amp;rsquo;s evolutionary theory correctly, but he correctly apprehended the evolutionary dynamics of civilization as a whole. While at one level, energetics might explain aspects of it (e.g., Tainter), Spengler had his finger on something more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1423532226885607427&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oswald Spengler was a fertile thinker of the type that even if wrong in the details there is much of fertile value in the kind of thinking they initiated. That can be said of the geometric though of Plato &amp;amp; the natural history of Aristotle. Though many of our times tend&#xA;to put much faith in contra-Spenglerian thought I have not seen they have much to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
