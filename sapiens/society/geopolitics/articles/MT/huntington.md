## Intra-Abrahamistic synergy

In his theory of the clash of civilizations Samuel Huntington had predicted that the chIna-s and the marUnmatta-s will ally against the Occidental Judaeo-Christian civilization. He was not entirely right in this regard: what he missed was the extent to which intra-Abrahamistic synergy fosters marUnmAda. 

While there might be synergy between the jihad and the chIna-s in specific limited cases, this is not a general thing. 

Rather everything points in the direction of our theory: sarvonmAdasamAyoga-ekarAkShasa-jAla-shambara. The problem for the H is being at the receiving end of both axes -- 

- the chIna drive for being an Asiatic hegemon with outrageous territorial claims and 
- the svabhAvairam coming from ekarAkShasatvam
