As we have remarked at length before, Russia has always had the aspiration to be a full member of what is colloquially termed the Occident -- the currently ascendant confederation led by the Anglo-abrahamospheric core. However, its advances to them has been repeatedly spurned even as they see the rUs as an existential threat. 

We believe the Russian desire is sincere but most of the Occident sees it totally unworthy of consideration barring players like duShTa jarilaputra. For the leadership of the Occident they are just too much of a competing and ideologically divergent world view to accommodate within their tent.

Notably even among the Indians, there is a part of the core elite and aspirational middle and lower classes that similarly believes that they belong in the same tent as the Occident. They too fail to see that the occident wants nothing to do with them and have them nowhere in their midst. 

That's why I remain unexcited by the recent Euro-Indian rapport. The sands are shifting but they could easily shift the other way.
