In interesting offshoot of the rUs-rotten soybean war is the window it offers into the arms race between the Islamic Republic on one hand & the Jewish intelligence + American pelf+++(=अधार्मिक-सम्पत्)+++ on the other. The latter clearly has a huge heft & the IR realized that it cannot have any kind of parity in terms of strategic defense measures against them. The Americans had shown how they could throw them around when they took out their key general +++(soleimani)+++. Israel's iron dome had also shown it could work against the rockets of its Islamic rivals. This meant that the IR was essentially rendered toothless in the event of greater escalation. 

This seems to have been the driver behind their drone development. These relatively low cost drones with a minimal thermal signature could pose a serious challenge to the Israeli defenses short of them nuking the IR over. Thus, the IR response has been to focus on tactical advantages at a low cost to make up for the strategic imbalance. 

Probably Israel+US will keep taking out their nuclear attempts before they get to any level of strategic parity with Israel. Even that will not help because Israel is essentially = Isr + USA. 

The rUs seem to have again focused largely on trying to keep strategic parity with the pa~nchanetra + vassals & it might end up being useful the way the mahAmlechCha are escalating. However, that is of little use in the actual war with a decline demography & general weariness. 

Thus, the Islamic Republic has filled a critical gap in this regard. I wonder how much of that captured American drone was reverse-engineered by the IR; how much tech sharing is going on with the chIna-s; will this tech be shared with rUs & developed further by them? 

In any case Isr will be closely watching these developments -- in that perhaps IR has exposed its main tactical advantage & played its hand too soon by proxy. In any case, it has finally sparked the real age of the drone war that many of us were thinking was on the horizon.
