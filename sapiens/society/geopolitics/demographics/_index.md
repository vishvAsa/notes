## Birth rate vs number of babies
NUMBER of babies born is not the the birth RATE just as the AMOUNT of interest you receive on a savings account is not the the interest RATE. If the number of women in the fertile age cohort (15-45 for statiscal purposes) shrinks, there would be fewer babies born even if the rate remains the same.
