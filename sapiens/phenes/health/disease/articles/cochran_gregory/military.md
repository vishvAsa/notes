Imperial Japan and the USSR worked at harnessing the power of scientific medicine for destruction ( Unit 731, anthrax factories, tons of smallpox virus, etc). So did half-way decent countries like the US and UK. 

Why don't we ever hear about someone harnessing the power of "alternative medicine" for military purposes? 

Because it doesn't have any power.

I should point out that scientific medicine has also made a vast positive difference in the military sphere. Used to be that  most losses in war were due to infectious disease, not combat: no longer the case.

Contributions  of "alternative" medicine in this area?
