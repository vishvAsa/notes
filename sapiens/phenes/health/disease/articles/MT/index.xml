Moreover those specializing in certain prey, like bats or primates most like underwent natural selection against the pathogens acquired from those sources (i.e. natural immunity) &amp;ndash;like say bat- &amp;amp; primate- eating tribes from different parts of India &amp;ndash; circulating antibodies against bat-borne viruses for e.g.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This probably went hand-in-hand with the practice of active xenophobia that was strongly selected for as a defense against infection-laden foods &amp;amp; pathogens acquired from strangers who had immunity to them.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>
