Modern "allopathic" medicine is preferable for intensive care.

Limited efficacy of herbal medicine comes with "less harm", and focus on holistic approach encompassing diet, sleep, emotional well-being. Very scalable.

Hospitals are ok if one's wary of the pitfalls -

- eagerness to ply one's tools - including knife, and saw 
  - eg. 30-50% C section rates ()
  - Dentists are notorious that way! From adding on polishing to scaling to prematurely "fixing" the minutest cavities, not informing about the limited lifetime of cements, laxity in providing info about filling contents etc..
- fear of any possible blame
- control-mania
- knowledge advantage over patient
- fees (including hospital pressure)
