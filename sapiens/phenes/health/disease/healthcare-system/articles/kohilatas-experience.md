Some of you have recently discovered me, whilst others have known me for a few years now.  Many of you may be wondering where I had been and what I was doing, whilst others know me quite well. To get everyone on the same page, I thought it would be good to tell a little story.

## Emergency department
In late 2019 and early 2020 I was asked to work front line in an emergency department to help with the "war effort". We had no idea what was going on, apart from a few videos of the Chinese suddenly collapsing due to this new contagion.

We were waiting for it to hit the UK. It hit, I saw what it did to people, people became unwell, xray xray xray, PPE, barriers, red lights, code words, panic panic. Our world changed overnight, and my world changed especially.

One minute we were told not to wear masks, the next moment it was made mandatory etc. My sole focus was to protect myself and my family at this point, and so in efforts to do this successfully I began studying. 

I read papers during my breaks, at night, before work. I reflected on what I saw at work, and made a mental note of real life evidence. The emergency department warped as time went on, I saw a lot of errors happening and mismanagement of resources. Patient care was being delayed and this led to staff burnout and medical errors. I could see that if this went on, people would needlessly die.

I knew something had to change. So in efforts to bring about some change, I wrote a book outlining how Toyota lean manufacturing methods could aid with improving patient safety as well as reduce cost in emergency departments. The book was called Saving A&E The Toyota Way. I learnt a lot a about healthcare infrastructure, AI, and preventative medicine whilst researching for it. I knew what the national health situation was like, I knew we had to change as a species.

I presented that book to my hospital, my consultants liked it, but as an acedemic piece. That was not my intention, but hey ho, life goes on. There were more pressing matters at hand. As the pandemic was progressing, I continued to research, write blogs and shared what I saw. And I saw a lot of unscientific rubbish, unethical practices and poor care. The reaearch papers said one thing, and yet we were doing something completely different.

I knew from very early on that not everyone needed to be jabbed, something seemed fishy. I worked in the emergency department, and then paediatrics during the second peak. There was one child admitted due to C19 and later discharged. The ward was largerly empty. And yet many doctors online were saying that C19 was extremely dangerous to children. Nonsense.

Something was off, doctors weren't being doctors, autopsies weren't being done, the medical field were ignoring anyone who didn't have C19, and yet staff were doing tiktok dances. They asked me to join. I refused. 

Whilst all this was happening, I lost my grandma. The docs didn't want to see her in her home, her infection got bad, she didn't want to go to hospital, she became septic, she had to go in. I visited her after my shifts and fed her during my breaks.

On the night she died, I got a call from a doc with the bad news. I asked the doc if we could see her as a family, they approved. We saw her one after the other, in tears, trying to be quiet as to not wake the other patients up. Midway through, a matron I used to work with told us we couldn't see her due to hospital policy and warned us that if we carried on that she would call security on us. I told her we had approval already. She didn't care. I saw evil in her eyes. I asked her why she became a nurse. It was surely to treat and help people with compassion. She didn't budge. I said "go ahead and call security then". Thank God, we had enough time for our family to all say our goodbyes. I made sure I was the last one.

I knew and saw that many others weren't as lucky as I was. Many had to facetime their dying family members. We were treated so badly. And healthcare professional encouraged it. I also knew the evils that lurked inside mankind that day.

During paediatrics I asked my colleagues about masks and jabs. Why did we only allow one parent to see their newly born child whilst wearing a mask, but we could all snuggle up together in the staff room maskless, for example?

I would get back parroted like responses."It's the rules". Policy". "To stop infection". "We just have to do it". No science. No debate. No convo. No brain. I later worked in a childrens psychiatric ward, and what I witnessed was truly backward.

Many children, many who wanted to commit suicide, were placed in solitary confinement, so useless PCR swabs could be taken. Two would be need to be done and the nurses would sometimes forget to do these. I actually had to make them a table, so they would remember. Children had to be swabbed but staff members who'd go God knows where during the weekend didnt. I told my seniors that none of this made sense and children did not suffer with C19, but they just told me it was policy.

The hospital trust actually recruited people to make sure staff were changing into scrubs before work too. The worst of it was when we had a wardround one time. In psychiatry the patient would sit in the room with the rest of the staff.

This particular time, my consultant found out that the young person that was in the room with us wasn't swabbed. After the patient had left, she made us all stay in the room and asked us to lock the door and find ways to disinfect the room. She was seriously considering bleaching all surfaces. In disbelief, I asked her if we had to all strip down naked and shower together too. I had work to do, so I left.

The mental health of children and adults during lockdown was the lowest I've ever seen it in my career. Children were arriving with life disruption related issues, trauma, abuse etc. All related to lockdowns. 

### GMC failure
One thing I failed to mention was the day I lost complete trust in the GMC, the UK medical regulatory body, supposedly in charge of protecting patients from doctors.

I remember when plans on introducing the jabs to children nationally was considered. I was mortified. I knew through real life and via scientific evidence that children did not need these jabs whatsoever.

So in desperation I wrote an open letter to the GMC, highlighting all the evidence, basically pleading with them to reconsider the roll out. I was putting my career at risk by doing this. I knew I would become a target. But I didn't care. We were talking about childrens lives. I made it an open letter and placed it on a petition site. It gained traction fast.

The site took the letter down, claiming it was "misinformation". I later learnt that the site was owned by the Gates. This was the letter: Protect our children. — Dr. Kohilathas My letter to the GMC. https://www.drkohilathas.co.uk/ruminations/protect-our-children The GMC eventually got back to me. They replied, a few sentences, saying that this issue wasn't theirs basically. Children were needlessly going to be harmed and killed. And they could only muster up a few sentences saying that this wasn't their problem.

I was distraught. At that moment I lost all trust and hope in all instititions. We must protect our health and freedoms individually. We cannot rely on others. We have to protect our children. Some of you may not believe me but when I was writing the "excess deaths" and "myocarditis" sections in the book, I was struck with a left sided chest pain. I felt I wasn't going to wake up the next morning. I felt I was going to die. Was it a form of somatisation, or gastric reflux, or costochondritis? Maybe. But to me it was real. And even though I felt like it would kill me, I continued to exercise and go for walks. I made complete peace with death. The pain also gave me an insight into what people like @oneadds and others were having to deal with everyday. I likely had only 1% of what many suffer with now, and my pain subsided. I was lucky.

My sympathy towards those with cardiac damage turned to empathy. Looking back, that chest pain was a blessing for me. I have had many experiences like this one since leaving my job. I think if you want something bad enough and it comes from love, the universe will help you in any way possible for you to achieve that purpose.

## GP
My next job was in general practice. I was working towards becoming a GP. I enjoyed understanding and looking after all sorts of patients. I'm a generalist at heart. However this transition marked another difficult time for me. On the last day of hospital medicine and just before the first day of GP, a close work colleague of mine went to play football, collapsed and never work up.

Deep down I knew what had caused this. I knew the link between mRNA tech and myocarditis early on. I cried finding this information out. I cried in front of my mother for the first time in my adult life. I'm in fact tearing up typing this. My friend was killed. I went to his parents house to give my condolences. His parents were there, broken. He recently proposed to his fiancé. She was there too, broken. We viewed his funeral via Zoom. There's a spot in the park I dip in regularly whilst looking up at the leaves. I am reminded of him when I do this. I am reminded of how lucky I am to be alive.

Deep down, I was terrified about what this meant for people around the world. Time went on, and I worked in general practice. There were murmurs of bringing in mandatory jabs to all healthcare staff.

I knew this was not only unscientific and unethical, but murderous. Yet my colleagues didn't seem to care. They were safe I guess. Regardless I could not do anything about it, so I plodded along. I never stopped reading papers, writing, tweeting and sharing info. I saw patients, I saw jab related side effects, missed periods, new onset whole body inflammation, hair loss etc. I saw cognitive dissonance too. 

All of a sudden, one day, my practice asks me my full jab status. I find this odd because they knew I had to be jabbed with everything else to have worked in all the other specialties. I knew they wanted to know only one result. Whether or not I had taken the C19. I didn't lie. Told them the truth.

The next day, in a panic, they asked me to stop seeing patients face to face. They had made a decision as a team, without me, that I was no longer able to see patients.

They felt that I wa a threat to them and I would scare them away. I have never had C19, I worked on my health and immunity every day and I purposely breathed in the virus in ED to stimulate T cells.+++(5)+++ I knew jabs increased ones risk of infection and showed them evidence.

I was the least risky person in the practice and I knew it. They didn't care. They didn't care about evidence. They didn't care about ethics. About immunity. About anything. I shrugged this off and called patients instead.

I was ostracized at work and many colleagues acted cold towards me. I was alone, but not lonely, I had science. Many doctors had to take sick leave off work due to C19 multiple times. I had meetings discussing my jab status.

A doc with myocarditis on long term meds lost jab urged me to get the shot. One said I was "too principled". It was surreal. They admitted it was all politics. I asked them why they didn't read papers? I asked them about T cells? Silence. 

I wanted to become a doctor since the age of 6. I love biology and enjoy helping people using my knowledge. But I understood that I was getting stupider and working in an environment that was harming people. I had many sleepless nights thinking about leaving.

## Freedom
One morning, after parking my car at work, I felt a warmth around my head. It had no words, but if it did it told me that everything will be okay. As soon as I had that experience, my decision was made and I felt light, a colossal weight had been lifted. I asked to quit, and a few meetings later (carried out to make sure I wasn't crazy), I left healthcare and then deregistered myself off the medical register.

I wanted to be totally free. I needed to be. The flat my girlfriend and I were planning to buy fell through. I was in financial turmoil. My mother cried for weeks. I was lost, but I was free. I wasn't part of the killing system.

I did what I only knew, I began writing. I started a Patreon and am grateful for those who did and continue to contribute to that. But it wasn't enough. I ended up being on the dole for just less than a year.

The guy I had to call every 2 weeks was surprised I was once a doc. I began learning and researching everything I could to help people who had been jabbed. I knew what was going on and I didn't want another pandemic to happen. I wanted to save as many lives as possible. I would take my bike, cycle across the park to my local library and work feverishly every day till close.

Around this time I was permanently suspended on Twitter for stating facts. I see this as a blessing now, as it made me work even harder to produce something that could never be banned. A book.

I worked and researched to make sure I got this book out before 2023. I was blessed around this time to come in contact with @ake2306 , he introduced me to other people injured by the shots. I was determined to make sure their voices got heard.

I included their stories in the book.
During this time on my walks, I experienced many insights and extraordinary experiences that many may not believe or call me crazy. I saw light, and I ended my fears. Before the new year, I released my book, "Calling Out The Shots".

It goes through what genetic agents are, what they do to our bodies, how we can improve our immunity, ways we may mitigate jab damage and what we need to do as a society to heal. callingouttheshots.xyz (Calling Out The Shots Questioning the science behind COVID-19 genetic agents; shedding light on jab-related injuries; helping you understand the powers of natural immunity; and exploring what you might be able to do about … http://www.callingouttheshots.xyz )

My only aim now is to help heal and free mankind. To me, it is the most important book ever written. Even if I am killed, the book will live. The book marks my first gift to the world. I am working on many more, and other projects. I will fight for humanity until my final breath.

Through my toils I have come to know some extraordinary people. Though I have seen and experienced evil. I have also seen God and light in mankind as well. I know we will be alright. They've banned me multiple times. What's stopping them from banning me again? To always stay in the loop. Please subscribe 🙏🏾 Dr. Kohilathas https://www.drkohilathas.co.uk/subscribe

Just woke up, my mind is racing, it makes sense having to reflect on everything that has happened over the last few years. I obviously haven't mentioned everything I witnessed. Maybe I'll use this thread jot down events that happened as I remember them again.
