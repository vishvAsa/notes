      <description>&lt;p&gt;Questions to Ask Before Surgery&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;surgical-care&#34;&gt;Surgical Care&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans will undergo surgery each year. It is important to be informed about the surgery being recommended, particularly if it is elective surgery (an operation you choose to have done), rather than an emergency surgery.

Some people find it helpful to write their questions down ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
