Adequate explanation needs to be given in elective procedures as to what to expect in terms of improvement in symptoms and quality of life and what may not improve -  important to avoid patient being disappointed later. Before embarking on a procedure, other options including medical management need to be be clearly discussed. In emergency life saving procedures a detailed discussion my not be possible before but atleast after the procedure, a detailed discussion is in order.
