## Medical journal politicization

### Lab leak and China
- 1) Feb 2020 Lancet carried a letter signed by 18 researchers who showed Solidarity with researchers from China.That is fine as researchers and scientists often don't get involved in politics but the tone of Lancet was to give clean chit to China.
- 2) April 2020 NEJM carried the article which was diplomatic and brought in several possibilities how the virus could have come. One of the author in that article is Dr Peter Daszak the controversial researcher whose lab has worked on Gain of Function work.
- 3)Science on May 14th 2021 published the letter from the Stanford microbiologist who asked for a free and open investigation to find about the lab leak angle. So for,this is the only unbiased call from the scientific community published in a journal.
- 4) Nature on May 27th 2021 published an article which portrays asking any investigation on the part of Chinese researchers looks like bullying.
