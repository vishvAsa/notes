- For progression (motivating treatment), see [effects](../Effects) page
- No CT scans for mild symptoms not requiring oxygen. (like exposing yourselves to 300-400 chest X Ray's in one go - or  3.6 years of natural exposure. Some have had 2-3 scans in 10 day hospitalisation. life time additional risk of getting a fatal cancer: 1/25k. ) A Chest X ray can tell you all that along with Oxygen saturation.

##  Protocols
- FLCCC protocol
  - [Prevention and management](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Alliance-I-MASKplus-Protocol-ENGLISH.pdf)
  - [Treatment](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FLCCC-Protocols-%E2%80%93-A-Guide-to-the-Management-of-COVID-19.pdf).
- AIIMS guidelines [here 202104](https://twitter.com/AIIMSRDA/status/1385311406182965249/photo/1).
- AIIMS & ICMR protocol
- Maharashtra protocol
- Karnataka protocol
- Telengana protocol
- Kerala protocol
- Tamil Nadu protocol
- WHO recommendations [20200902](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3379).

### Vishvas's preferred protocol
- Same as FLCCC protocol.
- Recall disease progression.
- Ivermectin at the first symptom. Details [here](ivermectin).
- Immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory fluvoxamine seems useful.
- In case of slippage to the second phase - steroids and blood-thinners (see Matthew Varghese protocol).

### Mathew Varghese protocol
- [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJzo6JIqhCw)
- Understand the expected progression of the disease.
- Note down the day of the first symptoms (not what troubled them the most). Very critical in determining proper and timely treatment - day or 2 calculation error may result in hospitalisation. Don't rely on the tests - watch the symptoms.
- Wait till the first phase is over (3 or 4 days after first symptoms). NO steroids or blood thinners here - lest you foil the immune system even as the viruses are multiplying.
- If you notice signs of second phase (autoimmune attacks on blood vessels leading to persistent fever, cough, breathing problem) - start steroids and anti-coagulants/ blood thinners (21 day regimen because tendency for clotting remains so long).
  - Don't wait for blood saturation to drop and loose time being ignorant of severely damanged lungs! (People with one l lung can have 100% blood O2 saturation). 
- If you're deep into the second phase without timely treatment - bad luck - you need oxygenation - all they way to 16 liters depending on severity. If problem persists, you may need CPAP+++(← constant pressure)+++, BiPAP+++(← differing pressure during inhalation and exhalation)+++, and ventilators.
- Counter steroid side effects
  - On 4th day fever may return due to opportunistic bacterial infection leading to pneumonia. Only here are antibiotics useful.
  - Deal with diabetes exacerbation.

## Symptomatic treatment
- Multivitamins + Cough Syrup + Anti-allergics + Paracetamol (650 mg for adults). The goal from Day 1 has to be to keep fever low if it is high: Hydrate (High fluid intake) + Steam + Paracetamol.
- Keep monitoring disease severity (see [diagnosis](../diagnosis/) page.)


## Oxygen supply
- Pronal breathing demo [here](https://twitter.com/DNeurosx/status/1383848158430588935)
- Severe cases:
    - If oxygen levels are falling below 90 and there is access to a concentrator, please use it. If levels are extremely low (<80), high pressure cylinders are needed; if not, concentrators are useful to maintain levels above 90.
    - Prone (face-down) ventilation useful.
    - BengaLUru supply: [covid.army site](https://covid.army/bangalore)
    - Below 70% doctors usually say 50:50 chances..

## Hospitals and help - bengaLUru
- Beds, ventilators etc. [here](https://covid-19-hospital-data.el.r.appspot.com/?location=Bangalore).


## Case severity
- Non-severe - not the other two levels
- Severe - Sp2 < .9. Respiratory rate > 30 in adults.
- See [diagnosis](../diagnosis/) page.
- Critical
    - Life sustaining treatment needed
    - Acute respiratory syndrome
    - Sepsis
    - Septic shock

## Natural response
- The earlier your body makes the antibody response,more likely you will make a recovery and come out at the other end.
- Those who succumb,make the delayed response with antibodies by the time virus has already gone hiding to various organs.
