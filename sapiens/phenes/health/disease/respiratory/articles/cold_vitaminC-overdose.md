HOW TO STOP A COLD IN ITS TRACKS (or significantly reduce its severity and length).

As soon as you feel a cold coming on take **5 to 7 grams** of effervescent  Vit C +++(makes fizzy drink)+++ for **2 or 3 days**. Take in hot water, **a gram or two every 3 hours**. Sip slowly and let it hit the back of the throat if your throat is sore.

I've been doing this for over 20years, nothing comes close.

***The key is to catch the cold as soon as possible and to mega-dose. Not doing this reduces it's effect**

One gram effervescent Vit C in 20 tablet tubes can be bought at any supermarket or pharmacist. Own supermarket brand is cheapest.
