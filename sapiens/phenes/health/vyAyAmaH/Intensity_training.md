> The aim of an interval (or HIIT) session is to arrive DOA at the end of the session not in the middle of the session.

> All the immediate responses to intense exercise looks bad, yet the effects are good. You are 'harming' your body to improve it. Never, ever, confuse acute with chronic.

- A 2005 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that after just two weeks of interval training, six of the eight college-age men and women doubled their endurance, or the amount of time they could ride a bicycle at moderate intensity before exhaustion. Researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, had the exercisers sprint for 30 seconds, then either stop or pedal gently for four minutes.
