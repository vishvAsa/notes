## Single leg exercises
As I've got older squatting feels more natural and less harmful than single-leg exercises.

Single leg stuff hurts my knees - it doesnt matter how strong you are if your knees are wrecked.

I'm certain that heavy single leg exercises and knees over toes are going to mess up a lot of people. Either way, try things out for yourself and find out what suits you.
