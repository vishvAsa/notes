Running reveals your fragility.

Years ago an overweight friend of mine started running (v.slowly). During the second run he hurt his back, so he stopped running because it was bad for him.

Someone tries to sprint after 20years of not running fast - they pull a hamstring..."sprinting is dangerous at my age". 

Another person resumes running after a decade off, within two weeks they get achilles tendonitis, so they stop running and take up rucking.

Is the problem with running? No.  
The problem is the body carrying 'silent' fragilities or injuries which running reveals.  

- The overweight person with the bad back. 
- The deconditioned individual who falls apart from the dynamic effort of sprinting. 
- The person who rucks or cycles because they can't run - a bad knee, lack of endurance, etc

There are millions of people over 30 who can't or won't run - not because running is bad  
but that if you have a silent injury, a joint problem, chronic muscle strains, too much weight, stiff degraded tendons -  
running will mercilessly showcase them.+++(5)+++

If you can no longer run (especially, run fast),  
don't dress it up as 

> "running is bad for someone of my age, that's why I cycle, ruck, walk..." 

what you are really signaling is your body has degraded so much that you are avoiding an activity which tells you as much.
