The way to protect your body from the stress of fast explosive movements is to do fast explosive movements.

I've increased the variety and the amount of jumps, weighted jumps, bounds, fast concentrics, heavy explosive leg extensions...lower limb work. But I've added explosive chin-ups and dips, hypers - weighted and unweighted.

I aggressively attack all gym exercises and have only a short rest between sets, as long rests dissipate psychological energy. I workout mid-morning which I realise is when I have the highest psychological attack mentality.

Power and explosiveness, decelerative and accelerative force are the things which degrade first if you dont use them. These are the MAIN qualities which make you feel dynamically robust and young in older age. This on top of a good aerobic base is a superpower.

Tendons degrade in old age if they are not regularly stressed with high load, explosive force. I'm doing this for my whole body, not just my legs.

Decades of training means I know how much of this work I can tolerate, and that excellent sleep is key to recovery and to have the psychological aggression to attack the workout.

Intent and the the ability to deliver dynamic force, weighted or unweighted, has become a key part of my gym training. My body is conditioned for it, do not jump (pardon the pun) into this sort of training if you are not conditioned for it.

KPIs as you age: The ability to sprint, the ability to jump, the ability to quickly switch 'on and off', the ability to react, the ability to accelerate, the ability to do these things without getting injured. Superpower.
