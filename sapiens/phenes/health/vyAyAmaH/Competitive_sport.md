- Hyper competition is negative. 
  
## Injury
- "Getting injured is par for the course. Nothing as common. That's one of the reasons why competitive sport is not healthy."
- Chronic hard training for competition leads to injury for 95% older athletes.

## Maximum Tolerated Dose
> Athletes *have* to embrace 'Maximum Tolerated Dose' - in real life it's not clever, but competitive sport is not real life. Utilising MTD means you WILL get injured. The Road to Optimisation is paved with hell and injury. In competitive sport you up titrate the training until most of the time you feel like sh*t - but 5-10% of the time you feel superhuman.

## Marathon etc..

> 'Men who regularly took part in marathons, ironman triathlons & cycling events were found to have a vascular age a decade older than their chronological age' - Telegraph 2023

Long-distance *training* has chronic harm built in.
