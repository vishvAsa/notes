## Technique
- Relaxed upper body swinging side to side with each step.
- When your feet land, make sure that knee angle is not obtuse (ie decelerating). For accelerating, obviously angle will be more acute.
- Long runs - " Do not run too fast early on, even if it feels slow, you will pay for it later!"

## Knee impact
- Excessive running (beyond 4.5h per week?) can lead to damage.
- Force on knee parts when running is about 8x body weight per step (cf walking - 3x per step).
