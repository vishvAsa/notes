## Eating

> You eat after you catch the prey, not before.  

> Carb-loading before a workout inhibits the secretion of growth hormone. Growth hormone is necessary for growing, healing and building muscle. Resistance train while fasted for best results.

### Creatine ingestion
Studies have shown that post-workout creatine consumption leads to greater increases in lean muscle mass and strength compared to pre-workout intake. The rationale behind this timing is that after a workout, the muscles are primed for nutrient absorption due to increased blood flow and the depletion of energy stores, making them more receptive to replenishing creatine levels.
