Yoga is NOT resistance training—It only involves resistance.

What yoga DOES :

It uses your bodyweight..
1. To build mobility, flexibility, core control & balance
2. Offers controlled movements for mind-body awareness
3. It can develop muscular endurance in beginners

What yoga DOESNOT do :

1. Provides no progressive overload (main goal of resistance training)
2. Doesn’t generate mechanical tension and muscle fibre recruitment needed for muscle hypertrophy
3. Doesn’t focus on targeted movement pattern

Yoga is complementary.

YOGA for improving flexibility, mobility, breathing and mental calm.

RESISTANCE TRAINING for metabolic health issues, insulin resistance, diabetes, higher body fat %. etc
