How physical qualities degrade as you age.

I've been fit all my life. From late twenties to fifty I trained competitively. *In my experience* here's the order in which physical performance degrades.

1. Recovery takes longer. You can train just as hard but are achy for longer. Sooner or later this means that frequency of hard sessions must decrease.
2. You become more prone to injury.
3. Need for a good warm-up increases.
4. Speed degrades.
5. Reactivity and agility degrades.
6. Tolerance to acidosis and hard repeats degrades.
7. Power degrades.
8. Strength degrades.
9. Endurance degrades.

Top performance starts to degrade when recovery takes longer and injury strikes - this means that quality volume and frequency is reduced; the start of long-term slow performance decline. For a while one can retain qualities by being more intelligent with training, knowing your body, and erring on the side of caution. Eventually, the inevitable decline in performance has to be accepted.

This decline is accelerated by chronic lack of sleep, chronic under-recovery, drinking too much alcohol, not getting quality nutrition.

However! If you look after yourself, keep healthy and stay consistent with exercise, diet and lifestyle, you can remain in great physical condition throughout life 💪☀️🌿
