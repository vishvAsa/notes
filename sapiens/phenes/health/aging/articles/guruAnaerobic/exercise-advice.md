Advice for older exerciser/athletes:

- protect your back
- protect your joints, tendons and ligaments
- resist urge to do 1-rep max on squats & deads (any exercise which, if injured, would lead to severe locomotor/movement problems)
- don't overtrain
- allow for recovery
- don't sprint 100% if you are not conditioned for it
- realign your psychology to your new limitations

This doesn't mean becoming a fragile and soft older person,  
but understanding that exercise as you age is meant to enhance your quality of life,  
not lead to debilitating injury.  
Find the right balance.
