## Silent risk
- "Youth is health more so than strength. The strong 50yr old is 'healthy' in one metric but **silent risk** is increasing. This is why big powerlifters can die instantly."
- "I don't believe a superfit 60yr old can ever be as healthy as the average teenager. But they can be 'fitter' - so we have to define the **difference between fitness and health**."

## Variation
- Aging is diminishing variation. The ultimate absence of variability is death.
- "If all you do is "take it easy", eventually all you'll be able to do is take it easy - your body will have lost its capacity to generate and tolerate force, a high heart rate, acidosis, shocks or running for the bus - until eventually, even the normal task of walking up a flight of stairs is an effort and leaves you breathless." 

## Energy crisis
"Aging is partly the result of a 'cellular energy crisis' from a reduction in the number of mitochondria in the cells. The consequence is that the cells start to function less well as a result of the energy shortage. "
