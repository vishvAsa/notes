## Role in body


Magnesium is a nutrient that is essential for so many functions in the human body.

Magnesium is required to make hundreds of enzymes work and assists with thousands of others.
The most important of these is the enzyme reaction tht involves the creation of energy by activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fundamental energy storage molecule of the body.

No Magnesium = No energy.
Magnesium along with some other nutrients are essential to create structural components of the body

RNA and DNA, which contain the genetic blueprints for the formation of all the protein molecules in the body, are also dependent on magnesium.  
Electrical signal transmission along the nerves also depend on Magnesium.

Muscle cells need Magnesium inorder to relax. When there is excess calcium & not enuf Magnesium, muscles are not relaxed as it shud b.

This can cause twitches, spasms, menstrual cramps, hypertension..
Magnesium is necessary for insulin to open cell membranes for glucose.

So without adequate Magnesium, your Insulin sensitivity is decreased.

Magnesium is also a cofactor in Vitamin D activation.

Magnesium deficiency = Vitamin D deficiency!
Magnesium Deficiency can present itself with a variety of symptoms

1. Anxiety
2. Arrythmia
3. Twitching
4. Convolutions
5. High BP
6. Menstrual cramps
7. Migraines
8. Constipation
9. Muscle cramping

...
to name a few.

## Reasons for Mg deficiency

- Overuse of Potash in soil
- Acid Rain

- Food Processing
- Fluorinated water/Fluoride

- Over cooking of Vegetables
- Low stomach acid

- Excess Calcium
- Stress
- Excess Protein, Tea, Phytic acid
- Drugs
- Vitamin B1, Selenium deficiency

For this reason it's nearly impossible to get adequate amount of Magnesium from the diet alone.

However these are some of the sources of Magnesium in your diet.
Less thn 1% of the bodyâ€™s Magnesium is carried in the bloodstream. Most is present in bone & other tissues. If you are low in available Mg, your body will leach it out of your bones to supply your needs. This will make the blood Mg levels to appear ok.

So Blood tests are inaccurate!
RBC magnesium testing is the best option to get the real picture.

Hair mineral testing is also somewhat reliable.

Going by symptoms is your Best bet
Supplement

Magnesium Supplements are available in Multiple forms.

Magnesium oxide, taurate, glycinate, citrate, malate, orotate, magnesium oil..

Elemental Magnesium in all these forms are different & their absorption capacity is also different.
Generally,

Magnesium glycinate is most suitable for adults

Magnesium taurate for heart patients

Magnesium citrate (in multiple doses) for kids.

Magnesium is effectively filtered by the kidneys, so excess isn't a real problem, but magnesium has a laxative effect.


## Dose

6â€“8 mg/kg (3.0 to 4.5 mg/lb) of body weight per day for adults.

Upto 10 mg/kg/day for children & athlete's

So if you are a 70kg guy you need atleast 420mg elemental magnesium per day.

"Elemental Magnesium" is the key!

## Who shudnt Supplement Magnesium ðŸ‘‡

1. Those with compromised kidney functioning
2. Excessively slow heart rate
3. Myasthenia gravis (very rare condition)

All others shud & will benefit from supplementing Magnesium.
