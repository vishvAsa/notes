Magnesium is a nutrient that is essential for so many functions in the human body.

Magnesium is required to make hundreds of enzymes work and assists with thousands of others.
The most important of these is the enzyme reaction tht involves the creation of energy by activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the fundamental energy storage molecule of the body.

No Magnesium = No energy.
Magnesium along with some other nutrients r essential to create structural components of the body

RNA and DNA, which contain the genetic blueprints for the formation of all the protein molecules in the body, are also dependent on magnesium.
Electrical signal transmission along the nerves also depend on Magnesium.

Muscle cells need Magnesium inorder to relax. When there is excess calcium & not enuf Magnesium, muscles r not relaxed as it shud b.

This can cause twitches, spasms, menstrual cramps, hypertension..
Magnesium is necessary for insulin to open cell membranes for glucose.

So without adequate Magnesium, ur Insulin sensitivity is decreased.

Magnesium is also a cofactor in Vitamin D activation.

Magnesium deficiency = Vitamin D deficiency!
Magnesium Deficiency can present itself with a variety of symptoms

1. Anxiety
2. Arrythmia
3. Twitching
4. Convolutions
5. High BP
6. Menstrual cramps
7. Migraines
8. Constipation
9. Muscle cramping
...
to name a few.
Reasons for Mg deficiency

❌ Overuse of Potash in soil
❌ Acid Rain
❌ Food Processing
❌ Over cooking of Vegetables
❌ Fluorinated water/Fluoride
❌ Low stomach acid
❌ Excess Calcium
❌ Stress
❌ Excess Protein, Tea, Phytic acid
❌ Drugs
❌ Vitamin B1, Selenium deficiency
For this reason it's nearly impossible to get adequate amount of Magnesium from the diet alone.

However these r some of the sources of Magnesium in ur diet.
Less thn 1% of the body’s Magnesium is carried in the bloodstream. Most is present in bone & other tissues. If u r low in available Mg, ur body will leach it out of ur bones to supply ur needs. This will make the blood Mg levels to appear ok.

So Blood tests r inaccurate!
RBC magnesium testing is the best option to get the real picture.

Hair mineral testing is also somewhat reliable.

Going by symptoms is ur Best bet
Supplement

Magnesium Supplements r available in Multiple forms.

Magnesium oxide, taurate, glycinate, citrate, malate, orotate, magnesium oil..

Elemental Magnesium in all these forms r different & their absorption capacity is also different.
Generally,

Magnesium glycinate is most suitable for adults

Magnesium taurate for heart patients

Magnesium citrate (in multiple doses) for kids.

Magnesium is effectively filtered by the kidneys, so excess isn't a real problem, but magnesium has a laxative effect.
Dose..

6–8 mg/kg (3.0 to 4.5 mg/lb) of body weight per day for adults.

Upto 10 mg/kg/day for children & athlete's

So if u r a 70kg guy u need atleast 420mg elemental magnesium per day.

"Elemental Magnesium" is the key!
Who shudnt Supplement Magnesium 👇

1. Those with compromised kidney functioning

2. Excessively slow heart rate

3. Myasthenia gravis (very rare condition)

All others shud & will benefit from supplementing Magnesium.
