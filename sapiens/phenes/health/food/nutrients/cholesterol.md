## Neutrality in most
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. 

Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. The body tightly regulates the amount of cholesterol in the blood by controlling its production of cholesterol. When your dietary intake of cholesterol goes down, your body makes more.

### Hyperresponders
In 40% of the population (“hyperresponders”), high-cholesterol foods raise blood cholesterol levels. Dietary cholesterol modestly increases LDL in these individuals - general increase in LDL particles typically reflects an increase in large LDL particles — not small, dense LDL. In fact, people who have mainly large LDL particles have a lower risk of heart disease. Hyperresponders also experience an increase in HDL particles.

## Function
Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods.

If you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries.

## Cholesterol lowerers
