## Pulses
### sattu
#### Perparation
For sattu, Bengal gram is first soaked in water and dried under the sun; it’s then roasted using a traditional technique called bhoojna, where a cast-iron wok is placed on a wood-fired chulha (stove), the wok is partially filled with sand and Bengal gram is roasted in it. The sand ensures even distribution of heat and takes out all the moisture from the legume, while keeping its nutrients intact. The roasted gram is then milled along with the husk. This cooking process imparts an earthy taste and aroma to the final product, and also ensures it lasts longer.

#### Consumption
- can be mixed and drunk with water + salt or sugar.
