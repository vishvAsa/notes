### Shooting
Exposure during shooting occurs because most primers on the market (except for “Green Primers”) contain lead styphnate. It is the compound in a primer that makes the “bang” happen. Once the primer is ignited, the lead particulates are disbursed in the air. Another area where shooters are exposed to lead is during the setup or resetting of steel targets. Once a projectile impacts a target, the copper plating/metal jacket/synthetic coating is ruptured and the lead core fragments/spalls on the steel. This coats the steel plates with a layer of lead that gets transferred to your hands when you are setting up/resetting. Reloading is another significant contributor to lead exposure. Lead can be found in and on spent and new primers, dirty cases before you wash/tumble, and bullets themselves (depends greatly on if you use cast/fmj/plated/coated projectiles).
