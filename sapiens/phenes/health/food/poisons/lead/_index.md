Children: A meta-analysis of studies from 2010 to 2018 reported an average BLL of 6.86 μg/dL in Indian children . Another study found that children under 2 years old had an average BLL of 4.9 μg/dL, which is over eight times higher than the U.S. average of 0.6 μg/dL for the same age group . ￼ from chatgpt


## Blood Testing

Technique Typical Detection Limit for Pb  
ICP-AAS ~ 1–10 µg/L (ppb)  
Graphite Furnace AAS (GFAAS) ~ 0.1–1 µg/L (ppb)  
ICP-OES (Optical Emission) ~ 0.5–10 µg/L (ppb)  
ICP-MS (Mass Spectrometry) ~ <0.01 µg/L (ppb)

## UV scintillation test
Methylammonium bromide (CH₃NH₃Br) reacts with lead bromide (PbBr₂) to form methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr₃), a hybrid perovskite material. 

CH₃NH₃Br + PbBr₂ = MAPbBr₃

MAPbBr₃ exhibits a red-orange color and has a perovskite crystal structure. Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr₃) exhibits strong absorbance in the ultraviolet (UV) range (including the common 395 NM UV-torch-light). When exposed to extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation, MAPbBr₃ undergoes scintillation, where high-energy photons excite multiple charge carriers per photon, leading to intense emission. Scintillation decay time can be as fast as 0.1 nanoseconds.

Perovskite structure is important for scintillation. Cu, Zn and Fe Methylammonium bromides don't form this structure.
