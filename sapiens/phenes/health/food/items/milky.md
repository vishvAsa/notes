## Milk
- Nandini pasteurised toned milk 3% fat, non-fat solids (snf) 8.5% - 39Rs/L in 2023.

### Processing
#### Homogenization
Homogenising milk involves the removal of the cream that appears as a layer at the top of the milk and which makes the milk to lose its freshness very fast.

##### Impact
Homogenised milk is not natural - we're evolved to cope with butterfat globules (BFG) of a certain size in our mother’s milk. Lactose intolerance could be connected?

Digestion easier for homogenised milk. Fat globules etc.. in the milk are broken down into smaller particles.

Even undesirable particles are absorbed - supposedly increases cancer risk. 

Essential vitamins like Vitamin A and D are broken down.

#### Pasteurization
Prevents transmission of bovine TB.

##### 30m technique
Heating the milk to between 63˚C and 64˚C and maintaining that temperature for 30 minutes.

If it reaches or exceeds 64.5˚C it becomes sticky - cleaning vessel is hard.


##### 15s technique
High-Temp Short-Time (HTST) protocol.  
Heat the milk in pipework to 73˚C and run it through the pipes at that temperature for 15 seconds. 

Worsens milk taste.

## Ghee

### Manufacturing process
> Buffalo milk contains 6-7% fat(Ghee), 9% SNF (Proteins, carbohydrate and minerals) and 84-85% water.
>
> At home, Ghee is made by converting milk into Dahi; Dahi into Butter; and finally Butter into ghee. In the process, SNF part is wasted as lassi or chhachh.
>
> At industrial level, cream is separated from milk mechanically and cream is converted into Butter which in turn is boiled to make ghee. SNF part is not wasted but converted into Skimmed Milk Powder which fetches good price.
>
> It is mainly because of utilisation of SNF part that industrial or packed ghee is cheaper than the home made ghee. There is no difference in nutritive value or chemical composition. Only difference is that home made ghee has typical flavour of Dahi due to diacetyl.

## Lactase
- Amul mozarella diced cheese + yogurt in afternoon and evening led to flatulance and loose stools in V.
- According to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, evidence shows that the bacterial cultures used in making yogurt produce some of the lactase enzyme.
