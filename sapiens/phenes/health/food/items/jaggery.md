## Adultration
Problem is that jaggery blocks are oft adultrated.  

Fake Organic claims: 

> I do get bits of plastic now and then with powdered jaggery. But if you dilute the block jaggery, you will find particles for sure. I buy organic branded products from Amazon. But yes, most of them are namesake organic, we donâ€™t have any chance to check if they are authentic /genuine. -SN, Bengaluru, 2021

## Purity test
### Color
Pure jaggery is naturally dark brown or black in color. If the jaggery is an unusually vibrant color, it may have artificial colors. 

### Smell
Pure jaggery has a sweet, earthy aroma. If it smells chemical or pungent, it may be adulterated. 

### Taste
Pure jaggery has a rich, molasses-like flavor and is extremely sweet. If it tastes bitter or salty, or has a metallic aftertaste, it may be adulterated. 

### Texture
Pure jaggery has a consistent texture. If it feels too hard or soft, it may be adulterated with rock salt or gypsum. 

### Dissolution
Pure jaggery dissolves easily in water and leaves minimal residue. If it leaves a gritty or sandy residue, it may be adulterated. 



### Hydrochloric acid test
Add a few drops of hydrochloric acid (HCL) to some crushed jaggery in a test tube. If the jaggery bubbles, it may be mixed with impurities like baking soda or washing powder. 

### Chalk test
Add a chunk of chalk powder to jaggery in a bowl or vessel. If the chalk powder settles down, the jaggery may be adulterated. 

### Alcohol test
Mix half a teaspoon of jaggery with six milliliters of alcohol, then add 20 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid. If the jaggery turns pink, it may have artificial colors.
