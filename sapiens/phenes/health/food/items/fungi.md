## Mushrooms
### Edibility
> A general thumb rule is to avoid (even touching) bright/bold coloured mushrooms.  
> Another rule is based on observation - if we can see any other mammals consuming it, it is safe to try a small amount to test for human consumption.

> More than 90% fungal species are not yet identified and of those indenfied, less than 2% are edible.
