There is a rising "health consciousness" in America that advocates the consumption of "good" proteins and aliphatic carboxylates and recommends wild animals (mammals, birds and fishes) as their primary sources. We do not think this would be sustainable for the population as a whole. The same folks are unlikely to consume insects like cockroaches and the like. This fad of super health is probably only for rich American hunter-gatherers whose lives are otherwise antithetical to that of genuine HGs. 

In our opinion, this neo-HG fetish is a wholly misplaced one. Rather one needs to embrace the fact that there has been selection for variation and duplication of the Amylase genes on multiple occasions during Neolithicization, rather than demonize it and return to some legendary HG state.

During the Neolithic period, the shift to agriculture led to repeated natural selection for individuals with more copies of the amylase gene, enhancing their ability to digest starchy foods. This evolutionary adaptation was crucial for the survival and success of early agricultural societies.
