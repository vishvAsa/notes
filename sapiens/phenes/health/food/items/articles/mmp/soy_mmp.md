Soy is seen by many as a cheap vegetarian/vegan alternative source of Protein & a health food. Let's take a closer look at Soy & debug some of these claims.

## PROTEIN

- Unlike other sources of Plant protein, Soy is a complete one.
- It has all the 9 essential Amino acids
- But Soy has less amounts of Sulfur containing Amino acids; Methionine & Cysteine.
- Almost half the amount as in eggs (Amino acid profile of Tofu in Pic)

### PROTEASE INHIBITORS

- Protease is a enzyme that breaks down proteins into amino acids.
- Beans & many other foods contain Protease Inhibitors. They mess with the action of Proteases.
- The 2 main types of protease inhibitors found in soybeans are Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors and Bowman-Birk inhibitors.
- The level of protease inhibitors in soybeans can vary depending on the variety of soybean, the processing method, and the storage conditions.
- Heat deactivates most, but not all of the Protease Inhibitors.

## ‚ùå FLATULENCE

- Soy, like other beans, are rich in 2 Oligosaccharides (carbs) called Raffinose & Stachyose.
- Humans don't have enzyme to digest these properly.
- Once they reach the large intestine the bacteria ferments it, resulting in production of Gas.
- They are heat stable & hence cooking has less effect on them.
- Fermentation can reduce the amount of these sugars, which is why Fermented soy like Tempeh, Natto, Miso etc are less of an issue in this regard.

## PHYTATES

- Phytates are compounds found in beans, grains etc.
- üî¥ They prevent premature germination & acts as a phosphorus store.
- The problem with phytates is that they bind with minerals like Zinc, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron etc & hinder their absorption.
- Soybeans contain more phytates than other legumes. 3 times more than Mung beans & 4 times as Chickpea
- This is especially problematic for Vegetarians as their diet contains less of Iron, Zinc etc in the first place.

## LECTINS

- Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins which are commonly found in plants
- They can attach to specific sugars on the surface of cells, often causing immune system reactions and blood clotting.
- Soy lectins bind to the villi and crypt cells of the small intestine.
- This contributes to diminished capacity for digestion and absorption & a shift in the gut microbiome.
- Lectins when they enter the bloodstream via a leaky gut can cause an immune response.

## PHYTOESTROGENS

- Phytoestrogens are compounds in plants that are structurally similar to Estrogen
- Isoflavones are the most common of the Phytoestrogens & its concentration is highest in Soy.
  - Actual Isoflavone content depends on variety & processing technique
- Soy phytoestrogens such as genistein can inhibit 17-hydroxysteroidoxido reductase, an enzyme that is required for the synthesis of testosterone.
- If consumed in high enough doses or during critical stages of development, they can cause several reproductive disorders.

## GOITROGENS

- Goitrogens are substances that block the synthesis of thyroid hormones.
- In Soy, Isoflavones are the main Goitrogen.
- They are potent inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase (TPO), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of T3 & T4.
- This can cause a drop in the Thyroid hormone levels & an increase in TSH.
- Goitrogens also damage thyroid function is by increasing concentrations of thyroid binding globulin (TBG), a plasma protein involved in the inactivation & transport of T3 & T4.

## Summary
To Summarise:

- Soy is a store house of Antinutrients. Add to this the problem of Heavy metals, Herbicides etc, Soy is a toxic mess.
- Fermented soy like Natto, Miso that are traditionally consumed in the east are less harmful than processed Soy.
- Studies often give Soy a green signal because these subtle effects are missed when considered in smaller quantities. But these negative effects do add up.
- Considering how powerful the soy industry is, do not expect a legit study coming out at Soy.
- But there is enough evidence to its harmful effect & that's why you should avoid eating soy.
- And for the Sake of your Kids & their hormones, dont give them Baby food & Formulas, with Soy in them.

SOY is totally NOT worth it!
