Coconut oil is extracted from the dried flesh of the coconut.

It is made up of 86 percent saturated fat, 6 percent monounsaturated fat, and 1.4 percent polyunsaturated fat. About half of the saturated fat in it is a rare, special type of saturated fat called lauric acid. It is known as a medium-chain triglyceride or MCT.

## MCT
In the body, lauric acid converts to monolaurin, one of the compounds found in breast milk that boost a babyâ€™s immune system. It is like superfuel for your cells, your metabolism, your bones, and your brain. MCTs also have been shown to possess antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. 

Unlike Omega 6 fats from seed oils that are transported into the lymphatic system (which allows them to be taken up in ur fat tissues), MCTs get absorbed directly from the gut to the liver & burned quickly. This is why MCT oils boost ur metabolism & help u burn more calories, reduce fat storage, and cut ur appetite

Coconut oil improves ur lipid profile. It may increase ur total cholesterol slightly, but that's bcz HDL increases. LDL & Triglyceride is shown to come down as well.

Coconut oil is a very good option for high heat cooking.
