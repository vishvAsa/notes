## Variation
- Variety in food is important. Nature enforced it in days past.

## Vegetarianism
- One review found that mortality from coronary heart disease was 24% lower in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians. Studies of cancer have not shown clear differences in cancer rates between vegetarians and non-vegetarians. There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index, lower risk of obesity, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower homocysteine levels, lower risk of high blood pressure, and lower risk of type 2 diabetes. One large prospective study found that non-meat-eaters had only half the risk of meat eaters of requiring an emergency appendectomy. [\[Ref\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_nutrition)

### Veganism
- "long-term vegan is harmful but intermittent veganism isn’t."

## Eggs
- Eggs have a bad reputation because of their high cholesterol content: 210 milligrams in the yolk of a large egg. ... Eating three eggs a day for 30 days increased cholesterol in susceptible people, but their LDL particles were larger, and there was no change in the ratio between LDL and HDL, which suggests no major change in coronary risk. More significantly, eggs do not appear to contribute to heart disease in most people. A pivotal study from Harvard in 1999, of nearly 120,000 men and women, found no association between eggs—up to one a day—and heart disease, except in people with diabetes. Nor did it find a link between eggs and strokes.
