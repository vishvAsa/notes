## Adultration
- Household tests - [eatright site](https://eatrightindia.gov.in/dart/).

## Variation
- Variety in food is important. Nature enforced it in days past.

## Vegetarianism
- One review found that mortality from coronary heart disease was 24% lower in vegetarians than in nonvegetarians. Studies of cancer have not shown clear differences in cancer rates between vegetarians and non-vegetarians. There is evidence that vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index, lower risk of obesity, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower homocysteine levels, lower risk of high blood pressure, and lower risk of type 2 diabetes. One large prospective study found that non-meat-eaters had only half the risk of meat eaters of requiring an emergency appendectomy. [\[Ref\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_nutrition)

### Veganism
- "long-term vegan is harmful but intermittent veganism isnâ€™t."
