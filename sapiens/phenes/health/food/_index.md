## Grains

Need staple food source of carbohydrates. Brown rice. Oats (lowers bad
cholesterol). Whole wheat (eg: Couscous, bread).

### Pseudograins

These are not from the grass family. The following are high in proteins
and nutritious: Quinoa, Buckwheat groats (not related to wheats).

## Fruits

### Fruit juices

Avoid prune, plum, apple juices as they have caused diarrhoea in the past. 

Avoid fruit juices in general, as they provide many calories, without other good things like pulp and fiber.

### Long lasting fruits

Cucumber. Capsicum.

## Oil and fat

### Olive oil

Consider olive oil, to avoid hydrogenated oil. Buy high quality (extra
virgin) olive oil. Beware that there is much mislabeling. Do not buy
extra-light olive oil (it is refined, clear and bland).

## Vegetables and fungi

Buy frozen, pre-cut, pre-cleaned vegetables; or dried vegetables
(available in chinese stores) for easy cooking without compromising on
nutrition.

## Milk products

### Artificial Hormone avoidance

Avoid yogurt from cows injected with growth harmones, or with gelatin in
them.

### Whey

Isolate is lactose free, while concentrate is not; but the latter has
more immune-system boosters.

## Spices

Vertain Indian spice powders (even in USA) are contaminated with lead
(see elsewhere). Prefer seeds and leaves which you can easily grind
instead.
