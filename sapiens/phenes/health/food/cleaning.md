Rinse well. (washing in tap water alone can reduce by 26.7–62.9%)

Soaking (5m-20m) in alaline solution eliminates some acidic pesticide residues.  
draws out pests as well.

Alkaline solutions:

- baking soda NaHCO₃ (ph 8.3). 12-15 min soaking. can reduce pesticide residues by 66.7–98.9%,
- Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) 0.001 percent dilute. 5m soaking
- salt??
