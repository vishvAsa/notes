I believe that's the scholar desi sAngy'e gyAtso who wrote the treatise on the transmission of Hindu medicine to the bauddha-s termed "A feast to delight the R^iShi-s". He was patronized by Gushri Khan the son of Tengri To and descendent of Qasar brother of Chingiz Khan.

An example of the ding-dong snakeoil a well-known white indologist/tibetologist tries to sell -

> ninth centuries C.E., and even as the Buddha's teaching began to establish itself there, it was but one of several foreign ways of culture with which the Tibetans were be- coming familiar. Besides Tibet's ancient indigenous traditions, that are still percep- tible both in their persistent survivals and in elements of the earliest written records, early medieval Tibet knew of Chinese historiography and Greek medicine, Nepalese sculpture and Sogdian textiles, Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism.2 

Within the Tibetan medical tradition itself they attribute the teachings of medicine to the tathAgata-s such as a the nIlakaNTha bhaiShajya guru: a transparent reformulation of rudra in the garbha of a tathAgata. However,in their tradition they clearly acknowledge that the science had original daiva origins. They state that the prajApati composed text called siddha-darpaNa; the ashvin-s composed a text the siddhasAra saMhitA; indra composed two texts known as the saMkShipta siddhasAra & udaravyUha (the anatomy of the abdomen). They further state that the it was transmitted by the nAstika goddess vasudhArA in the form of the treatise known as mANikya(?)-mAlA. Then they state that indra taught it to several v1s and each of them composed a commentary of what they had heard from indra and this became the foundation of the medical tradition. 

Then the Tibeto-Mongol tradition curiously records that the later medical tradition of Hindus (called tIrthika-s) by nAstika-s arose in the form of shaiva medical tantra-s which were generated by rudra at the request of viShNu, kR^iNavAma(?), rAhula, umA & yakShakala. They say these shaiva medical tantras were: parama-guhya-rahasya-shveta&kR^iShNa-tantra-s produced from rudra's jaTa; the vega-gamana-tantra from his kunDala; the nIlalohita-nADi-tantra from his necklace; the vIroddhAraka-tantra from his upavIta; kR^iShNa-shveta-maNDUka-tantra from his anklets. 

Then they go on to rather smugly claim that the tathAgata himself taught the shaiva medical tantra known as mahAkAleshvara to the Hindus. 

I've not seen any of these shaiva medical works though we know from H sources including vAgbhaTa that such might have existed. Thus, the Tibeto-Mongol tradition medical tradition points to the existence of a now lost tradition of shaiva medical tantra-s.

The Tibeto-Mongol tradition also record a surgery performed by punarvasu Atreya to extract a cysticercus from the brain of a patient: however, they attribute the correct teaching to the advise of a tAthAgata (who in reality is merely a bhArgava who is claimed to be one).

> charaka, sushruta etc. advancing hindu medicine => nAstika-s gaining huge converts among sino-hunnics

Quite true.
