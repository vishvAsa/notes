Arfa and her ilk today are seething over the image of Dhanvantari, the God of Ayurveda. But once upon a Time her Arab Masters had copied their knowledge of medicine from Sushruta, Charaka etc who credited all their work to the same Dhanvantari.

## 1. Rabban Al Tabari:

The first encyclopaedia of medicine in Arabic was Rabban Al Tabari’s Firdous Al Hikmah.

His work was highly influenced by Indian physicians such as Sushruta & Charaka.

A.L Balsham writes that Rabban Al Tabari mentions the works of Hindu Aurvedic practitioners like Charaka, Sushruta, Madhava & Vaghbata who all credited their achievements in the field of medical science to Dhanvantari that Arfa’s religious brethrens hates so much.


Historia De la Medicina, a comprehensive history dedicated to the study of medical knowledge and practices mentions Al Tabari devoted the last 36 chapters of his Firdaus Al-Hikma to describing Indian medicine citing Sushruta, Charaka & Ashtanga Hridaya.

Aha! They were even using our Ayurvedic Shilajit as well. 

## 2. Abu Bakr Al Razi (Rhazes)
A physician during the Islamic golden age wrote two books Al-Hawi & Kitab Al Mansuri. In both this book he suggests Sushrata & Charaka.

He also credits “Min Kitab Al-Hind” -“An Indian Book”

## 3. Ibn Sina (Avicenna)

The famous physician of the Muslim world, literally learnt Arithmetic from an Indian grocer. Lol

During his time Indian science was so widely known in Baghdad that his work bears reflection to Indian science just like his contemporaries.

## 4. German Physician Meyerhof
He suggested how Indian medicine influenced Arabic medicine as there are frequent mentions of Indian names of medicins and herbs that were unknown to the Greek Medical tradition.
