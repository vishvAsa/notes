## General Techniques
Dry after use to avoid rust.

### Straight razor 
With Indian or Japanese straight razor - slide close to the skin, so that it is flat and parallel (not perpendicular!) to the skin. Can use regular soap for lather.

Keep the razor sharp. Indian straight razors allow replacable standard safety blades.

### Electric trimmer
Press and move close to the skin.  
Farther off, higher the likelihood of pain due to "hair pulling" effect.  
Ensure that the blads move smoothly and rapidly - so clean - and perhaps oil them.

Some electric trimmers tend to leave lines of untouched hair - so move the trimmer laterally and repeat the motion a few times.

### Examination and special spots
Pay special attention to usual spots of neglect - example throat, close to the ears, borders or hairline, nape of the neck.

Examination is critical - especially while shaving the head - ugly patches may be left otherwise. Use hand or phone camera or another person.

## Head shaving
Hold a small bowl in the shikhA area, trim the rest.

While self-shaving - Since one cannot see one's head well, move the cutting device laterally one stripe after another, in an orderly way; feeling each stripe.
