## Indoor
- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has deemed indoor air quality one of the top five environmental health risks the U.S. faces today. The agency says indoor levels of pollutants can be two to five times -- and sometimes more than 100 times -- as high as outdoor levels. \[[Ref](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_32/b3895118_mz070.htm)\]

## Highways
- Lung function: Researchers at the University of Southern California found that children who lived within 500 meters of a freeway since age 10 had substantial deficits in lung function by the age of 18 years. [\[Ref\]](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070125185843.htm)

## Altitude sickness
Usual formula - 2 nights for every 1km ascent beyond 2km.

### Medication
Acetazolamide / Dimox makes the body breathe faster and deeper. But side-effects include much urination and drowsiness (experienced at 250 mg). Some say 62mg is better - fewer side effects. Kids should proportionally reduce with body weight.

Some recommend taking it 24-48 hours in advance.
