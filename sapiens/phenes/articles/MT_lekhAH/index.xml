In birds a major aspect of the homing capacity appears to be magnetic sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;pegion-utilization&#34;&gt;Pegion Utilization&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since they were used early by the H, Iranians &amp;amp; Romans they were probably even used by early IEans: in support of this contention, homing is alluded to in the RV &amp;amp; the RV also mentions the pigeon as the messenger of the goddess nirR^itti &amp;amp; yama.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You find reports of both African &amp;amp; Indian elephants, captive or wild 1s in human contact playing football. Carl Akeley, who invented modern taxidermy, claimed that he has seen wild ones do so in Africa with a mud ball. If this is true were elephants the 1st to invent a ball game?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1925386982647083170&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While studying the anatomy of a shark in my youth, it became a pratyakSha to me how teeth and their scales had a common origin. This study suggests that the teeth have their ultimate origin in innervated sensory structures on skin &amp;ndash; the sensory exoskeleton &amp;ndash; and are comparable to those found in crustaceans and aglaspidid arthropods that might be related to trilobites. We suspect that while there is some structural convergence between these &amp;ldquo;skin-teeth&amp;rdquo; of arthropods and chordates, there was an ancestral sensilla in their common ancestor whose development was dependent on a tumor necrosis factor like protein Ectodysplasin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
