## Depression
- Rosenstr√∂m & Hagen found that the sex diff in depression is largely "explained" (ie correlated) by differences in strength. The sex diff in depression is mostly a formidability difference: physically stronger individuals, men or women, had lower rates of depression. 
- Possible mechanism - Most depression is caused by adversity, and both are strongly linked to *conflict*. Assault is perhaps the most potent risk factor for depression. Physical formidability might protect individuals from assault and help them prevail in a wide range of conflicts, thus reducing risk of depression.
