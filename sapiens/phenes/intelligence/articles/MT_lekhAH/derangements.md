## TDS and MDS
It's sad that some rather interesting psychological derangements are largely out of bounds for a more detailed scientific investigation. This includes the counter-religious unmAda-s& their secular mutations (navyonmAda), pogaNDaroga. 2 related conditions TDS+++(=Trump Derangement syndrome)+++ & MDS+++(=Modi derangement syndrome)+++ are also in this.

Often, people who suffer from TDS also suffer from MDS, suggesting that two come from the same or similar underlying psychological conditions. There is a v.characteristic profile of those who suffer from these conditions, which mirrors adoption of u2 & u3+ mutations in particular 

I do think that we TDS-MDS and navyonmAda have a degree of hardware software interaction.

## Lethality
> A 46-year-old man killed his wife, former partner and his two sons before shooting himself in the US state of Minnesota, authorities said. The man, identified as Anthony Nephew, would often write social media posts against US President-elect Donald Trump.

...I just read of a case of fatal TDS which is said to have claimed an entire family: we have long held that phenomena like TDS and MDS need an objective psychological study.

## MuDS
I saw that one otherwise sane and v.knowledgeable Brazilian has a muShkavAn derangement syndrome. 

## Genetics and behavior
I was talking to a coethnic friend after a long time. Though the friend is a coethnic, we have no direct relationship within a 7-generation radius, AFAIK. Yet several peculiar "isms" and quirks came up that are exactly paralleled in our respective clans. I don't think these are purely cultural but involve genetic input. That is the bond of coethnic networks which transcends merely linguistic edges
