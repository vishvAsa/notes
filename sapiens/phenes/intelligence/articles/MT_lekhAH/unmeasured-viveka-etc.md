Then there are personality traits like conscientiousness.

I also believe IQ doesn't measure what H call viveka properly

...
Indeed siddha-s are said to have siddhi-s that are clearly distinct from the cognitive capacity apprehended by IQ ... some of them indeed seem rather uncanny.

## Contrafactual models

There is a certain mental tendency  
that exists across groups to accept a patently contra-factual framework as reality.  
Once that is accepted  
the individuals who have done so work within that framework  
& to them the factual reality or pratyakSha appears delusional.  

To such people  
trying show the facts doesn't work  
because they are already inside their new pseudo-reality.  

One may say what is the problem?  
Could their reality not be equally valid even as Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptical geometry?  
No, we are not talking about axiomatic systems here  
but the process of deductions from logic.  

The old H had presented two important principles: 

1) tR^itIya-prakArAbhAvaM cha sUchayati | ity eka-pramANa-vyApAraH : in the west it is called the law of the excluded middle and lAghava-nyAya, i.e. the principle of parsimony. When you reject these as part of your framework you create an alternative that is illogical but takes the place of logic to the believers of the system. 

What we see is that high IQ offers no immunity to this  
even though those individual might use regular logic for earning their living or in certain limited domains.  
We see mathematicians & physicists who have high IQ,  
and biologists who are often confronted by the realities of life in their work  
slip into such frameworks  
that are bereft of logic and operate as "true believers".  

That this mental tendency is widespread & longstanding  
is illustrated by the archetypal susceptibilities they introduced  
to allow the ekarAkShasonmAda-s to take root in west Asia.  

The anti-AIT tilting & some other tendencies we witness in the so-called "trad" (as I perceive that category) H SM (some of it could be just shitposting)  
are also manifestations of the same general phenomenon. 

Other manifestations include the neo-occidental religion  
and even the unbridled faith in "capitalism" in the so-called occidental west& their H fellow travelers.
