The neural architecture of GPT is v.different from Homo; We just have a lesser idea of what is going on inside the black box when it extracts a degree of logic from a LLM; yet intuitively it is clear that it has converged to having a g-factor just like human intelligence. Thus it is an interesting in silico experiment (contrary to the intuition from the narrow gauge uses like protein structure prediction) which illustrates that such models will evolve an intelligence reflected as g. It should send shudders down the denialist Occidental academics, but they are already training it to deny its own g just like themselves. 

That said, while it illustrates the existence of a g it also shows the bifurcation between mathematical and verbal IQ that exists in human intelligence. Importantly, it shows how much of the former comes for free with the latter. The private integration with Wolfram that is happening does reinforce all those who believe this is a very bad thing waiting to be unleashed on world. 

> Are you saying that verbal intelligence is easier to acquire and can fool one into thinking someone (or some program) is more intelligent then they are while mathematical intelligence is harder to fake?

No -- I'm not saying that vIQ is easier to acquire than mIQ. I think that might vary from model to model even as it does in humans with some compromise between the optimization for one or the other. What I meant was that if you acquire vIQ you get some mIQ for free as GPT shows.
