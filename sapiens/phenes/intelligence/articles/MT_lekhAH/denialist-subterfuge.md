Many of the strong Occidental denialists of biological determinism seem to tacitly believe in it. Their very denial comes from a fear that wells from deep within -- that it might be true after all! Sometimes when you catch them in their unguarded moments they let the cat out of the bag. 

This type is ironically common in the Occidental academe (including biology!) where they might have above average intelligence. Sometimes they loudly express their disdain for their political opposite: e.g., they would call nAri~Nga-puruSha's partisans as low-IQ & make fun of it. This in itself suggests a tacit acceptance on their part of IQ. Further, they tend to strongly assortatively mate. 

So when you put it together you realize they are merely resorting to subterfuge so that there is no janakopa against their pre-determined gifts. It is even seen in the denialist Lebanese flaneur, who wants a foot in both camps. I've seen a lot if Indian denialists who simply follow their Occidental leads.
