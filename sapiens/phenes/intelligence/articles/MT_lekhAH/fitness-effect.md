People in that above-average IQ range often, in certain real-life contexts, fare worse than those in the lower range as they tend to fool themselves more effectively into erroneous/patently contra-factual beliefs than the latter. The long-term consequences of this on the "smart fraction" is underappreciated relative to the more obvious correlation seen between them and measures of economic productivity like GDP or journal articles. Thus, it might be a dynamic where at some point the smart fraction catches a fatal or in the least destructive memetic infection.
