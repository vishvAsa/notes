title = "Smart fraction"

How the smart fraction (vide Griffe du Lion); physician fraction &scientist fraction scale with mean IQ in the range. I arrived at values for physician fraction &scientist fractions independently by myself but it is notable that a noted IQ worker Gottfredson give similar values.

(I0: the IQ threshold beyond which the area under the distribution curve gives you the IQ fraction required for being part of smart fraction or being a doctor or a scientist)


There are no entirely reliable estimates of Indian IQ. 1 average estimate that has been widely proposed is 85. Assuming a constant s.d of 15 we get the below table; Here "smart fraction" is # of people with IQ>108 which an author going by the name du Lion proposes to be a powerful predictor of national economic performance.  
I use IQ>=137 as the scientist fraction i.e. that fraction of population that can be effective scientists who produce science/math/tech innovations. 

|          | IQ : | Pop       | Smart Frac | Sci. Frac |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| India    | 85   | 1.324e+09 | 82878260   | 348844.2 |
| China    | 103  | 1.379e+09 | 509459608  | 16141606 |
| USA      | 100  | 323100000 | 95928852   | 2203174  |
| Mongolia | 101  | 3027000   | 969757 5 . | 24813 94 |

From different kinds of experience in desh I think that the Indian IQ might actually have a mean of around 94. If we assume this then we get the below table for the same: This would imply we have roughly similar absolute # of sci. frac individuals as the US.

|----------|--------|-----------|------------|----------|
| India    | 94     | 1.324e+09 | 232128903  | 2746106  |
| China    | 103    | 1.379e+09 | 509459608  | 16141606 |
| USA      | 100    | 323100000 | 95928852   | 2203174  |
| Mongolia | 101    | 3027000   | 969757.5   | 24813.94 |


There is no indication thus far that chIna-s have the excess indicated in the table. This might arise from the verbal/quant differentiation in different populations as du Lion speculated. Others have said there might be chIna boosterism in play.

If we take another lower but perhaps more realistic chIna estimate & add a few other countries with their own caveats we get this table

1. mentioned upfront no truly reliable estimates 
2. these are reasonable starting points - not way out. 
3. distribution will remain normal but may be s.d is greater indeed (that may be true of chIna-s too I think). Let's assume a reasonable s.d=17 then we get:
