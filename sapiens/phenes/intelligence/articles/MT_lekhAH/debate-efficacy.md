People think they can convince others through debate; I used to think so too. However, with time I have realized that debate is largely useless. If you have a receptive mind, like Max Planck, then when you get a shredding, like he got from Boltzmann, then you may see the light. Most others are going to be caught with their cherished beliefs, e.g., "no AIT" among many H. They might take it to them with their graves & live in a make believe world like that of shrI Jawaharlal Nehru. 

One may explore the question for oneself & put out the findings in case it helps others on the journey. Beyond that, there is utterly no point debating with those who might have profound foundational issues with respect to how knowledge is apprehended. It is not even interesting & certainly worthwhile cleaning up convoluted contra-evidence claims.
