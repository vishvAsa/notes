Maraviroc -- chemokine receptor CCR5 inhibitor -- rumor has it that some chIna-s might be taking it to enhance their memory & hence IQ.

In the US there are schools known as magnet schools that enrich high IQ kids. Many H along with east Asians put in tremendous effort to get in. What we know of biology clearly tells us that external aids like zapping with magnetism etc cannot do what one needs. For a person with average-above average IQ magnetic stimulation *might* help short term cognitive performance. As for genetic intervention it is going to take a whole generation & a large scale of implantation of modified embryos to see any useful success. That too this is assuming we know to do it right and without unintended negative consequence. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Hence, the most feasible thing in short term in improving nutrition which might go some distance for our country but of course that's not going to let you have a huge smart fraction as Du griffe terms it available for use
