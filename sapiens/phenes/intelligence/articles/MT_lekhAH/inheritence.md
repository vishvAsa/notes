While the Bernoulli clan yielded numerous public figures of differing levels of fame down to the 1900s, the family of Gauss did not yield even one major public figure after him. One of his sons had virtuoso calculation skills inherited from his father but did not achieve anything in math. Another son had geodetic skills but was nothing of note. 

Euler had one son who was a decent mathematician who helped him when he was blind but was not in the same league as his father. There is no evidence I've seen of his clan attaining any prominence thereafter. 

So the Bernoulli was an exception: did they have linked variants at a locus that survived equilibration via recombination for a while?
