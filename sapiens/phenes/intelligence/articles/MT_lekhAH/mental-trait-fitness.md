Biologically a relatively simple criterion could be used for assessing a mental trait:1 which reduces fitness is a "bad" mental trait.  
Of course while simple it's becomes hard to assess in practice due to the background of environment. e.g. some populations in the US are disadvantaged by traits which were once adaptive in the homeland due to changed environment which encompasses dominant cultural strictures.  
Infectious disease could do the same. 

OTH certain clearly maladaptive traits can be lionized by societies:  
In South India a person like ramaNa often titled "maharShi" is seen as positive despite exhibiting maladaptive neuroatypical behavior.+++(5)+++ Mostly H systems had way to channelize neuroaytpical tendencies but lionizing them could prove deleterious on occasions to societies.
