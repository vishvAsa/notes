Over the years, I have wondered if raikva were common or not -- not in the strict sense of hidden vedAnta teachers -- I suspect in that sense raikva-s do exist -- but more generally as hidden knowers deep knowledge. When I was young, I believed that such existed as because I could plainly see poorly known intellectuals whose insights clearly exceeded those who were celebrated in the public. 

After the internet came around, I became less inclined to think that was the case because even if they were introverts they could at least reach a search engine to be known in niche communities. Maybe there is still some truth to that with respect to exactly that -- niche communities. 

However, as time went by I returned to the old view that there are still raikva-s - for the internet & the tyranny & inanity of big tech form hide them from general view and their vAkya-s are not easily grasped by the common crowd. This is probably even more so with the younger generation plagued by with higher incidence of mental illness, which gravitates towards certain types of SM.
