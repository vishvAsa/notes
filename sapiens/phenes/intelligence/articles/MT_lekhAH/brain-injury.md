There are rare but multiple cases of people with brain injury suddenly gaining some new power. One remarkable case we read of was that of a Mexican boy who at age nine was shot  during a robbery through his left hemisphere. For two years he became deaf, mute and paralyzed on his right side. He then regained speech but complete lost his local dialect and despite effort count hard read, write or do math. However, remarkably, he acquired a de novo skill of mechanical assembly, repair and invention. He could make geared bikes and invented a punching bag to simulate the bobbing and weaving of a real opponent. He acquired the ability to copy pictures accurately. He further suddenly acquired the capacity to do magic tricks with "strings and small objects" that others are unable to imitate or figure out!
