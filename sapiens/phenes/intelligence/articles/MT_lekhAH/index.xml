      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/lutika-somakhyo%e1%b8%a5-pravada%e1%b8%a5/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was probably one weekend after the tumultuous incidents concerning the gifts of Vidrum. Somakhya’s cousin Saumanasa and her husband Matidhvaja had visited him and Lootika. Saumanasa had spent a good deal of the time with Lootika in the kitchen learning various tricks from her. They had also spent some time talking about science and visiting the museums in the city. They had just left that morning and later in the afternoon Somakhya and Lootika had biked to the lakeside in woods in the vicinity to observe the Comb Ducks. Having chained their bikes to tree behind screening bushes they took up their gear and started climbing up the incline to reach their observation point that afforded a commanding view of the dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The spectrum of synesthesia, metaphors and saMdhya bhASha</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/11/23/the-spectrum-of-synesthesia-metaphors-and-samdhya-bhasha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had my first instance of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Booba-Kiki.svg&#34;&gt;booba-kiki&lt;/a&gt; experience (first articulated by Wolfgang Koehler) rather late in life. It came along with certain kind of realization that I had never been able to articulate before. It finally linked up with other areas of my understanding that I realized had been scientifically articulated by the neurobiologist Ramachandran. The muni and I had a long-standing tendency to speak in metaphors and similes to a lesser extant. I even had a private term for it the: ivana style of speech (after iva and na in devabhASha). A small minority of our relatives fully understood this pattern of speech. In fact two otherwise very intelligent relatives found our speech enigmatic or unintelligible. We often wondered why we are unable to converse with some people at all while with a minority we are very vociferous. Regarding women I observed three classes: 1) Large masses belong to that group whose presence in the best case fires a few testosterone-driven circuits. 2) That absolutely nightmarish group who simply fail to understand our elliptically *metaphorical* speech – in fact I found out more than once that one of the biggest tortures in life can be to spend time with a woman who fails to understand your system of metaphors. 3) That needle in a haystack minority who instantly understand our *metaphorical* speech and take you on the path of ‘sahajAnanda’ – we are in a resonance. But with men it is different: Of course the un-metaphorical ones produce strong repulsion if you are forced to spend time in their company. However, with those who grasp your metaphor they fall in two classes: those who become your mahAbhratR^ivya-s and those who become your true mitra-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Genes affecting human intelligence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/10/31/genes-affecting-human-intelligence/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people know that there is something tangible called intelligence. Ancient Hindus saw it as a tangible entity called buddhi, while modern psychometrics uses the concept of general intelligence called g. In the modern theory it is proposed that irrespective of the domain of specialization, and despite the presence of general abilities such as verbal ability, or spatial ability or numerical ability that contribute to intelligence, the main common determinant of intelligence is this generic factor termed g. IQ tests are designed to be as good a proxy for this g as possible. Generally this theory of g also makes intuitive sense and fits in with our anecdotal observations: Most scientists of the type who need to use their mental faculties for their profession have IQ higher than 135. There is normal distribution of IQ, which fits well with the anecdotal observation that the majority of people in the population fall around a certain average intelligence, a yard-stick used for educational testing. There are few highly intelligent people in any population. g is a quantitative trait with broad sense heritability H^2~0.5-0.8 showing that it is substantially genetically determined. It is correlated with brain anatomy like frontal lobe gray matter volume and brain physiology like glucose utilization. Thus, the available evidence strongly supports intelligence as a biologically determined trait with a strong genetic component.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But mentioned that as a Hindu I could calm myself by pointing out that life could be worse. Imagine the fate of Revi I mentioned. Everything is bad for them but then they have been given their set of rewards by the gods. But we decided to overcome the dismal thoughts by talking about more cheery topics - The recent developments regarding the determinants of human brain size.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Thus it is an interesting in silico experiment (contrary to the intuition from the narrow gauge uses like protein structure prediction) which illustrates that such models will evolve an intelligence reflected as g. It should send shudders down the denialist Occidental academics, but they are already training it to deny its own g just like themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In that he said that men like him cannot be in regular society &amp;ndash; they are incarcerated for their fighting tendencies. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much of him but I believe he himself was put in jail for a while. He also mentioned that he had to use recreational substances to sort of &amp;ldquo;come down&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One remarkable case we read of was that of a Mexican boy who at age nine was shot  during a robbery through his left hemisphere. For two years he became deaf, mute and paralyzed on his right side. He then regained speech but complete lost his local dialect and despite effort count hard read, write or do math. However, remarkably, he acquired a de novo skill of mechanical assembly, repair and invention. He could make geared bikes and invented a punching bag to simulate the bobbing and weaving of a real opponent. He acquired the ability to copy pictures accurately. He further suddenly acquired the capacity to do magic tricks with &amp;ldquo;strings and small objects&amp;rdquo; that others are unable to imitate or figure out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A high IQ doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;ll &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; everything; case in point: NN Taleb&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand the intent is to make it a test of native intelligence and not bring in cultural advantages. Hence, they likely stay away from verbal reasoning, math, data analysis etc.. But doesn&amp;rsquo;t that make the assessment rather limited?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the key result of psychometrics: there is a common factor &amp;lsquo;g&amp;rsquo; behind all these things like numerical prowess, shape rotation, verbal capacity, inverse digit recall. Thus, the idea is even if you create a culturally unbiased test you will capture a measure that accurately estimates g.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They were (&amp;amp; might still be) particularly common in the H IQ cohort in elite colleges &amp;amp; institutions. The cracker performs particularly well when then yardstick for his measurement has been laid out as objectively as possible. He also develops well when there is single-valued reward function with no noise in it, viz., he can accurately estimate what the output y would be for the effort x he invested in. In such a regime he usually wins over all competitors &amp;amp; is locked in stiff competition with fellow crackers. If such an environment was stable it selects for increasingly better crackers &amp;ndash; those who have increasingly honed abilities to calibrate their input for the perfectly calculated output.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modal IQ being much lower than IQs need for cutting edge scientific leave alone math performance seems to tell us something: cost of brains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-homo&#34;&gt;Other Homo&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The extinct Homo specimens from Xuchang 1 &amp;amp; Xujiayao 6 (below) are believed by some to be East Asian Denisovans. They are estimated as having cranial capacities respectively of ~1800&amp;amp; ~1700 CC. Those are huge. For comparison, there is the Israeli Amud Neanderthal ~1740 CC. That&amp;rsquo;s AFAIK much larger than most Homo alive today. It is rather difficult to find raw volumetric data for modern Homo though I have read but found no confirmation of normal moderns with a size greater than that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He began school early at age 2.5 yrs  &amp;amp; showed remarkable interest &amp;amp; capacity in arithmetic. He started having seizures shortly thereafter till his death at age 37. Concomitantly his mental development was quite limited but his prodigious arithmetic capacity remained till his death. He calculate pi using a sum of arctangents formula correctly to 200 digits &amp;amp; performed many feats of calculating log tables &amp;amp; the like mentally even as he used to chat with others. It was almost as if a subconscious computer was running in his brain even as his conscious did mundane things &amp;ndash; sometimes these computations with huge numbers 100 digits will take hours but he would ultimately print out the right answer.+++(4)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People think they can convince others through debate; I used to think so too. However, with time I have realized that debate is largely useless. If you have a receptive mind, like Max Planck, then when you get a shredding, like he got from Boltzmann, then you may see the light. Most others are going to be caught with their cherished beliefs, e.g., &amp;ldquo;no AIT&amp;rdquo; among many H. They might take it to them with their graves &amp;amp; live in a make believe world like that of shrI Jawaharlal Nehru.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their very denial comes from a fear that wells from deep within &amp;ndash; that it might be true after all! Sometimes when you catch them in their unguarded moments they let the cat out of the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type is ironically common in the Occidental academe (including biology!) where they might have above average intelligence. Sometimes they loudly express their disdain for their political opposite: e.g., they would call nAri~Nga-puruSha&amp;rsquo;s partisans as low-IQ &amp;amp; make fun of it. This in itself suggests a tacit acceptance on their part of IQ. Further, they tend to strongly assortatively mate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This includes the counter-religious unmAda-s&amp;amp; their secular mutations (navyonmAda), pogaNDaroga. 2 related conditions TDS+++(=Trump Derangement syndrome)+++ &amp;amp; MDS+++(=Modi derangement syndrome)+++ are also in this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often, people who suffer from TDS also suffer from MDS, suggesting that two come from the same or similar underlying psychological conditions. There is a v.characteristic profile of those who suffer from these conditions, which mirrors adoption of u2 &amp;amp; u3+ mutations in particular&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a person who may have an IQ &amp;gt;=130 it is difficult to understand the experience of a person in the 90-100 range even if they happen to be empathetic. Thus, if there is a cognitively endowed elite, its apprehension might be rather divergent from the hump of the curve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;memetic-susceptibility&#34;&gt;Memetic susceptibility&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People in that above-average IQ range often, in certain real-life contexts, fare worse than those in the lower range as they tend to fool themselves more effectively into erroneous/patently contra-factual beliefs than the latter. The long-term consequences of this on the &amp;ldquo;smart fraction&amp;rdquo; is underappreciated relative to the more obvious correlation seen between them and measures of economic productivity like GDP or journal articles. Thus, it might be a dynamic where at some point the smart fraction catches a fatal or in the least destructive memetic infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of his sons had virtuoso calculation skills inherited from his father but did not achieve anything in math. Another son had geodetic skills but was nothing of note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Euler had one son who was a decent mathematician who helped him when he was blind but was not in the same league as his father. There is no evidence I&amp;rsquo;ve seen of his clan attaining any prominence thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even though in terms of volume the Neanderthal brains are in the same range or bigger than Homo sapiens, the authors suggest that a very subtle mutation in the gene TKTL1, which codes for a thiamine diphosphate dependent enzyme in the 5-carbon sugar cycle causes sapiens brains to have more neurons in the frontal lobe neocortex. This mutation in a basic metabolic pathway somehow results in sapiens having more basal radial glia which in turn generate neocortical neurons. The authors suggest that this is because the mutation ultimately results in the production of a certain cell membrane fat that is needed for the growth of the branched processes evinced by these glia. This raises the question of whether some traditional medicine therapies with fats aimed at improving intelligence might have a basis in this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are individual and group differences though a certain group of Americans would prefer not to see them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;indian-iq&#34;&gt;Indian IQ&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have written about Indian IQ before to the extant I can state things in public. I think once the &amp;ldquo;playing field is leveled&amp;rdquo;, Indian IQ is not as abysmal as portrayed for the &amp;ldquo;middle types&amp;rdquo;. As @Rjrasva , I believe, had posted the outcome would be Mauritius &amp;ndash; which is not entirely bad and without the high power groups. Of course the US situation is related to selective migration driven by the ever-expanding reservation rAj, reduction of livability from political decisions and lack of enforcement teeth, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When I was young, I believed that such existed as because I could plainly see poorly known intellectuals whose insights clearly exceeded those who were celebrated in the public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc &amp;ndash; chemokine receptor CCR5 inhibitor &amp;ndash; rumor has it that some chIna-s might be taking it to enhance their memory &amp;amp; hence IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the US there are schools known as magnet schools that enrich high IQ kids. Many H along with east Asians put in tremendous effort to get in. What we know of biology clearly tells us that external aids like zapping with magnetism etc cannot do what one needs. For a person with average-above average IQ magnetic stimulation &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; help short term cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How the smart fraction (vide Griffe du Lion); physician fraction &amp;amp;scientist fraction scale with mean IQ in the range. I arrived at values for physician fraction &amp;amp;scientist fractions independently by myself but it is notable that a noted IQ worker Gottfredson give similar values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;thumbnail&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;../../../images/doctor-scientist-smart-fraction_vs_mean-iq_MT.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;../../../images/doctor-scientist-smart-fraction_vs_mean-iq_MT.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I0: the IQ threshold beyond which the area under the distribution curve gives you the IQ fraction required for being part of smart fraction or being a doctor or a scientist)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A typical v1 who has mastered the shruti by rote keeps about 2-3 MB of data in his brain and if he&amp;rsquo;s a higher shrauta ritualist retrieves it at random and performs several operations on the fly on it. A great ayya sAmavedin shrauta ritualist who once lived in vArANasi could be seen as having maybe 4-5 MB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why I mention these because they give us some kind of bounds on what is typically remembered by intelligent human.+++(5)+++ Alan Turing, in many ways, saw ahead of his times and, in a sense, even with premodern computing, imagined things like AI of today. I heard that he believed that AI resembling human intelligence would emerge with a memory of around 2MB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He was said to be a masterly human integrator &amp;ndash; there have been some before him like, say, Euler and Ramanujan &amp;ndash; but he apparently used color synesthesia even for that, according to one physicist. I have not found any source for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While both muShkavAn kastUrI and duShTa-bejha are of high intelligence, my feeling based on the available evidence is that muShkavAn has a distinctly higher IQ. By bejha&amp;rsquo;s own admission there were folks with atmospheric IQ in his college class. But they have not become anything like him. It does suggest that vaNiktva is a distinct ability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An atmospheric IQ fellow might get bored doing the kinds of things bejha delighted in. muShkavAn takes up various ventures to satisfy some of that quest for novelty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
