A high IQ doesn't mean you'll "get" everything; case in point: NN Taleb

> I understand the intent is to make it a test of native intelligence and not bring in cultural advantages. Hence, they likely stay away from verbal reasoning, math, data analysis etc.. But doesn't that make the assessment rather limited?

That's the key result of psychometrics: there is a common factor 'g' behind all these things like numerical prowess, shape rotation, verbal capacity, inverse digit recall. Thus, the idea is even if you create a culturally unbiased test you will capture a measure that accurately estimates g. 

Empirically we know that verbal IQ & numerical IQ are not perfectly correlated but the angle between those vectors is small. Hence, a proxy that measures something correlated with both is a decent psychometric probe.

> Taleb's view of IQ is one of disdain. Is there any other measure which can show the differing levels of cognition?

Taleb is totally wrong on that one. IQ is a useful measure but it is not perfect because it has two vectors verbal & mathematical that are not perfectly aligned.
