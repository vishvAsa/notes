A high IQ doesn't mean you'll "get" everything; case in point: NN Taleb

> I understand the intent is to make it a test of native intelligence and not bring in cultural advantages. Hence, they likely stay away from verbal reasoning, math, data analysis etc.. But doesn't that make the assessment rather limited?

That's the key result of psychometrics: there is a common factor 'g' behind all these things like numerical prowess, shape rotation, verbal capacity, inverse digit recall. Thus, the idea is even if you create a culturally unbiased test you will capture a measure that accurately estimates g. 

Empirically we know that verbal IQ & numerical IQ are not perfectly correlated but the angle between those vectors is small. Hence, a proxy that measures something correlated with both is a decent psychometric probe.

> Taleb's view of IQ is one of disdain. Is there any other measure which can show the differing levels of cognition?

Taleb is totally wrong on that one. IQ is a useful measure but it is not perfect because it has two vectors verbal & mathematical that are not perfectly aligned.

## Denialism

And then there are some mathematicians who might be so enthralled by the fat "uropathology" of the Cauchy distribution that they might forget about the good old normal distribution of everyday experience

That IQ is not everything becomes rather apparent  
when you have high IQ traders and math teachers deny basics of genetics.  
That shows that being smart  
does not necessarily mean you will "get" some relatively simple things.  

The bright side of this is  
even if you do not have the meteoric IQ of an esteemed trader or a math professor  
you might still be able to make some good contribution to knowledge for,  
who knows, they might have missed something that you can quite easily see and apprehend.


There something really disgusting  
about the high IQ occidental academics denying the individual gradation in human intelligence:  

first, they probably spend their time in the company of rarified intellect  
hardly bothering to think about  
what life might be for the plebian.  
Then they claim that  
such gradation in intelligence is non-existent  
implying that the plebian did not scale the heights they did  
probably because they did not do the hard work. 

Second, they sell hopes which might be as false as telling your kid  
that he might become Usain Bolt if only just kept running.  
Of course we then have the Nature magazine then allow pontification on its platform  
that Kenyans are probably not doing those marathon records due to a genomic basis.  
Well just keep running you may reach Kenya after all.
 

these worthless occidental academics really need to come back to their plush offices  
after getting a bit dirty in the real world after spending time with some plebians.  
It will do them and the world some good

In case you thought I was kidding this is actually a quote from something approvingly published by the Nature magazine. We knew the magazine did its share of harm to science but this...

> Evans zooms in on two focal points of racial stereotypes: sport and intelligence. His section on the success of Kenyan marathon runners in global contests is brilliant: it demolishes the idea of genetic explanations for any region's sporting achievements. Some have speculated that Kenyans might have, on average, longer, thinner legs than other people, or differences in heart and muscle function.  
> Evans notes, however, that we don't make such generalizations about white British athletes when they do disproportionately well in global athletics.  
> Such claims for athletic prowess are lazy biological essentialism, heavily doped with racism.

> It appears that they want to use their offices to deny the obvious for things like athletic differences are the most obvious signal that the emperor's genitalia are indeed visible
