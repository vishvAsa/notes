I heard that Richard Feynman had color synesthesia and apparently saw terms of equations in color and could simply get all the same colors together. He was said to be a masterly human integrator -- there have been some before him like, say, Euler and Ramanujan -- but he apparently used color synesthesia even for that, according to one physicist. I have not found any source for the latter.

I wonder if Ramanujan, too, had some kind of synesthesia that people have misinterpreted in the readings of his statements of seeing answers to problems without a "proof". The number of partitions formula hints at one such.

Einstein is said to have had some kind of touch synesthesia and to have literally felt the "fabric of space-time" that allowed him to comprehend it better. I personally believe there is something like "tattvAvesha"- a deep understanding of systems that are symbolically represented as 1D stringsâ€”where one goes from 1D to a 3D understanding with a "feel" for them. This may be akin to how Einstein was able to feel space-time from linearly written tensor symbols.

The Canadian preta intellectual made a statement, something like "A perception is thought that acquires a feel to it. You are not just thinking about it but are now able to feel it." That is perhaps a germ of a process that expands in the more endowed folks like Einstein.
