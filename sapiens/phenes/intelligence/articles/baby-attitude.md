UofChicago psychologist Dan Freedman found half a century ago that East Asian & Native American babies were calmer than Caucasian & African ones. This finding is consistent w my empirical analysis of Inuit/Polar worker data paper, neuroimaging scans, & Piffer's genomic studies. This is more robust & supported by multidisciplinary evidence than 99% of social psych theories but which university these days would teach this?
