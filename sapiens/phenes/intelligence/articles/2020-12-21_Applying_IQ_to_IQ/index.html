Applying IQ to IQ
Thinking Man Homo sapiens are very smart. They are very smart because they have large brains. This is not controversial. In relation to our body size, humans have bulging craniums housing large brains. About 20% of our caloric intake feeds our brain when we’re resting even though it’s only 2% of our body weight.&#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43; It’s a calorically expensive organ.
We were not always so large-brained. The fossils make it clear even to a non-specialist. Our brains began to grow several million years ago. There are many theories about why this might be, but the result is clearly that we have an extremely energetically expensive organ. So it must be useful. Evolution’s rule of thumb is “use it or lose it” if it’s imposing a cost.&#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43; Just ask snakes where their legs are.&#43;&#43;&#43;(5)&#43;&#43;&#43;">

<p>Applying IQ to IQ</p>
<h2 id="thinking-man">Thinking Man</h2>
<p>Homo sapiens are very smart. They are very smart because they have large
brains. This is not controversial. In relation to our body size, humans
have bulging craniums housing large brains. About 20% of our caloric
intake feeds our brain when we’re resting even though it’s only 2% of
our body weight.+++(5)+++ It’s a calorically expensive organ.</p>
<p>We were not always so large-brained. The fossils make it clear even to a
non-specialist. Our brains began to grow several million years ago.
There are many theories about why this might be, but the result is
clearly that we have an extremely energetically expensive organ. So it
must be useful. Evolution’s rule of thumb is “use it or lose it” if it’s
imposing a cost.+++(5)+++ Just ask snakes where their legs are.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>But all good things come to an end. Around 200,000 years ago the growth
of our brains leveled off, probably due to biological constraints. The
large head of the human fetus runs up against the limits of the
mechanics of childbirth. Human infants are already born notably early in
relation to their development. Natural selection tends to run into
obstacles if it keeps being pushed in a single direction.+++(5)+++ Chickens grown
huge for their meat eventually become infertile.+++(5)+++ And H. sapiens and its
brain found its barrier 200,000 years ago. In fact, the largest brained
humans seem to have lived during the Ice Age, <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/the-human-brain-has-been-getting-smaller-since-the-stone-age">not
today</a>.+++(5)+++
Since the transition to farming our brains have been shrinking.</p>
<h2 id="thinking-about-what">Thinking about what?</h2>
<p>The primary use of the brain is to cogitate. To think. But there are
many ways to think about thinking. That’s why cognitive science and
psychology are expansive disciplines. For example, there are a set of
human competencies that derive from “hard-wired” and “innate” aptitudes.
The human abilities to recognize faces, or throw a stone, are not purely
environmentally learned skills. We are not born being able to recognize
faces or throw stones. But, we learn to do these things very naturally
and easily. Similarly, humans have a facility with spoken language which
is clearly based on something peculiar about our cognitive hardware.+++(4)+++ Our
brains. Again, we are not born speaking. Rather, it is something we are
primed to acquire and learn easily due to the tools we are born with.+++(4)+++
Experiments with chimpanzees show that though they can take steps toward
some vocabulary and syntax, even the youngest human toddlers are far
superior in their linguistic abilities.+++(4)+++ We’re born that way.</p>
<p>Core competencies like language, facial recognition, and social
intelligence are the mental characteristics that bind us and define us.+++(4)+++
All humans have language. Face blindness, the inability to recognize
faces in a gestalt manner, is found in only a minority of humans. It is
a genetic condition, as it runs in families. Very low social
intelligence is often classified as “autism.”+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Cultural innovations such as spears and swords spread rapidly and
universally because the human ability to manipulate tools is universal.+++(4)+++
We may not have an instinct to grasp a spear, but we can learn how to do
so naturally and without great difficulty.</p>
<p>This is not the case with all tasks. Most humans have difficulty
understanding algebraic topology.+++(4)+++</p>
<h2 id="the-bright">The Bright</h2>
<p>But there are also differences between people. Consider the polymath
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>. A
basis for the character of Dr. Strangelove, von Neumann was one of the
most brilliant individuals of the 20th century. The theoretical
physicist Edward Teller said of von Neumann that he “would carry on a
conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as
equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he
talked to the rest of us.”+++(4)+++ The founder of game theory, Oskar
Morgenstern, has spoken of how his collaboration with von Neumann was
incredibly fruitful for him, but for the latter game theory was a
marginal contribution in relation to his broader oeuvre. It was said von
Neumann derived proofs in an almost casual and instinctive manner that
floored his intellectual contemporaries.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>How do we explain von Neumann? Is such a mind the end of human
evolutionary development?</p>
<p>No. He had one child, and today he has two grandchildren.+++(4)+++ The genes
which led to the brilliance of von Neumann’s mind did not redound to his
reproductive success, the only scoreboard in the game of evolution.</p>
<h2 id="general-intelligence">General Intelligence</h2>
<p>Von Neumann lived to the age of 53. Here are some of the fields he
contributed to: set theory, ergodic theory, operator theory, measure
theory, lattice theory, von Neumann entropy, quantum mutual information,
density matrix, von Neumann measurement scheme, quantum logic, game
theory, mathematical economics, linear programming, mathematical
statistics, fluid dynamics, cellular automata, DNA and the universal
constructor. He was arguably the apotheosis of “general intelligence,”
the ability to move fluidly between disciplines due to an innate mastery
of abstraction and universal principles.+++(4)+++ In a stone-age society, someone
of von Neumann’s caliber may have been unrecognized. His exceptional
talents would not have found an expression in the world of flint blades.
But embedded within a modern cultural matrix which leveraged his skills
he became a supernova of intellectual creativity. Like Archimedes moving
the earth with a lever, culture and civilization are the frameworks in
which geniuses of von Neumann’s caliber can shine. Alone on an island,
they are stranded with their thoughts, but poised in the matrix of
civilization- their explosions of brilliance shed a discernible light on
all.</p>
<p>But obviously, there is a spectrum between von Neuman and the typical
human. The human race is not divided between von Neumann and the rest of
us. The ability to engage in deep and complex abstraction varies greatly
amongst humans, along a normal distribution. The two giants of
20th-century mathematical population genetics are R. A. Fisher and
Sewall Wright. Both were brilliant individuals who made incredible
contributions to evolutionary biology. But Fisher was the more general
thinker, making contributions to thermodynamics and statistics in
addition to biology. Wright’s contributions to science were more
domain-specific, and his mathematical skills generally understood to be
of lesser caliber (Fisher trained formally as a child and young man in
mathematics, while Wright trained himself as an adult).</p>
<p>Fisher was reputed to be personally rather unpleasant, and his extreme
myopia as a child resulted in his need to make recourse to mental
visualization of geometric problems due to his inability to see the
chalkboard.+++(5)+++ Despite his mental brilliance, there is no suggestion that
he was a genetic specimen of superiority. Outside of the context of late
Victorian and early Edwardian England, it is likely that the young
Fisher would be on the margins in the game of life.+++(4)+++ General intelligence
in abstractions only matters in a society of specialization, where the
division of labor continually deploys countless busy little platoons,
each bustling about their abstruse tasks.+++(4)+++ In a world where everyone is a
farmer or hunter Fisher would have struggled.</p>
<p>g = f(verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory, processing speed)</p>
<h2 id="the-common-factor">The common factor</h2>
<p>In the early 20th century psychologists noticed that there was a
correlation in performance across mental aptitude tests. Like any
correlation this was imperfect, but the reality is that if you do very
well or very poorly on mental aptitude tests, this pattern tends to
reoccur across a series of tests. Those who do well on undergraduate
admissions standardized tests tend to do well on graduate admissions
standardized tests. Those who do poorly on one type of test tend to do
poorly on another type.+++(4)+++ This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)">general intelligence
factor</a>, a
statistical construct that summarizes the positive correlation among
standardized tests.+++(4)+++ It is what we colloquially refer to as the
“intelligence quotient” or IQ.</p>
<p>This should not be surprising. There are many people who are athletic
and excel at most any sport they try. It turns out that substantial
muscle mass, fast reaction times, and a high level of coordination are
useful across sports.+++(4)+++ This applies even at the highest levels. There are
many athletes who are recruited for multiple professional sports
leagues, and their choices are dictated often by utilitarian
considerations (e.g., baseball careers tend to be much longer than
football careers due to the higher rate of injury in the latter).
Conversely, there are many individuals who do poorly at sports in
general, due to low muscle mass and lack of coordination.</p>
<p>Because general intelligence does not manifest physically in the same
manner that a fit physique does, it is often assumed that intelligence
is purely a matter of internal effort.+++(4)+++ You can run a 100-yard dash with
your time instantly displayed for every spectator to see. How well
someone does on a two-hour pencil and paper test is at some remove from
our immediate perception.+++(4)+++ Sometimes there is the expectation that if you
work long enough you can derive a novel mathematical proof. Would we ask
the same of an average height and athleticism person when it comes to
dunking a basketball? Even the most brilliant math majors often fail to
solve any questions for the elite collegiate Putnam competition.+++(5)+++ There
are limits to how far effort can take you.</p>
<h2 id="iq-matters">IQ matters</h2>
<p>General intelligence is one of the most predictive psychological
measures in existence. The chestnut of wisdom that ability to test well
measures how well you take a test is true but trivial. The implication
that test measurement does not correlate with other aspects of
performance is manifestly false. Those with higher measured IQs have
higher incomes, greater educational attainment, and lower crime rates
(this remains true among siblings who differ in IQ).+++(5)+++ This is well known
within psychological science, but for various reasons has been obscured
and downplayed by broader American culture.</p>
<p>As with the athletically gifted, the differences in outcomes is most
obvious in those who are intellectually gifted at a young age. The chart
below shows the outcomes of 259 children identified as very gifted in
their early teens on the SAT:</p>
<figure class="">

    </a>

    

</figure>
<p>One out of thirteen of these extremely bright children became tenured
professors. One out of thirty-three wrote a book. Nearly half obtained
doctorates.+++(4)+++ These are not average kids who simply “test well.” There is
luck in life, but the die is loaded.+++(5)+++ Very high intelligence is no
guarantee of exceptional achievement, but it clearly changes the
probabilities.</p>
<p>The correlations for IQ and socially relevant variables can be quite
modest. For example, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.683.1926&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">some
studies</a>
find correlations between childhood IQ and income as an adult to be
0.40.+++(4)+++ One interpretation of this is that “IQ doesn’t matter,” after all,
there are many well-off people with lower IQs and many poor people with
higher IQs. Most of us know cases like this, so intuitively the idea
that IQ matters such a great deal in life outcomes strikes many as
implausible. There are many ways to become well-off. And, no matter your
IQ, if you are a disagreeable person with low conscientiousness your
chance of success is often quite low.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>And as with athletics, hard work can get you only so far as you move up
the ladder of achievement. At 5’5 Sarah Palin has talked about how she
was a successful high school basketball player not due to any particular
talent. Rather, she just worked very hard. But that only got her so far.
At each stage the athletes are more unique and exceptional physical
specimens, endowed with both physical talents and harder-to-define
cognitive abilities maximizing coordination and skill. There are many
tall human beings, but very few can be elite basketball players, because
these athletes combine great size with a grace and coordination that
tall humans often lack.+++(4)+++ Michael Jordan’s fluid movements were not
typical for a man of 6’6.+++(4)+++ In this, he exceeded even his peers in the
NBA, who often seemed ungainly next to “His Airness.”</p>
<p>It is quite plausible that one can obtain a university degree through
conscientiousness despite modest cognitive aptitudes.+++(5)+++ There are many
such individuals. But who is going to win a Fields Medal in mathematics,
which recognizes the most brilliant young minds? A high IQ is not
sufficient in this case. Not at all. But it is probably necessary.+++(4)+++</p>
<h2 id="testing-has-been-with-us-for-2000-years">Testing has been with us for 2,000 years</h2>
<p>In various forms, standardized testing has been with us for 2,000 years.
During the Han Dynasty a group of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examination#Han_dynasty">bureaucrats</a>
began to undergo examinations to vet their competency. This system of
examinations became more formalized and elaborated in later dynasties.
The rationale for these examinations was that those who rule should be
inculcated in timeless values and exhibit intellectual abilities. While
China’s gentry mastered the classics to obtain high office, the West’s
elite saw education mostly as a status marker and an avenue to elite
cohesion.+++(4)+++ Roman aristocrats like Quintus Aurelius Symmachus peppered
their letters with literary allusions to mark themselves as noble-born.+++(4)+++
The fall of Rome corresponded with the decline in the prestige of elite
education, and the rise of a purely hereditary nobility, aided by the
Christian Church.+++(5)+++ They ruled at the point of a sword and their
legitimacy was their lineage.</p>
<p>But the age of aristocracy ended in Europe, and a new egalitarian ethos
required ways to identify those with talent but no connections or
pedigree. Intelligence testing
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.482.4805&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">appeared</a>
in modern Europe as a way in which to identify talented individuals born
outside of the elite. Today the French elite is selected in large part
through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_%C3%A9cole#:~:text=Grandes%20%C3%A9coles%20chiefly%20admit%20students,dedicated%20preparatory%20classes%20for%20admission.">admissions
tests</a>
to the grandes écoles.+++(5)+++ While Prince Charles attended Cambridge, his son
William, who was reputedly academically stronger than his father,
attended the less prestigious University of St. Andrews. Though
universities remain bastions of the elite, deploying standardized
testing frameworks usually slows the stream of connected but technically
underqualified elites jumping the queue.+++(4)+++ George W. Bush went to Yale.
His younger, more intelligent, brother Jeb attended the University of
Texas in Austin.+++(4)+++ The older Bush was admitted before the meritocratic
revolution in admissions which opened up Yale to many more outside of
the old WASP ascendancy.</p>
<p>The long Chinese history of testing prefigures many of the arguments we
have today about intelligence and how to measure it. Because the
learning necessary to sit for the examination required leisure, elite
lineages often invested in bright young men, subsidizing their schooling
and promoting them forward. Sometimes whole lineages would support a
promising candidate.+++(4)+++ This caused great distress when failure was the
ultimate outcome. In the 19th century the failed candidate Hong Xiuquan
went insane, and eventually became the prophet who triggered the Taiping
Rebellion in which millions died. Remember, Hong’s failure squandered
years of collective investment of resources by his whole extended
family. Obviously the resources necessary to study mean that the
privileged would be at an advantage, but the reality is that even among
the privileged, to even be allowed to sit for the examination one had to
have some talent.+++(4)+++ Additionally, throughout Chinese history, there were
instances of men of very modest means rising to eminence on account of
their pure incandescent brilliance.+++(4)+++ In a similar manner, the Indian
genius Srinivasa Ramanujan lacked resources and access to the latest
books, so he re-derived portions of Western mathematics. His Cambridge
mentors immediately recognized his brilliance and sponsored his research
fellowship.</p>
<p>When examinations fell out of favor, as occurred during the Eastern Han,
the Tang, and the Yuan, the consequences were inevitable. A coterie of
great families, or ruling castes, came to dominate the administration,
and unattached youth of talent were excluded and marginalized.+++(4)+++ The
testing regime was uniformly disliked by the aristocrats because they
already had power, connections, and polish.+++(4)+++ They perceived in themselves
the right to rule. They required no test to validate their self-worth.
For those born to rule, the memorization of ancient texts and the
drafting of learned essays is tedious. But to the bright but
unconnected, mental gymnastics are a chance to demonstrate their
worthiness.</p>
<p>Sometimes the historical precedents are eerie. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08138BMWY/geneexpressio-20">The Age of Confucian
Rule</a>
recorded that there was a tacit understanding that there would be a
ceiling on the number of officials who came out of Fujian.+++(4)+++ This
southeastern coastal province brimmed with scholarly activity during
this period, and it sent far too many candidates through the examination
system for ruling elite comfort. The Song engaged in what we would call
affirmative action to allow for the representation of Northern officials
within the bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-privilege">The return of privilege</h2>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has now presented some opportunities to remove
testing from American life. One of the major-specific reasons cited is
long-term racial
<a href="https://www.jbhe.com/2015/09/the-growing-racial-gap-in-sat-scores/">discrepancies</a>
in average score. The more general objection is that standardized
testing favors the privileged due to the cost of the tests, as well as
the reality that those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to be
more well prepared to take these tests. This is almost certainly true
<a href="https://insideschools.org/news-&amp;-views/more-bangladeshi-students-test-into-elite-schools">on some
level</a>,
though the success of the children of poor Bangladeshi immigrants in New
York City shows the meritocratic path that testing can provide.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Tests are imperfect. But what is the alternative? Over the past few
years graduate schools have been removing the
<a href="https://oitecareersblog.od.nih.gov/2020/09/28/grexit-grad-schools-dropping-gre-requirement/">GRE</a>
as a requirement for admission. What will the consequence be? If the
history of China is any guide, those with connections and pedigree will
benefit. Without a hard-to-fake entrance exam, recommendations from
those you trust will loom large again.+++(4)+++ The abolition of the GRE will be
a back door through which the “letter of introduction” returns. Who will
be hurt by this? Who will benefit? There are many answers here, but one
thing seems obvious: those without connections will suffer.
International students. Those from working-class backgrounds.
Non-traditional older students trying to turn their life around with the
benefit of hindsight. When academics rely on networks of those they
already know, the circle of inclusion will begin to narrow. Ironically,
attempts to “foster inclusion” by removing standardized testing will
inevitably constrict the space of those included.+++(4)+++</p>
<h2 id="genes-iq-and-family">Genes, IQ, and Family</h2>
<p>Depending on the study IQ is at least 50% heritable.+++(5)+++ That means that
half the variation in IQ in the population is due to variation in genes.
Through genomics, scientists are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6393768/">now
accounting</a> for
this through DNA as well as correlations across relatives. Pure <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/desc.12925">genetic
predictors</a>
of IQ can now explain life outcomes like how many years of education you
complete. Over the next few years the genetic predictors are likely to
get better, and the relationship between class, genetics, and education
will become clearer. What the genetic results tell us is that there are
children with a likely aptitude who nevertheless forgo university due to
their class deprivation.+++(4)+++ Conversely, there are well-off children without
aptitude who do go to university.</p>
<p>Genetics and IQ are separate topics and domains, but due to the
heritable component of intelligence, they are often connected. The
conflation of genetics and IQ makes the latter far more radioactive. If
the consequence of this conflation is that both intelligence and
achievement testing disappear, then the outcomes may surprise people.
Human judgment matters, but cold and cool rules are better at sorting
competent from incompetent.</p>

<h2 id="the-wests-last-test">The West’s Last Test</h2>
<p>In a strange denouement, the professional-managerial class of the United
States, itself sorted through grades and standardized tests, has turned
against these sorting tools of the institutions which provide them
prestige and power. When scientists assert that the GRE does not predict
success, they magically forget the ability of range restriction to
constrain the predictive power of a variable. Believe it or not, taller
basketball players are not the best basketball players in the NBA.
That’s because NBA players are all already tall, more or less.+++(5)+++ The
abolition of the GRE and marginalization of the SAT, amount to a massive
natural experiment. These experiments are predicated on the idea that
standardized testing is useless. No matter that in various forms this
method has been around for 2,000 years, and we have evidence of the
benefits and deficiencies of testing in the historical record. <strong>Close
your eyes and believe.</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese and other Asian nations continue to use
standardized tests as a mechanism for admission and sorting. This does
not guarantee better leaders necessarily, but it does mean that members
of the professional class have all gone through the same mechanism of
selection, and one which is relatively insulated from the impact of
pedigree and connection, which otherwise loom large in many Asian
societies. The fact of the importance of connections means that Asians
understand the value and power of the “big test” which is blind to all
the other “holistic” factors, which often smuggle privilege in through
the back door.</p>
<p>The next generation will be a test. Will America turn away from
intelligence and aptitude testing to unleash untapped capital? Or will
our society’s meliorist impulses only usher in a new era of cronyism and
favoritism? History teaches us to anticipate the latter. But you never
know until you run the experiment.</p>
