      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: LovelyIris_&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Attention is to women what sex is to men. A woman who receives a lot of attention but doesn&amp;rsquo;t sleep around is akin to a man who sleeps around but barely invests. Both are winners, so to speak. Men who give away attention freely and women who sleep around freely are losers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why men are repulsed by sluts and women are repulsed by simps. Simps and sluts exhibit low-value behaviour. They will happily take advantage of them though, but will never respect them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To many women, accountability and responsibility feels like oppression. If you tell most women to avoid being outside at night in deserted places, chances are you’re going to be called a sexist. No, it’s just called taking responsibility for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Men’s aggression and violence towards women is never their fault, but it is their responsibility to protect themselves from it. I don’t trust anyone who tells young girls to make themselves more vulnerable under some misguided notion of empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
