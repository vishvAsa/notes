A remarkable case of sexual parasitism in an ant to clonally maintain a male from a different species to produce hybrid workers. Here, the male ant from a different species is produced by the queen by having its nuclear genome replace the queen's haploid genome in the egg. This male is thus maintained in the population independently of its original species. When this cloned male from the different species mates with the queen, it produces workers. 

## Hybrid vigor
It seems to have emerged from the more widespread sexual parasitism in ants, where queens mate with both males of their own species and a different species. The matings with the same species produce new queens. 

It is like dharmashAstra authors saw pratiloma pairings producing various castes. The matings with a different species produce the worker castes. This is likely a mechanism to produce workers with greater hybrid vigor. 

## haplodiploidy
This, together with haplodiploidy, seems to have fixed a behavior that otherwise goes extinct.

Haplodiploidy is a sex-determination system where males develop from unfertilized eggs (haploid) and females from fertilized ones (diploid), common in ants and bees.

## hermaphrodity
Then, the only other way it is stabilized is by hermaphrodity, which is the case in the Corbicula clams. Here, however, parasitism is driven by the male genome, where sperm exploit eggs of different species to clone themselves. If it were not for hermaphrodity in these clams, such a drive would result in extinction from a hyper-masculine sex ratio.

In clams like Corbicula, hermaphroditism stabilizes androgenetic reproduction (clonal males via sperm replacing egg genomes) by allowing individuals to produce both eggs and sperm, preventing sex ratio imbalances that could lead to extinction.
