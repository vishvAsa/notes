This is a good piece of writing for a layman's on the pathogen hypothesis. Source: [TW](https://twitter.com/AgentSaffron/status/1053723371752644609) On related matter, this genre of hypothesis in their broader scope also encompass Cochran's hypothesis for homosexuality stemming from perinatal infections. 

However, it should be stated that the pathogen hypothesis has been given here like the primary explanation for something which was otherwise without a proper etiology.  
The points made by Cochran in defense of his pathogen hypothesis are quite applicable even to this case.  

However, it should be clarified that other, albeit not
necessarily mutually exclusive hypothesis exist, which have not been given proper coverage in that article. 

For example big genome-wide association studies have suggested links to the G-protein-7TM receptor DRD2 for the neurotransmitter dopamine & most effective drugs target it.

Then the GWAS studies have turned up multiple glutamate-gated ion-channels and also voltage-gated Ca channels. These again point to genetic backgrounds with direct neural dysfunction rather than an autoimmune disorder for one subset of these disorder.  

Further the polygenic scores and the rarer copy number variations(CNV) make a case for the genetic side of things.  
Here is where these polygenic contributions might not be mutually exclusive with the pathogen hypothesis.  
However it is important to note that the GWAS and CNV studies point to synaptic proteins involved in synaptic plasticity which is critical for the processes of memory and learning.  

Thus, it is not surprising that these genetic variants overlap with other disorders like bipolar, v.low IQ, major depressive dis'o etc.  
Notably, such an overlap is also proposed for the pathogen hypothesis. 

Thus, it appears that there are direct causes arising from genetic variants associated with synaptic plasticity and pathogen related ones which might converge to a similar phenotype. Thus, I think both vectors play a role in these disorders. 

Most importantly, the ENCODE project recovered several enhancers in immunocytes associated with schizo via searching for histone acetylation patterns.  
This suggests that there is certainly a possible role for pathogens most-likely via an auto-immune mechanism. 

Given the role these disorders have played in the emergence of the Abrahamistic religions  
it does raise some speculative questions: 

Was there an elevated genetic predisposition in populations where Abrahamisms first took root?  
Was some of the buffering in an Abrahamistic environment favoring their increase?  
How Abrahamistic systems allow the memetic tranmission of expressions which initially originate from biological disorders?
