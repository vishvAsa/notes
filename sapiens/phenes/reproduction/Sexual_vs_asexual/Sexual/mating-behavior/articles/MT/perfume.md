The remarkable jumping spider Evarcha culicivora, which has as its highest dietary preference mosquitoes that have fed on the blood of humans or other vertebrates. It locates the blood-fed female mosquitoes by specifically localizing to human dwellings or to specific plants that attract such mosquitoes. Having fed on the vertebrate blood from the gut of the mosquito, it metabolizes compounds from the blood into a "vampyric" perfume that attracts the opposite sex. It cannot generate this perfume if it feeds on ordinary non-biting lake flies or male mosquitoes that do not drink blood. 

Several organisms use second- or third-party perfumes to attract mates. For example, male euglossine bees specifically acquire perfume compounds from orchid flowers, and store them in special sacs on their hind leg tibiae and use those to attract females. The fruit fly Ceratitis capitata might use plant essential oils like ginger root oil to attract females. Among vertebrates, it appears that starlings similarly might use plant-derived perfumes in nests to attract their mates.
