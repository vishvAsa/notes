From Rilke's 'Letters to a Young Poet':

The point of marriage is not to create a quick commonality by tearing down all boundaries;  
on the contrary, a good marriage is one in which each partner appoints the other to be the guardian of his solitude,  
and thus they show each other the greatest possible trust.+++(5)+++

A merging of two people is an impossibility, and where it seems to exist, it is a hemming-in, a mutual consent that robs one party or both parties of their fullest freedom and development.

But once the realization is accepted that even between the closest people infinite distances exist, a marvelous living side-by-side can grow up for them, if they succeed in loving the expanse between them, which gives them the possibility of always seeing each other as a whole and before an immense sky.
