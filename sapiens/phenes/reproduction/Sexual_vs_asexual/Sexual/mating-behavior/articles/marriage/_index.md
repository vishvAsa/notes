## Insecurity match
People "insecurity match" more than almost any other way to pair. At higher levels of evolution this is "principle matching", but 99% aren't evolved enough to create,hold,operate in a principled way. They simply "aren't there yet" - so what you see most is people pairing up who are running from the same monster

The insecurity you hold closest to you is what tends to most aggressively color/frame your reality. And to be compatible is to share realities. This is how the unspoken language of the soul can communicate with most ease - when the worldviews are seamlessly overlayed

Issue for 99% is the default normie worldview hasn't been consciously destroyed & then re-built/ constructed upwards from zero. They are still running levels of default programming, being ping-ponged left to right 24/7 by a "running away" of different things lying quietly in their own shadows

The "stickiest" pairings are the ones who's neglected shadows are in perfect alignment. The same insecurities with the same over-compensations. Normies call this "soulmate".
