Sexual reproduction involves combination of genetic material from multiple (usually 2) organisms to produce genetic material for the next generation. Usually these parent organisms are of the same species.

The advantage of sexual reproduction is that it provides a reliable way to generate variation in traits. Providing material for natural selection, this increases the overall chances of survival of the species.

## Static parts of the genome
Some parts of the DNA (eg: the Y chromosome in Human males) undergo no change during sexual reproduction. So, variation in this chromosome occurs due to other causes - ie far more infrequently.

This then provides a way to study/ trace the ancestry of organisms. By this technique, it has been hypothesized that Gengheis Khan is the most (reproductively) successful human male ever.
