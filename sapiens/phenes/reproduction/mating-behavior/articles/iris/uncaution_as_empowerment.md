title = "Uncaution as empowerment"

To many women, accountability and responsibility feels like oppression. If you tell most women to avoid being outside at night in deserted places, chances are you’re going to be called a sexist. No, it’s just called taking responsibility for yourself.

Men’s aggression and violence towards women is never their fault, but it is their responsibility to protect themselves from it. I don’t trust anyone who tells young girls to make themselves more vulnerable under some misguided notion of empowerment.
