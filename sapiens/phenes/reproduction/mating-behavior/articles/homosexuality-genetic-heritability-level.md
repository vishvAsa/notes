[This study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat7693) has changed my opinion on homosexuality w.r.t environmental influence. On the basis of a study with a sound sample size of 477,000 people–the contribution of all genetic heritability was estimated to be 8 to 25% of variation in female & male same-sex sexual behavior. This means at least 70% of the sexual activity with the same sex cannot be explained by genetics, hence showing a strong env. influence influencing people to do this. Meaning, society pushing LGBTQ agenda is making people with NO genetic basis for this show the trait.

> "We found in both sexes that same-sex sexual behavior was positively genetically correlated with several psychiatric or mental health traits [for example, depression, rg = 0.44 in females , rg = 0.33 in males schizophrenia, rg = 0.17 in females, rg = 0.13 in males"

This is important, showing a strong genetic correlation with mental health issues in people who had homosexual relations. This can explain why people with no genetic heritability are carrying out same-sex behavior. -–Think mentally ill teenagers growing up in this world who face a barrage of alt-culture memes, influence slowly indoctrinating them in experimenting with this. Environment plays a massive role in behavior, this is not pseudoscience at all. I am looking forward to an equally large study of 18-21 yr olds & a comparison w this.

TLDR: maybe 8-20% of people have a genetic basis for being homosexuals, the 80% others are people with mental health issues being groomed/indoctrinated into "Experimentation" with the opposite sex.
