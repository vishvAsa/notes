      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think as a matter of fact that Charles Darwin (1809–1882) and August Schleicher (1821–1868) knew each other &amp;ndash; just looked up those dates. However, as far as I can tell, they never read each other&amp;rsquo;s works. Darwin published his On the Origin of Species in 1859.  Schleicher presented his work on linguistic phylogenetic trees ~ 1850-1860s. When I learnt that they did not know each other, I found it even more remarkable. It is almost as if the Übermind does exist and the thought had entered it, manifesting in two separate people on the continent and the island.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
