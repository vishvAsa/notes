I tend to accept the existence of linguistic long-rangery indicative of deep homologies across language families. Most professional linguists and their fellow travelers see such similarities as convergent. But I see languages like viral genomes -- there are distant relationships uniting distant viruses that are not from convergence or later transfer. Given this, I have often wondered if any words in extant languages descend from Neanderthal or Denisovan languages.
