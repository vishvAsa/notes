In general, memory declines with age. But, for a few people, it remains clear and functional. [National Geographic, Nov 2007]

## Metrics
White matter naturally degrades as we age—causing disrupted communication between brain regions and memory deficits—after conducting a battery of cognitive tests and brain scans on 93 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 93. The observed weakening of these brain network interactions (associated with default state and executive functions) was significantly correlated with a measured decline of cognitive functions as a result of aging.
