## Target/ ध्येयम्
- Sedentary lifestyle is a major underlying cause of death, disease, and disability. \[[Ref](http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/advocacy/information_sheets/sedentary/en/index.html)\] It is characterized by sitting or remaining inactive for most of the day. \[[Ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary)\]  
    Note to self: Man is not optimized for a continuously seated/ sedentary lifestyle.

## Intensity training
- A 2005 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that after just two weeks of interval training, six of the eight college-age men and women doubled their endurance, or the amount of time they could ride a bicycle at moderate intensity before exhaustion. Researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, had the exercisers sprint for 30 seconds, then either stop or pedal gently for four minutes.

## Benefits
- Researchers from the University of Michigan discovered that a session of aerobic exercise increases storage of fat in muscle, which actually improves insulin sensitivity. (Insulin resistance is an important part of Type-2 diabetes.) \[[Ref](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070614170302.htm)\]
