## Risks and mitigation
- Successful Infection = Virus Dose x Time
- "**Indoor spaces**, with limited air exchange or recycled air and lots of people, are concerning from a transmission standpoint. We know that 60 people in a volleyball court-sized room (choir) results in massive infections. Same situation with the restaurant and the call center. **Social distancing guidelines don't hold** in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room were infected. .." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- "Social distancing rules are really to protect you with brief exposures or **outdoor exposures**. In these situations there is not enough time to achieve the infectious viral load when you are standing 6 feet apart or where wind and the infinite outdoor space for viral dilution reduces viral load."
- "The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events. In contrast, outbreaks spread from shopping appear to be responsible for a small percentage of traced infections. ... When assessing the risk of infection (via respiration) at the grocery store or mall, you need to consider the volume of the air space (very large), the number of people (restricted), how long people are spending in the store (workers - all day; customers - an hour)." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

## Transmission mechanics
- "We know that at least 44% of all infections--and the majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without any symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin."
- "Some experts estimate that as few as 1000 SARS-CoV2 infectious viral particles are all that will be needed." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)


### Virus expulsion mechanics
- "A single **breath** releases 50 - 5000 droplets. Most of these droplets are low velocity and fall to the ground quickly. There are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. Importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. ... We don't have a number for SARS-CoV2 yet, but we can use influenza as a guide. Studies have shown that a person infected with influenza can releases up to 33 infectious viral particles per minute." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

#### Cough and sneeze
- "But even if that cough or sneeze was not directed at you, some infected droplets--the smallest of small--can hang in the air for a few minutes, filling every corner of a modest sized room with infectious viral particles."
- "A single **cough** releases about 3,000 droplets and droplets travels at 50 miles per hour." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- "A single **sneeze** releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. Most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room). If a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles which can all be dispersed into the environment around them." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
