## Chemical determinants
### Cholesterol
One important determinant of blood vessel health is cholesterol levels,
with the LDL subtype of cholesterol being bad for your arteries and HDL
being good.

Smoking reduces HDL.

### Trans fats
Explained in [poison page](../../skills/food/poisons/).

### Oxidative damage
Since the brain uses about 25% of the bodyâ€™s oxygen, the brain is highly
susceptible to oxidative damage.

### Diabetes

Diabetes damages the small blood vessels in the brain, and eventually
rots these vessels to the point where they entirely close off. When this
happens, the brain tissue fed by the blood vessel dies (i.e. a stroke).
The diabetic brain therefore frequently looks like Swiss cheese, with
lots of little holes scattered all over the place.

## High blood pressure
Also damages the plumbing. High Blood Pressure ravages the small blood vessels that feed the brain, and over time leads to many little holes in your gray and white matter that are quite obvious on MRI brain scans.
