## Intro

### Unschooling
- Unschooling is an educational method and philosophy that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning.
- "Unschooling is education whereby the learner determines *what* he learns (content, pace, depth), *when* he learns it (any age, or not at all), *where* his learns (home, community, online or school) and *how* he learns (self-taught, teacher-taught, facilitated, classroom, apprenticeship, online, correspondence, book, video, game, experiential, lecture, volunteering, project, job, or travel)."
