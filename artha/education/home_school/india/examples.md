    - `She then took her children out of their elite private school in Pennsylvania and started home schooling. Ask Vijaya the reason, and she says, “The school they went to had children from highly well-to-do families and immense peer pressure to conform to pop culture, which was not aligned with our core values. That apart, I felt home schooling will teach them far more than what they learn in schools.” She taught them physics and mathematics, while English and fine arts were ‘outsourced,’ and they gave regular exams online. After relocating to India, the brothers did attend school but immediately discontinued. Siddhartha and Ashok are currently learning from the Stanford University’s online high school curriculum and give standardised examinations. Both boys state that they don’t miss formal school. They have time to pursue music and play the violin, apart from attending Veda classes and teaching Sanskrit. They are also learning Carnatic music from Trivandrum G. Seethalakshmi Ammal and the violin from Charumathi Raghuraman. Siddhartha says he is studying rare compositions from Padmashree SR Janakiraman.`
