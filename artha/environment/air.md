## Pollutants
### Particulate matter
- Size
  - Common measurements: PM2.5 (2.5 micrometers), PM10 (10 micrometers)
  - "It is generally recognized that smaller particles are more harmful to human health. Unlike larger particles, PM0.1 can penetrate pulmonary tissue, enter the bloodstream, and circulate throughout the body. Thereby, PM0.1 can damage a number of internal systems that may be inaccessible to larger particles."
- Measurement
  - Units: μg/m3
  - Instruments:
    - Can purchase USB charging censors which talk to phone apps quite cheaply.
- Health levels
  - 24-Hour PM2.5 levels (μg/m3)  55.5 or above : unhealthy for all. Sensitive groups get affected at lower levels (> 35.5).

#### Sources
- Dust from sweeping on concrete yard in Mountain view raised PM2.5 levels from 20μg/m3 to 148 μg/m3.
