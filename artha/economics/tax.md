## Tax in India

Advance tax schedule: [here](https://cleartax.in/s/interest-imposed-by-income-tax-department-under-section-234c).

## Tax on capital gains

Tax is levied on one’s gains realized using the sale of security holdings or from interest/ dividend income on such securities, with some quirky rules.

Long-term capital gains (Eg: selling stock after holding it for a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate.

Suppose one invests in a mutual fund, which during the financial year makes a profit, then one has to pay tax - even if one lost money by joining the mutual fund in the middle of the year when its value was higher than at the end of the financial year.

One can offset gains obtained by selling some securities by selling securities on which one has made a loss - but it is forbidden to buy the same security again immediately after doing so (wash sale).

Subscribing to a dividend reinvestment plan complicates calculation of capital gains.

## Retirement, medical, education funds

To facilitate and encourage saving for large expenses in the future, governments often provide tax breaks for special investment accounts for retirement, medical expenses and children’s education (college funds).

#### Taxation-deferred funds

Incomes earned using these special accounts are exempt from taxes while they stay within the fund. However, withdrawals, which are only under very restricted circumstances, are taxed.

Eg: Individual Retirement Account \[IRA\] in USA, PPF in India (government managed with rate of interest determined by them).

#### Profit-tax free funds

Money may be taxed at the time it is deposited in the fund, while withdrawals are tax-free. This may be relatively advantageous because higher incomes usually attract a higher tax rate.

Examples:
- Roth IRA in USA
- Various life insurance funds in India. (Unlike ELSS, they don't attract long term gains tax as of 2018.)
