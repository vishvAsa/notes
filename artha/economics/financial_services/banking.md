## Operation

### Capital

Bank owners make an investment - this is called the capital. A part of the bank’s capital goes towards increasing the size of the capital.

### Liabilities/ Borrowed money

They also borrow money from investors - in other words, investors deposit money in a bank. The bank promises a return on investment to the depositor, but this return on investment is but a part of the profit the bank makes using that money.

The amount of money added to the deposit (principal) is called the interest. The amount of interest accrued per dollar per year may be specified using an interest rate/ fraction.

#### Compounding

Interest is often compounded ie added to the principal with a certain frequency- daily or monthly or quarterly or annually. For fluid accounts - where the deposited money varies daily, interest is calculated on the money available in the deposit account for each day and is added to the principal/ compounded usually at a lower frequency - eg: quarterly.

When interest is compounded, a number called ’annual percentage yield’ (APY) may be used to specify compound interest accrued per dollar per year. Or, one may simply specify the simple interest which, together with the compounding frequency, determines the compound interest: In case it varies (and is applied) daily, this simple interest is often stated as 7-day yield.

### Assets/ Lent money

Banks lend money and get a greater amount of money, determined by a rate of interest, by some time - usually in installments. They sometimes tend to make other investments too.

The bank’s assets may be liquid or illiquid (eg: mortgages for houses when the real estate prices are falling).

The assets may be good or toxic, depending on their risk/ projected/ current return on investment.

With risky lending (ie: where the probability of default is higher than usual), the bank charges a higher rate of interest in order to mitigate the risk by purchasing or acting as insurance against default.

### Balance sheet

The bank should be capable of returning the money to the depositors whenever they demand it - as long as they do not do it all at once (a ’run on the bank’). So, always lent money <= borrowed money + capital. In order for the bank to be making the maximum possible safe profit, this should hold: lent money/ investments = borrowed money + capital. Banks for which this holds are said to be solvent.

## Defaulters

Banks initially often may try to restructure the debt - allow later payment, increase installments, reduce interest etc..

### Recovery attempts

Defaulters borrow money from banks but fail to pay back. THen, the bank employs various means - seizing assets of defaulters or better yet those who guaranteed payment, shaming and illegal coercion in some cases to recover the money. Defaulters with political power often get their debts written off.

#### Collateral

\[**Incomplete**\]

#### Insurance

See section on credit default swaps.

### Reduced capital

Bad loans usually reduce a bank’s capital. But, sometimes, the amount of bad loans exceeds the bank’s capital, and the bank becomes insolvent. The bank then is incapable of repaying the depositors.

## Insolvency consequences

An insolvent bank, having made bad investments, is incapable of repaying depositors.

### Guarantees

Small depositors are guaranteed to get their money back, up to a certain limit- usually by government agencies. But, such guarantees do not protect big investors.

### Economic consequences

Bad money lending leads to ruin of the lender; sometimes selling ownership of these loans on the stock market, they bring ruin to others: 2008 financial crisis resulted from bad housing loans in USA, for example.

Failure of banks also leads to a credit-crisis.

### Government rescue

The government, is motivated to rescue banks - to maintain GDP growth. This has been true since Roman times. Means of rescue are described for businesses in general elsewhere.

##### Nationalization

This involves stock injection by the government. When many banks are insolvent, the timing becomes important - all banks should be nationalized at the same time, in order to prevent panicked withdrawal of deposits from banks which are yet to be nationalized because nationalization indicates that the bank is insolvent, and depositors may suspect that the government may be incapable of rescuing it.

This nationalization is usually meant to be temporary - governments ideally find new buyers as soon as possible. But this is difficult when many banks are insolvent.

## Deposit account services

### Fees

Some banks may charge fees for their services, which are often waived if the customer has certain minimum deposits. Others may provide these services for free in order to beat competition, and to reduce workload of having to provide manual service at branches.

#### Service quality trade-off

Compared with Small/ local/ cooperative/ internet only banks/ credit unions, Large banks usually have the advantage of having a large ATM network and slicker online banking/ remote deposit systems.

But, large banks have the disadvantage of levying heavier fees, lower deposit interest rates, higher loan interest rates, worse customer service.

##### Advantageous combination

An high yield savings or money market account (perhaps in a credit union) with a checking account in a large bank; and ACH transfers set up between them.

### Limited withdrawal accounts

These include savings accounts and money market accounts - the latter, investing in bonds (the money market) usually yields a higher rate of interest. The number of withdrawals is limited to increase the probability of deposited funds being available to banks: It is 6 in USA. A certain minimum balance is usually required.

### Term deposits

Funds from these accounts cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time. Banks may allow withdrawal under certain penalties. In return for this guaranteed deposit, these yield a relatively high rate of interest.

#### Recurring/ periodic deposit

These deposit accounts require small periodic deposits. This is often done at banks and even at the post office in India.

### Checking account

Aka transactional/ current account. A checking account allows bank customers to write checks - so it can be used as money. It does yields much less interest than savings account - often nothing.

#### Check redemption

The person to whom the check is presented can redeem it for cash at his bank, which communicates with the issuers bank to get money from the issuer’s account. If the issuer’s account lacks sufficient funds, a penalty is imposed to discourage such irresponsibility.

##### Reversal/ availability

The payer’s bank also has the right to reverse the transfer within a few days (5 in USA) - so funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.

Also, one can refuse/ stop payment in case of a dispute between the payee and the payer.

#### Fee avoidance conditions

Chase: avg daily balance of 1500, no interest. BoA campusEdge: free, no interest. BoA MyAccess: avg daily balance of 1500, no interest. UFCU: Free, no interest.

Ally checking: free checks, .5% interest, no min balance, refunds ATM charges; bill pay reportedly unreliable. Morril Janes: 1.5%, min 1500.

### Automatic/ remote tellers

#### ATM’s

Banks usually have a network of ATM machines whence cash may be drawn and deposits made. A debit card is issued for their use. They may be associated with an incentive to encourage its use: why?

Use of ATMs maintained by other banks results in fees, eg: 2$ for BoA; which may be refunded by the bank with the account.

#### Remote deposits

Banks often offer smart-phone applications or websites from which deposits can be made. For example, deposits can be made by using the phone’s camera on a check.

### Bill payment

Banks offering this service send cashier’s checks or electronic transfers on behalf of the customer.

### Electronic Fund transfer (EFT)

#### ACH

With ACH (Automatic clearing house), money transfer between banks is done electronically within a given country. They are commonly used to process direct deposits etc.. To use ACH, one needs to know the routing numbers/ ABA codes and the account numbers for the source and destination accounts.

##### Reversal/ availability

The payer’s bank also has the right to reverse the transfer within a few days (5 in USA) - so funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.

##### US charges

Chase, BoA: Free pull, $3 for a push (not for chase?). PayPal, ufcu: Free push/pull.

##### Between USA and India

ACH to Indian bank branches and VISA cards is free if done through ICICI bank : they make money by using a favorable exchange rate.

With ICICI, “Outward remittances” used to transfer money from India to USA: While it is free for NRI’s, for residents, ICICI charges the higher of 0.25% and Rs 1200 for such transfers. They can be done online.

#### Wiring money

Suppose two banks have reciprocal accounts with each other: then, by sending a message with account and settlement information, they send money. Even if the banks do not hold reciprocal information, they act through ’corresponding’/ intermediate banks.

This is commonly used for international money transfers.

## Foreign deposit accounts in India

Higher interest rates make opening savings account in foreign banks attractive. Repatriability and taxation should be considered.

### FCNR Deposits

These accounts are held in foreign currency - usually $. They yield a lower interest rate.

### NRE rupee Accounts

Funds held in the account, interest earned on them and returns from investments using them are fully repatriable. NRE accounts are not taxable in India.

These may be term deposits or savings accounts (yielded 3.5% in 2011).

### NRO rupee Accounts

The principal amount is not repatriable and can be used only for local payments. However, the interest earned is fully repatriable. Income earned on investments done on non-repatriable basis is to be credited to NRO account.

Other current incomes such as pensions, dividends, rent, etc are also repatriable, subject to producing the appropriate certificate from a chartered accountant. Funds up to USD 1 million (or equivalent) per financial year can be repatriated out of the balance held in NRO accounts for the education of your children, for medical expenses for your family and you, etc.

### Investment routing

Portfolio Investment Scheme (PINS) is a scheme of Reserve Bank of India defined in Schedule 3 of Foreign Exchange Management Act 2000. Investments made from foreign accounts is repatriable only if it was made from a designated ’repatriable’ account.

As per recent RBI guidelines, NRI/OCB should have a separate bank account exclusively for PINS purposes. Transactions relating to their personal banking as well as on account of transactions relating to shares acquired other then under PINS including IPOs should be routed in a separate bank account not linked to PINS. Account/s can be joint.

The sales proceeds are subject to Capital Gains tax. The rate of tax depends upon the period of holding. Currently the rate for short-term capital gains tax is 30.6% and for long-term capital gains is 10.2% inclusive of surcharge in both the cases. Such tax will be deducted at source by the Designated Bank.
