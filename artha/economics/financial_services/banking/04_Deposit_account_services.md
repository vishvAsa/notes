## Fees

Some banks may charge fees for their services, which are often waived if the customer has certain minimum deposits. Others may provide these services for free in order to beat competition, and to reduce workload of having to provide manual service at branches.

### Service quality trade-off

Compared with Small/ local/ cooperative/ internet only banks/ credit unions, Large banks usually have the advantage of having a large ATM network and slicker online banking/ remote deposit systems.

But, large banks have the disadvantage of levying heavier fees, lower deposit interest rates, higher loan interest rates, worse customer service.

#### Advantageous combination

An high yield savings or money market account (perhaps in a credit union) with a checking account in a large bank; and ACH transfers set up between them.

## Limited withdrawal accounts

These include savings accounts and money market accounts - the latter, investing in bonds (the money market) usually yields a higher rate of interest. The number of withdrawals is limited to increase the probability of deposited funds being available to banks: It is 6 in USA. A certain minimum balance is usually required.

## Term deposits

Funds from these accounts cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time. Banks may allow withdrawal under certain penalties. In return for this guaranteed deposit, these yield a relatively high rate of interest.

### Recurring/ periodic deposit

These deposit accounts require small periodic deposits. This is often done at banks and even at the post office in India.

## Checking account

Aka transactional/ current account. A checking account allows bank customers to write checks - so it can be used as money. It does yields much less interest than savings account - often nothing.

### Check redemption

The person to whom the check is presented can redeem it for cash at his bank, which communicates with the issuers bank to get money from the issuer’s account. If the issuer’s account lacks sufficient funds, a penalty is imposed to discourage such irresponsibility.

#### Reversal/ availability

The payer’s bank also has the right to reverse the transfer within a few days (5 in USA) - so funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.

Also, one can refuse/ stop payment in case of a dispute between the payee and the payer.

### Fee avoidance conditions

Chase: avg daily balance of 1500, no interest. BoA campusEdge: free, no interest. BoA MyAccess: avg daily balance of 1500, no interest. UFCU: Free, no interest.

Ally checking: free checks, .5% interest, no min balance, refunds ATM charges; bill pay reportedly unreliable. Morril Janes: 1.5%, min 1500.

## Automatic/ remote tellers

### ATM-s

Banks usually have a network of ATM machines whence cash may be drawn and deposits made. A debit card is issued for their use. They may be associated with an incentive to encourage its use: why?

Use of ATMs maintained by other banks results in fees, eg: 2$ for BoA; which may be refunded by the bank with the account.

### Remote deposits

Banks often offer smart-phone applications or websites from which deposits can be made. For example, deposits can be made by using the phone’s camera on a check.

## Bill payment

Banks offering this service send cashier’s checks or electronic transfers on behalf of the customer.

## Electronic Fund transfer (EFT)

### ACH

With ACH (Automatic clearing house), money transfer between banks is done electronically within a given country. They are commonly used to process direct deposits etc.. To use ACH, one needs to know the routing numbers/ ABA codes and the account numbers for the source and destination accounts.

#### Reversal/ availability

The payer’s bank also has the right to reverse the transfer within a few days (5 in USA) - so funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.

#### US charges

Chase, BoA: Free pull, $3 for a push (not for chase?). PayPal, ufcu: Free push/pull.

#### Between USA and India

ACH to Indian bank branches and VISA cards is free if done through ICICI bank : they make money by using a favorable exchange rate.

With ICICI, “Outward remittances” used to transfer money from India to USA: While it is free for NRI’s, for residents, ICICI charges the higher of 0.25% and Rs 1200 for such transfers. They can be done online.

### Wiring money

Suppose two banks have reciprocal accounts with each other: then, by sending a message with account and settlement information, they send money. Even if the banks do not hold reciprocal information, they act through ’corresponding’/ intermediate banks.

This is commonly used for international money transfers.
