Chinese economy is growing at a fast pace. Politically, China seems to be stable in the short to medium term.

## Manufacturing

China has a trade surplus relative to the USA. It is a manufacturing hub.

## Media

China, due to tight censorship, does not seem to be a hot-spot for internet businesses. It blocks Facebook, twitter - anything which can be used to organize subversion of the government.

## Middle class

1.4% of urban households make more than $15,000 a year, and only 11% make $5,000-15,000. Chinese people have high savings, low borrowing tendencies, because unless they work for the state they are unlikely to receive much of a pension. Consumer inflation is officially 5.3% but probably higher.

## Yuan

Yuan is set to appreciate in value relative to the dollar eventually - though it is being gamed in the reverse direction by the government restricting Yuan access to foreigners.

### Lending

Chinese funds and government lend excess dollars to USA by buying US bonds. They do this in order to get rid of excess dollars and keep export profitable to their producers in the short-term, thereby encouraging further growth in the exports business.

## Culture

### Politics

1989 saw the Tianmen square crackdown.

### Religion

The communist party tried to eradicate religion starting from the cultural revolution - they tortured monks, destroyed monasteries. But this ceased in 1982. After economic growth in the 1990â€™s, recognizing a popular feeling of spiritual emptiness, the party promoted religion as an important part of developing a harmonious society, provided they support the party. Those that disagree are suppressed: Eg: Falun Gong, Catholic Church, some Tibetian Buddhism.
