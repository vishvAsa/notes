### Regular IRA and 401k
Tax on withdrawls

- lumpsum withdrawal at senior age - 30% for non resident aliens of the US + India tax - US tax.
- monthly pension: Article 20 of the DTAA provides that any private pensions and annuities (does not include social security benefits or public pensions) received will be taxed only in the country in which the taxpayer is a resident.

If moving to India while in a lower tax bracket, it might be advantageous to move these funds to Roth IRA.

### Roth IRA
no US tax, only India tax.
