### Income earned abroad
- If you are a resident of India, your global income will be taxed in India whether it is earned in India or outside India subject to DTAA(Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement) with the foreign countries.
- Wealth tax is not applicable on equity - so it's 7 year exemption for NRI-s is pointless there. However, when equity (say within the Roth IRA account) is sold, not much is spent and wealth in excess of Rs 15,00,000 (as of 2019) is generated - that will attract the 1% tax after the 7 year exception for NRI.
- Issues concerning distributions from US retirement funds - see [usa page](../usa/).
