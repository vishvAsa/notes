To facilitate and encourage saving for large expenses in the future, governments often provide tax breaks for special investment accounts for retirement, medical expenses and children’s education (college funds).

## Taxation-deferred funds

Incomes earned using these special accounts are exempt from taxes while they stay within the fund. However, withdrawals, which are only under very restricted circumstances, are taxed.

Eg: Individual Retirement Account \[IRA\] in USA, PPF in India (government managed with rate of interest determined by them).

## Profit-tax free funds

Money may be taxed at the time it is deposited in the fund, while withdrawals are tax-free. This may be relatively advantageous because higher incomes usually attract a higher tax rate.

Examples:
- Roth IRA in USA - no capital gains tax.
- Various life insurance funds in India. (Unlike ELSS, they don't attract long term gains tax as of 2018.)
