## Organizations

### Mission

Some organizations are focused on earning money for their owners by pursuing and growing a certain business.

Charitable organizations are focused on gathering resources (usually from donations) and spending them to promote social good by a ceratin type of activity. They are usually managed by a board of trustees.

## Ownership

At any given point in time, it is clear from documentation/ declaration who the owners of a business are, what portion of the business they own.

Owners usually get a portion of profit as ’dividends’. They have a say in appointing the highest level/ board of executives/ managers who run the company on their behalf.

### Shares/ Equity

#### Public offerings

Existing owners or executives can effectively divide the company’s ownership into a certain number of shares. A common way of expanding the ownership of a company is to sell these shares to the general public at a price which is either preset or determined automatically by an auction. This process is called the initial public offering/ IPO.

#### Dividing profit

Companies offer a dividend to owners by proportionally dividing the annual profits. This makes ownership of the company attractive, which becomes useful when the owners decide to sell more shares to raise more money.

High dividend yield companies offer a big dividend relative to the share value - they thus constitute attractive investment.

#### Market capitalization

A rough way to calculate the value of a company is to measure it by multiplying the number of shares by their market price. Depending on the size of the market capitalization, companies are classified into small, medium and large capital (cap) companies.

#### Privileges

Shares grant varying privileges: voting rights, priority in receiving payment in the event of liquidation of assets after bankruptcy.

### Succession

In many firms, a small group of people - eg: a family - owns a large fraction of the shares. Oftentimes, it was one of them (or their ancestor) who started the business, and one or more of them are actively running it.

#### Professional management

Sometimes the owners appoint professional managers/ CEO’s to run the company. Sometimes, they pick managers from their family. This is more common in countries where social contracts are weakly enforced, so trust outside the family is low.

#### Nepotism

Statistics reveal that succession involving nepotism in general results in poorer performance. This is often because the person given the responsibility of running the enterprise is not as capable of running a business as their predecessors - either due to lack of talent or due to lack of energy and drive to work hard. Also focusing on one’s family artificially removes access to top talent outside the family.

Japanese firms often rely on adoption to solve this problem.

## Starting and funding business

Entrepreneurship.

### Funding business

The effect of governments on business operations and running is described elsewhere.

#### Prototyping

People with a good business idea may get ’seed money’ from an ’angel investor’ to make a prototype. The angel investors may well be governments or university funds.

#### Launch

Then, they pitch it to venture capitalists who provide two rounds of funding in return for a share in the company.

#### Expansion

A third round of funding, called the mezzannine funding, is then sought for a possible expansion phase, usually after the company is profitable.

Later, the companies often get money from the general public at large, through stock market, in return for a share in the company’s ownership, as necessary.

#### Long-term Borrowing

This is often done by issuing bonds at the stock exchange or taking regular loans.

#### Short-term borrowing

For day-to-day operations, businesses may need money, but they may not hold any reserve capital for that purpose - all of it may be invested in expansion.

So, depending on the day-to-day financial situation companies  
borrow money from the ’commercial paper market’, where various entities (especially money market mutual funds) lend money over the short-term. Commercial paper is essentially notes acknowledging these short-term, usually safe loans.

#### Leverage

Sometimes entities are allowed to be liable for much more money than they are worth. This is especially true in dealing with stocks and bonds, where people can make especially risky maneuvers to get high returns: entities are allowed to buy stocks with the agents money, insurances involved in credit-swap make huge guarantees.

## Copyrights, patents and trademarks

Aka intellectual property, a much criticized term because it draws a analogy to physical property which fails in some ways.

### Patents

The purpose of patents is to provide incentives for invention and discovery.

They work in some cases (eg: chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and fail in others (eg: software).
