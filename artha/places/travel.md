I keep an incomplete list of places visited and hiked. Maybe I'll publish it some day.

## उद्देश-स्पष्टता
- बहुदा सद्भावपूरणम्, अन्यत्र तपः, अन्यत्र अर्थः
- तीव्रानन्दस्यानुभूतीनाम् अल्पान्येव ये स्युर् यात्राजन्यानि क्षणानि, तेभ्यो महान् श्रमः

यात्राकुण्डं यदस्माकन् तोषपद्मैस् सुपूरितम्।  
दुर्वृत्तावर्त्तसन्त्यक्तं लसेदायुर्गिरौ क्वचित्॥

## Activities I like.
### Pictures?
I liked taking pictures of extraordinary sights - for memory's sake - though the times when I look back at them are very very rare. I may capture fellow-travellers, though I see no point in taking my own picture.

### Playing with nature.  

While travelling- especially while in the presence of magnificent nature- I like to be challenged physically and intellectually. Rather than standing to the side and mouthing "adbhutaM" or taking pictures, I like to physically interact and play with surroundings. This leads me then to climb trees, descend into ravines, climb tepees, cross cold rapid streams with slippery rocks using all four limbs and so on. At such happy times - rare as they are due to my other ambitions- I reach the limits of my ernergy, ablilities and equipment, and I stop when I sense a real threat to my life - well in time. More comments in the 'Hiking Style' section.

### Interviewing strangers.

I usually take advantage of opportunities to interview strangers with unfamiliar knowledge and occupations - like park rangers, tour guides, tramway operators, paddling instructors, snow-shoe running old man on the Sierra, gurkha porters. I get to be in my curious element without the too-common strain of being careful not to socially screw up. A pleasure.  

## Hikes

#### Hiking style

My personal hiking style during early hikes was to move along fast and rest. In descent, this translated to flowing down like a river - a sort of controlled falling, attention being strongly focused on getting good grips for the feet. I sustained no injuries, and I often was ahead of the rest of the pack. I liked the focus and the opportunity to feel like merging with nature, and being alone with it.  

## वासः

वासस् तत्र यत्र स्वनुष्ठानमनुमतं स्वास्थ्यञ्च रक्षितम् शुद्धता चाऽपि शक्या। माध्वमठाः।

## भोजनम्
### अपेक्षाः
भोजन-सामान्ये ऽपेक्षा अन्यत्रोक्ताः।
बहिरशनम्। शीघ्रसाध्यम्। अनतिसम्भ्रमेण भोज्यम्।

## भारते रेलयात्रा
### समस्याकलनम्
- reservation-प्राप्तिर् बहुधा कठिनं स्यात्।
- शुचिर् न स्यात्। यत्र कुत्रापि मलं निष्कासयेयुः
- विलम्बो महान् एव स्याद् यानेषु - विशिष्य निहारकारणात् शरदृताव् उत्तरभारते।


### परिहारकलनम्
रक्षणस्थितेर् ज्ञानम्।

प्राप्तिसमयकलनम्।
- अन्तर्जालक्षेत्राणि सन्ति।

## सार्वयान-प्रयाणम्
भारते शयन-सौकर्यं भवति बहुशः।
