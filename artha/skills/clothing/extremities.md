## Shoes

### Heavy or formal use

Use water proof, breathable boots, with minimal heaviness. It must be
usable even on formal occasions.

#### Lace

Shoes that don’t require lace-tying are generally looser and more
uncomfortable during brisk walks.

There are shoes which can be easily (un)tied by just pulling a loop. Use
these.

Use easy to tie lace: lock/ elastic/ speed/ quick/ lace.

#### Avoid plastic shoes

Leather boots, rather than plastic boots, are breathable.

#### Quality of manufacture

Shoes bought from good companies, though more expensive, last longer.

### Comparison with slippers

See slipper section.

### Necessity of socks

See discussion about high-adherance slippers in the slippers section.

## Slippers

### Comparison with shoes

#### Adherance

Slippers in general, adhere more lightly to the bottom of the feet than
shoes do. Among slippers too, there are different levels of adherence.

walking is more cumbersome if adherence to feet is low. But, slippers
which have higher adherance usually require socks for comfort, often
because of the sweat and heat generated by close contact.

#### Adherence, protection, ease of wearing

Slippers offer lower protection from the surroundings.

Slippers are usually easier to wear than shoes, which often require
tying of lace. Shoes that don’t require lace-tying are generally looser
and more uncomfortable during brisk walks.

#### Coolness

Much cooler in summer.

### Absorbant soles

Prefer slippers with absorbant, possibly antimicrobial soles - they are
more comfortable and less smelly in summer.

### High adherance slippers

#### Beach socks

Like shoes, with nylon mesh top. Require socks. Available in walmart.

## Socks

Use thick jockey socks: less smelly.

Or consider materials which wick away moisture.

## Eye

### Purpose

Avoid the discomfort of having to squint at the sun. Or remove glare
from either the computer screen or from reflected light. Or improve
visibility at night.

### Choices

Buy some light safety glasses which fit over prescription eye-glasses,
with either smoke or yellow tinted lenses. Sunglasses should ideally
cover the entire visual range where the sun strikes the eyes: even the
top. For this reason, clip-on sunglasses are inadequate.

Or Use Prescription sun glasses or sun glasses which fit over glasses.

## Sun screen

Buy sunscreen with high SPF, but avoid ones with oxytocin (a synthetic
estrogen which easily penetrates the skin).
