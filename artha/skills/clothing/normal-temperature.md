## Materials

Cotton is popular. Absorbs sweat etc.. Better is something which wicks
away moisture: like nylon weave.

### Underwear

### Purpose

Prevent outer garments from being soiled by body fluids, body oils and
perspiration. Provide support for genitalia.

### Strategy

Use good (Jockey) boxer briefs with the elastic band embedded inside the
cloth.

## Upper body

Use T shirts next to the body. Use collarless, light colored ones if
wearing a formal shirt above.

## Pants

Buy pants which sit on the waist.
