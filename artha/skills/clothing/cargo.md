## Belt

Useful not only for holding up pants tightly to the waist, ensuring good
weight distribution, but also enables attachments like pouches.

Buy a synthetic material belt, ideally one which can be used in
professional circumstances, with very little metal (no big belt buckle),
so that it need not be removed for airport security checks.

## Cargo pants/ shorts

Can be found in military stores or online. Professional look is
achievable.

If heavy items are carried in lower pockets, belt is required.

Carrying items in back pant pockets can slightly affect sitting posture.

## Vests

### Types and purchase spots

Tactical vests are not suitable. Ranger vests or (photo) journalists/
travel/ carry vests have many large pockets inside and outside (both in
the front and in the back). Ranger vests tend to come with full zipper.
Journalist vests tend to have larger and more pockets. Those made with
mesh are the lightest.

If a suitable material (cotton or polyester + cotton or mesh) is used,
the vest is light and breathable, therefore is fit for use in summer.

### Neatness

Black colored ones tend to complement light colored shirts well, and are
suitable for professional use.

Goodness of fit is variable. In good vests a draw chord is provided.

Can be used to hide crumpled shirt and loose fitting pants.

### Use in Carrying/ storing
They distribute weight over the shoulders very well; thus they are very

comfortable.

One can store items in the vest while varying shirts and pants.

It is also convenient to place all carried contents together for
inspection at airports.

## Non-clothes Attachments

Bags.

## Pouches

Often equipped with special detachable loops, so that the pouch can
easily be attached to a belt. These are often marked Molle compatible
pouches in Military stores, where they are often available for cheap.

### Waist pouches

Maxpedition thermite versipack is conveniently part of a belt.

### Leg drop pouches

The lower strap, if tied can cause chafing; so it is a good idea to
leave it untied.
