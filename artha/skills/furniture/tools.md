### Saw
Descending order of preference

  - Slightline Pendulum Jigsaw
    - Pendulum movement, where the blade goes back and forth as well as up and down, helps go through thick wood pieces more quickly.
  - Electric sabre saw
    - Can get cheaper reciprocating saw attachement for drills 
    - Harder to control than jigsaw
  - Hand saw
  - Hack saw
- Table circle saw
