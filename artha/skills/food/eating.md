Never aim to say ’I am full’ after eating; instead aim to say: ’I won’t
be hungry for 4 hours.’. Do not eat to relieve boredom or to take a
break. Let it not be the dominant source of Ananda - use buddhi instead
to gain Ananda from dhArmika-kAryas\!

Example: Okinawans stop eating before they are 80% full: they say this
to themselves before eating.

### Eating out

Most restaurants and food venues give more than enough food for one
meal. Don’t eat it all at once. When eating out, take home leftovers and
have 2 meals for the price of 1.
