Potential thesis topics:

\part{Computer science}
\section{Theoretical computer science}
Problems dealt with in theoretical computer science ultimately have their origin in practical problems. But, some of these problems are so hard that many subsidiary theoretical questions arise. Eg: Computational complexity research.

Our descendents, equipped with genetically engineered brains and better interface with machines, may be much better equipped to do deep theory. Perhaps theory is better served by accelerating their arrival.

\section{Experimental computer science}

Often, researchers in such areas use experiments when it is difficult to theoretically prove a conjecture. Eg: The study of wireless and wired networks, distributed systems, computational biology. The ideas are mathematically well motivated but unproved. Eg: Dimensionality reduction using Principal component analysis.

A rich source of problems is found in the act of building systems.

\section{Algorithms}

\section{Numerical analysis}
Enter the field of continuous mathematics algorithms from the perspective of theoretical CS.

\section{Graphs}
Analytically prove power law group size distribution in KDD affiliation networks paper.

\subsection{Graph generation with certain community structure}
Given the k*k q(xhat, yhat) matrix, which specifies the edge densities between various node clusters, make a generative model which produces graphs with that clustering structure, such that it possesses various static and temporal properties of real world graphs.

\begin{itemize}
\item A trivial solution seems to exist if the diagonal entries heavily dominate others. Is this well motivated?
\subitem This was implemented in R using igraph. Power law degree distribution was experimentally verified. Yet to be verified: cluster structure.
\subitem Analytical proof of cluster structure pending. Is this an (a, b) cluster in the Tarjan sense?
\item Verify the matrix generated by the implemented code by applying information theoretic coclustering. Obstruction: inability to write sparse matreces due to lack of necessary library in old R version.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Graph generation with hierarchical community structure}
Construct a graph generative model which, besides having good static and temporal properties displayed by graphs evolved using other models, also shows hierarchical community structure.

\begin{itemize}
\item This can be done if the idea to use affiliation networks algorithm to generate clusters and then interconnect them works.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Co-Clustering affiliation networks}

Time Complexity of the algorithm should be small: social networks tend to be large.

Community clusters defined by common members vs community clusters defined by dense subgraphs.

Use special properties of these networks to improve clustering. Try to use information from corresponding social network A to better cocluster the affiliation nw B.

\subsubsection{Ideas}
Look at users $\set{u_{i}}$ as features, then community c is a point in feature space: a binary vector. Want to map it into a kernel space where similarities between users is taken into account while measuring $\dprod{c_{1}, c_{2}} = k(c_{1}, c_{2}) = \sum_{i,j} s(u_{i}, u_{j})$ for similarity fn s.
\subitem Credits: pratIk.
\subitem (jengdo.Ng) For adj matrix A, any s() can be considered as $\sum w_{i}A^{i}$.

Using LSA or its Bayesian version LDA.
\subitem Find latent factors: $\min \norm{B-P^{T}Q} + g\norm{A-P^{T}P}$, where P and Q are latent factor matreces for rows(A) and cols(A). Thence finding latent factors P to account for both B and A. Then use LDA for coclustering.

Try using a modified version of the Von Neumann kernel pair.

Minimize a normalized cut objective using established algorithms: spectral clustering, or graclus, which does not involve ev computation.

Merge user-user and user-group graphs giving different weights to different kinds of edges. Then try various clustering algorithms.

\paragraph*{Using (a, b) clustering}
(Tarjan et al) Cluster notion defined by internal density and external sparsity. Can find overlapping clusters. $\gr$ champion of a cluster: no more than $\gr |C|$ edges go out of the cluster.

Cluster among users can define community clusters and vice versa.

The (a, b) clustering notion is not suitable for clustering affiliation: actors must be connected to $b|C|$ communities: $|C|$ restricted by number of communities.

New notion: $(a_{u}, b_{u}, a_{g}, b_{g})$ cluster of $|U|$ users and $|G|$ groups with $(\gr_{u}, \gr_{g})$ champion pair. (credits: pratIk.) A small modification to .

This is not equivalent to doing (a, b) clustering after folding the affiliation network to get a user-user graph. When you fold the graph, you loose some information: $(a_{u}, b_{u}, a_{g}, b_{g})$ cluster becomes $(b_u a_g +a_{u}|G|/|U|, b_{u}b_{g})$ cluster.

Extend to use social network.

From experimental data, time required seems to be $O(n^{2})$. Make it faster, or parallelize it.

\item Try applying the Trajan algorithm.

\item Try the algorithm where ye cluster users and clusters by iteratively folding the affiliation nw to get user nw/ community nw and then using clusters in one nw to cluster the other nw.

Protein structure prediction as a Constraint satisfaction problem:
          o In iterative formulation:
                + backtracking search
          o In complete formulation:
                + Minimum conflict heuristic

Use the fact that a significant part of the protein is disordered, with the "fail first" heuristic to undertake more efficient conformation space search.

Ensuring proper sampling of the conformation space:
          o Start from the structure of a denatured protein.
          o Cotranslational folding: Fold a protein as it folds.
