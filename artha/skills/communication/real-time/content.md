In conversation, it is better to talk about others’ work and learn, than
to talk about oneself.

Ask questions that require more than a simple "yes" or "no" answer to
subtly encourage a shy or introverted person to keep talking.

Conduct interviews. Make them talk about themselves and their work.

Be prepared - try not to ask questions which could have been answered by
other means. Special questions: How did you get your job? How did you
decide you wanted to pursue this specific career? Did you have a mentor
who helped you? Did you have role models? What satisfactions do you get
from your position? Did the organizational culture turn out to be what
you expected? How were the most recently employed people hired? How
would you suggest someone with my background to look for a job?
Professors: Do you have any suggestions which may help my research or
graduate studies?

Prepare answers for questions.

Compliment them - Everyone has an ego. But, don’t overdo it.

If they’re close, inquire about their family.

## Exchange stories

Eg, in case of friends: Ask for a personal story of childhood or home,
and give one in return.
