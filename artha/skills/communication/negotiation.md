title: Negotiation
---

Use the Statue strategy to project forcefulness when necessary.

It is always better to take time to think and then produce a response,
than to produce a bad response.

Don’t be fooled by smooth-talkers. They work mostly by making you take
instantaneous decisions. Take as much time as you can while taking major
decisions - such as those that involve a lot of money.

Determine the other person’s motivation in interacting with you.

Negotiation is best done early: before everyone is too estranged to be
rational.

Even if you are getting a free service, you have right to every courtesy
due to a customer, and to the promised service in full. Be forceful but
polite in demanding it. Remember that you can ask to see the boss.

Get things in writing.
