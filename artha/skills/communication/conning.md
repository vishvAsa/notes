title: Conning
---

Control of body language during lying, and its detection are considered
elsewhere.

Conning requires generation of trust on the part of the victim. One
clever way of doing this is by stimulating oxytocin generation in the
victim by appearing to place trust and regard in him, thus triggering
the reciprocation mechanism. Eg: Pegion drop con.

Even simple lying exploits to a certain extant the willingness of the
victim to be lied to, his eagerness to believe in something false.
