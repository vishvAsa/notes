title: Conning

Control of body language during lying, and its detection are considered elsewhere.

Conning requires generation of trust within the victim. One clever way of doing this is by stimulating oxytocin generation in the victim by appearing to place trust and regard in him, thus triggering the reciprocation mechanism. Eg: Pegion drop con.

Even simple lying exploits to a certain extant the willingness of the victim to be lied to, his eagerness to believe in something false.
