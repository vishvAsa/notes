## Cubes with 1 side open
- If the combustion area is large enough and not cramped, equivalent to burning wood out in the open. Or in principle equivalent to a "Cube with 2 sides open" type stove with pot on top.  
- Example: traditional homa-kUNDa-s (Idealized).

</div>

### Characteristics 
- Consumes quite a bit of wood. 
- Lot of smoke when the fire is low, and in the initial and terminal stages. 
- Ash accumulation + charcoal creation observed.

### Improvement with grill and sieve
This seems to achieve characteristics similar to "Cube with 2 sides open + holes for ventilation at the bottom and sides" type described below.

### Improvement with holes, fan fitted at bottom
#### supernova model 
- "this kund generates lowest % of carbon-monoxide and needs less quantity of yagna herbal material as the material is vaporized and gasified 100% without waste because the temperature attained by the kunda is always above 300°C along with the purified flames upto 1300°C, the Kund is designed from copper pot to get the uniform temperature along with the impact of copper oxygenation which play vital role in purification of atmosphere. "

- "The fallen ash collects in a bottom plate, above the fan, which can be disposed easily.
   You can adjust the speed of the fan, or use it for initial jwalanam, then switch off. 
   I think this will be more useful where charu, apoopa etc are offered as havis."

## Cube with 2 sides open
### Characteristics 
- Relatively inefficient burning - tends to produce charcoal besides ash, quite a bit of smoke.
- Indian cooking smoke (indoor) said to equal 20 cigarettes a day (source: prakti promotional video).
- Temperature at top: max 580°C ([IG18](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgLspLPlHN0/))

## Realizations
- mud stoves cost 250 Rs in 2018 and lasted 6 months.

## Cube with 2 sides open + holes for ventilation at the bottom and sides
### Realizations
- Prakti woodstove.

### Characteristics 
- Relatively efficient burning. 70 to 90% less smoke compared to basic "Cube with 2 sides open". (Numbers from prakti woodstove videos 2018.) Is this still equal to 2 cigarettes a day (going by prakti promotional videos)?


## Rocket stove
- Good YT explanation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TmWvLyaGdk).
- Types: L and J shapes.

### Characteristics
- Temperature at top: 715°C ([IG18](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgLspLPlHN0/)). With good insulation, can even reach 1100°C  ([IG18](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjkR34FBXob))
- Burns about 1 kg of fuel per hour ([himalayan video](https://youtu.be/tbBilWdfPgM)).

### Operation
- Must clean up ash buildup at the bottom so as to not block air. 
- One needs to keep pushing the wood in - with hand or with gravity to keep the stove burning.

### Key principles
- Air intake: One leaves generous space to suck in air from under the mesh which holds the wood fuel sticks - or one provides a separate air intake pipe at the bottom.
- Chimney effect - described seperately.
  - Needs a minimum height.
- Even the smoke/ soot burns in good models.
- Limited fuel consumption:
  - Only a small part of the wood ever burns - very efficiently at that, at high temperature.
- **Insulation**: Combustion, air-sucking and cooking efficiency keeps increasing with temperature increase. So, the stove body is ideally well insulated.

## Chimneys
- The addition of chimneys, in all cases, reduces smoke pollution. It also increases combustion efficiency due to the chimney effect - more effectively pulling fresh air.
- Chimney effect - height of the chimney is directly proportional to the pressure with which cold air gets sucked in.
