## Health concerns
- myriad chemicals to enhance the product shelf life, color, texture and other properties.
- Bad coloring chemicals: Lead, mercury or chromium compounds.
  - A 2018 study by New Delhi-based think tank, Toxics Link, tested 20 samples (collected from Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur and Rajasthan) from Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) for the presence of lead. Barring three — Home Care glossy (white),Varlac Premium Satin Enamel (olive) and Varlac Premium Satin Enamel (cherry red) — all had lead content from 101 ppm to 1,30,797 ppm

### VOCs
- volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which vaporize as soon as they are exposed to the atmosphere. Bad for health, odor suffocating. Headaches, nausea and dizziness can also result from exposure to the chemicals in conventional paints. Some long-term effects include liver and kidney damage, respiratory issues and even cancer. Specially affects painters, rather than homeowners who move in after some time.
- most green certifications stand for VOC in the paint base. VOC in colouring agents in the paint, the biggest contributor of VOC, is often ignored. As a thumb rule, darker colours and glossier paints have more VOC. 

## Environment
- The by-products and waste of the synthetic chemical industry is detrimental to the environment and it leaves an immense carbon footprint.

## Categories / certifications
- BIS has recently reduced the standard for lead in normal paints from 1,000 ppm to 90 ppm, following the example of the US and China.
- IGBC - GreenPro certifies products. 
- IGBC - GreenCo - for manufacturing process.
- Zero-VOC paints: The level of VOCs in these paints is so low that they can be termed as ‘zero-VOC paints’. As per the EPA* standard, the total VOC content should be less than 5 gram per liter of paint.
- Low-VOC paints: As specified by the EPA, these paints can have VOC concentrations ranging from 5 to 200 gram per liter of paint.
