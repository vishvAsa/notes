### Doot naturals "vedic" brand
- Their interior and textured wall paint (aka base coat) is said to be completely natural. Their glossy wood paints contain additives. They don't disclose the ingredients.
- Manufacturer Manoj Doot estimated in 2021 that exterior texture paint lasts atleast 3 years in Bengaluru weather. This would not apply to "interior" paints.
- Said to be slightly cheaper than regular cheical paint and more health/ environment friendly. But, as of 2021, they shipped in plastic containers (rather than sending powder in a gunny bag).

#### General applicaiton
- If chemical paint was applied, it should be removed.
- Cure wall well before and after (a couple of times). First curing after paint application may need to be gentle (use a tumbler rather than a water jet), and should be done after the paint has dried.
- Wall should stay wet 3 hours after application for the paint to bond well.
- Paint should be allowed to fully dry before another coat is applied (leave for a day). Otherwise, paint will peel off.

#### Texture paint application
- The textured paint can be applied to walls and floors.
- Must use the "putty machine" to mix it well ([video](https://youtu.be/2LmS0A0z7jk)); then apply on surface and spread with a wooden "gurmAla" round and round.

- Application just as a putty on wall was unsatisfactory - much worse on ceilings.

- Absorbs moisture (even from wall substrate) keeps room dry. Durable.
