- Most floor finishes are water-based acrylic copolymers suitable for use under normal foot traffic.

## Dazlo
- Dazlo Floor Wax is not available at any retail shop in Bangalore. So you will have to order it through Amazon or directly through us. 
- The majority of components in the wax are of natural origin, but some minor synthetic components are also presents. The exact names and ratios of the ingredients cannot be disclosed.
- Coverage of our wax is around 500 sqft per KG. But for new cement floor, the consumption is more as wax get absorbed into the floor and you will need to apply at least two coats to get a good level of shine and protection.
- 2021 price: The wax polish rate is â‚¹260 per kg plus courier charges and 18% GST as per the actuals.

### Application instructions
- Dust and clean the surface.
- Apply a thin coat with a damp cloth using circular overlapping motions. Let the polish dry to a haze.
- It will be definitely better if you can use a polishing machine. In case of hand application, the buffing step is a bit strenuous.
- Buff with a clean soft cloth
  - Also, in case you find the wax to be a little difficult to buff, then you can add about 5-10% Mineral Turpentine Oil (available at local paint hardware shops) to the wax, mix it and then use it. This will make the wax thinner and easier to apply and buff.
- Replace the lid tightly after use.
