## Cost (2020)
- MS grill with installation - ~ 450/sqft
- Highly finished door (hollow?) steel - Rs 700/sqft (IndiaMart) - Rs 14.7k.


## Mild steel (MS)
- Aka Carbon steel
- rusts when exposed to air and moisture. This iron oxide film is active and accelerates corrosion by forming more iron oxide.
- stiff and strong
- exhibit ferromagnetism (i.e. they are magnetic). This means they are extensively used in motors and electrical appliances.
- Welding: Welding carbon steels with a carbon content greater than 0.3 % requires that special precautions be taken. However, welding carbon steel presents far fewer problems than welding stainless steels.
- no more than 2 % carbon and no other appreciable alloying element.

## Stainless steel
- Corrodes and stains less, but not stain-proof.
- 12% + Chromium added for corrossion resistance.
- very expensive. Hence items are often made hollow.
- 202 grade
- 304 grade  
- 316 grade

## Cast Iron
- >2% carbon. Brittle.
- Most cast iron plumbing systems had at least one leak within 20 years of installation

## Galvanized Iron
- Galvanized steel has zinc layer on the surface level, which when there is scratch, it tends to corrode.
- GI pipes - zinc layer may leach lead.
