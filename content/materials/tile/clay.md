## Clay tiles
- Oft turn black, collect dirt and moss.
- Appear to dry very fast - 12% water absorption. To avoid this, glossy or matte finish sealants are available which makes the tile less water and dirt absorbent. This sealants are re-applied every 4 to 5 years .

## Cermaic
- Ceramic tiles are made from natural clay that is mixed with water and molded. Creators apply a glaze to the tile to help protect it from water and scratches, then fire the clay in a kiln to harden it.
    - Glazes are a glassy coat on tiles. Can use heavy metals (including lead) to generate colors and textures. This can leach out.
- Water absorption < 3%.
- Ceramic tiles can get very cold in the winter, proving extremely unpleasant to bare feet.
- Direct sunlight may fade the colour over time.

### Porcelain 
- Clay used is of slightly higher density and is fired longer. Can be further vitrified. Properties more or less analogous to vitrified tiles.

## Vitrified tiles. 
- The clay is mixed with quartz and feldspar before it is heated in the kiln. These extra ingredients melt, creating a glass element inside the tile. This glass component makes the vitrified files very hard and resistant to any type of absorption. Water absorption < .7%.
- Double Charge vitrified tiles are fed through a press that prints pattern with a double layer of pigment; they are 3 to 4 mm thicker than compared to other tiles. This process does not permit complex patterns but results in a long-wearing tile surface, suitable for heavy traffic.
- **Color**: Unglazed Vitrified tiles: A dye is mixed in with the clay before it is fired. This dye makes the clay a uniform color, so even if the vitrified tile is scratched, the color will stay the same.
- **Polish**: Instead of being glazed, vitrified tiles are oft either polished or unpolished.
- **Strength**: more strength and scratch resistance than marble or granite which are more prone to breakage.
- Need a stronger adhesive than ceramic tiles.
- High embodied energy.

### Absorption resistence
- Vitrified tile has an absorption rate of 0.50 percent, which is nearly-frost proof, while ceramic tile ranges from 7 to 3 percent, making it unsuitable for outdoor applications.
- The surface of ceramic tiles directly improves indoor air quality because it cannot be penetrated by allergens such as pollen, dust, or dirt.
