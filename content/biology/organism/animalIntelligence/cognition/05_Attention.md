aka manas by Hindus. Attention control is akin to task scheduling in computers

## Types
Attention could be endogenous or exogenous (response to a loud noise). Endogenous attention is thought to involve frontal cortex and basal ganglia. Depending on whether it involves focusing sensors, attention is overt or covert.

### Number of tasks
Attention may be directed at a single or multiple tasks. Usually multitasking is accomplished by focusing on each task for a short period of time. There is a cost associated with switching tasks.

## Impulsivity control
This is the ability to ignore distractions.


### Attention span
Greater attention span, to a certain extant, implies greater executive function. Response to exogenous attention: 8s. Sustained attention on a task is around 20 minutes on average, though people are able to renew attention after it.

\experience{Attention span can be measured and enforced, leading to better executive function. Eg: Pomodoro technique involves a cycle of 25 minute attention span rewarded by a 5 minute break.}

### Effect of tools and activities
Nutritional and biological factors affecting the pre-frontal cortex are considered elsewhere.

#### Hands
Working with hands improves is known to improve executive function. Large areas of the brain are associated with the use of hands.

#### Working on the web
Working on a computer with access to the internet involves working in an environment rich in information and interruptions.

This environment rewards lower attention span with novelty. \experience{So, rewards associated impulsivity control should be stronger.}

Hence, one hypothesis is that, in the current generation, impulsivity control ability is decreasing on average. In the long term, strong executive function in an information / interruption rich environment, with the ability to handle lot of information may actually increase.

### Environmental factors
Attention span varies with motivation, environment, fatigue and ability/ fluency. Tasks where people are in the 'flow' (which are neither too easy nor too challenging) are easier to attend to.

#### Number of distractors
Studies show that if there are many stimuli present (especially if they are task-related), it is much easier to ignore the non-task related stimuli, but if there are few stimuli the mind will perceive the irrelevant stimuli as well as the relevant.


### Connection with age
Younger children have lower attention spans.

Ability to process multiple stimuli fully may decline with age after youth, leading to easier cognitive overload; but old folk compensate by focusing on the important information. \chk

Yet, people who have developed a greater 'cognitive reserve' show a slower decline with age and disease.

## Over the long term
Deep human thought is to a great extant parallel. Switching attention between various tasks, while returning to the same task repeatedly/ periodically over the course of a long period of time has the beneficial effect of increasing cognitive flexibility, exploiting the associative/ abstract nature of thought.
