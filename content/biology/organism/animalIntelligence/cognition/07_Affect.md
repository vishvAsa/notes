Aka emotion, vikAra.

## Distribution over actions/ thoughts
Emotion was defined by behaviorists in terms of probability distribution over responses (either to stimuli, or physical reactions/ sensations including in the brain) Eg: sadness increased certain type of responses; while others identify it purely with certain mental sensations or neurochemicals. One may extend this distribution to cover thoughts as well.

### Modes of cognition/ operation
On may draw an analogy with a computer which can operate in different modes; and whose computation and output distribution changes according to the mode. So, affects are like modes of cognition.

## Flight or fight
During this, hormones such as adrenaline and testosterone alter the body, brain and senses.

## Stress
### Effects
#### Performance
Stress in moderate quantity (Eustress) increases performance at a given task.

Stress in very high quantities (distress) negatively affects performance - memory begins to fail, social interactions turn dour.

#### Long term stress
Chronic stress leads to diseases like high blood pressure etc.. which then leads to secondary defects in the body/ brain.

### Common sources
Time constraints (often self-imposed) for tasks.

Social/ relationship stress. Frustration at not gaining others' respect to the extant desired.

### Common destressors
Exercise.

Time in nature.

Friendly socialization. Humor releases endorphines.

Meditation, chanting, ritual, focus on the present.

### Limiting the levels
Though short spikes in stress, and moderate levels of stress/ challenge are desirable, excessive or prolonged stress should be avoided. Especially, donâ€™t leave the stress switch on for too long.

One should limit one's ambitions to be just beyond one's current abilities - thus avoiding stress caused due to failure to meet unrealistic expectations.
