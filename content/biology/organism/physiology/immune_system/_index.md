## Immunity types
### Innate
- Non specific, acts within minutes.
- Infection → pathogen recogintion by receptors → secretion of cytokines and interferons→  activation of cells to put up defences (eg inflammation) or die if infected, recruitment of white blood cells to stimulate long immunity → removal of infectious agent

### Adaptive
- Long term, specific. Takes a week or two to get going. 
- Infection → Dendritic cells take infection to lymph nodes  → Stimulation of T and B cells in lymphoid organs → Expansion and training of effector T and B cells → migration to infection site → removal of infectious agent
- Some B cells become plasma cells, which secrete antibodies for years.
  - These antibodies can be used for detecting past exposure.
- Both T and B cells become memory cells and provide immune system for a long time (years), even after antibody levels are down. These can reignite defences later - Asymptomatic cases - less strong response, but much better than unprepped hosts.

#### Antibody prevalance duration
- Measles - decades
- Common cold - 1/2 years.

## Herd immunity
When a big fraction of the population is immune (from vaccination?), germs cannot hop.

## Cytokine storm
- From a chain reaction, more and more cytokines are sometimes produced. 
- In case of wuhan virus, this results in inflammation, formation of fibrin and damage to lung cells, weakinging of blood vessels leading to seepage and drowning.
