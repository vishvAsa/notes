## Immunity types
### Innate
- Non specific, acts within minutes.
- Infection → pathogen recogintion by receptors → secretion of cytokines and interferons→  activation of cells to put up defences (eg inflammation) or die if infected, recruitment of white blood cells to stimulate long immunity → removal of infectious agent

### Adaptive
- Long term, specific. Takes a week or two to get going. 
- Infection → Stimulation of T and B cells in lymphoid organs → Expansion and training of effector T and B cells → migration to infection site → removal of infectious agent

## Cytokine storm
- From a chain reaction, more and more cytokines are sometimes produced. 
- In case of wuhan virus, this results in inflammation, formation of fibrin and damage to lung cells, weakinging of blood vessels leading to seepage and drowning.
