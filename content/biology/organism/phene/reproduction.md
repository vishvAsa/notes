Here, rather than considering reproduction of cells in the body of a multicellular animal, we are concerned with production of entire new generations of organisms.

## Sexual vs asexual
Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. Some organisms are capable of both - they are aka hermaphrodites.

### Sexual reproduction
#### Combination of genes
Sexual reproduction involves combination of genetic material from multiple (usually 2) organisms to produce genetic material for the next generation. Usually these parent organisms are of the same species.

The advantage of sexual reproduction is that it provides a reliable way to generate variation in traits. Providing material for natural selection, this increases the overall chances of survival of the species.

#### Static parts of the genome
Some parts of the DNA (eg: the Y chromosome in Human males) undergo no change during sexual reproduction. So, variation in this chromosome occurs due to other causes - ie far more infrequently.

This then provides a way to study/ trace the ancestry of organisms. By this technique, it has been hypothesized that Gengheis Khan is the most (reproductively) successful human male ever.

### Asexual reproduction
Among bacteria, which usually undergo asexual reproduction, viruses play an important part in transferring genes from one organism to another - thereby generating variation in the population.



## Fertilization organs
Males and females have organs to get the sperm and the egg to unite. In case of mammals, males have a specialized organ penis (separate from the anal tract) to deliver sperms to the female; and females have a specialized organ separate from both the anal and urinary tracts to receive sperms from the male. In case of birds, reptiles and fish, mostly chloaca are used, which is a common egress for sprems, eggs, feces and urine; though in exceptional cases like water-fowl, males possess a separate phallus and females may have a separate subchannel in their chloaca to receive the phallus.
