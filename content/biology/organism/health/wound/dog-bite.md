## First aid
- Do not pinch, do not rub, do not disturb the wound. Suturing the wound is contraproductive! Pushes the virus, if present, deeper in the wound. Bleeding controlled via compression.
- Do not apply chilly/ghee/mud/milk/turmeric or basically anything on the wound. You need to avoid tetanus and rabies
- Wash the wound thoroughly under tap water (for 2 hours some say) with copious amounts of soaps. Rabies virus (and, those of its Lyssavirus genus) are sensitive to soap.

### Wound curing
- Rabies Immunoglobulin is given IV/Intra wound, and might be not given if wound is not severe/dog is vaccinated/region of wound is away from head.
- Tetanus toxoid
