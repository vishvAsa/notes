title = "Recreate Wildness"

+++
"Think of running for the bus as earning your calories. Think of physical work as hunting for your food. Think of cycling fifty miles as tracking an antelope. Climbing trees, jumping over walls, running up stairs, fighting, throwing, sprinting â€“ they're reproducing things your ancient ancestors had to do to survive. Again; you have to expend your calories to get calories because the modern environment no longer forces you do it. ... Make your normal life physically harder. Purposely, create physical challenges and expend energy. Run for the bus, run across the road, jump walls; whatever - you do it because you can. You do it because you are recreating a wild environment. You do it because the fossils around you can't, and you don't want to be like them."
