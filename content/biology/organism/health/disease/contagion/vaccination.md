## Principle
You inject antigens into the body. Then antibodies are generated, which last for a certain duration. Booster doses might increase the duration.

## Efficacy
- Vaccine efficacy - % reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions
- Vaccine effectiveness - ability of vaccine to prevent outcomes of interest in the “real world”
- For some vaccines, booster dose increases efficacy.
- If you have antibody resistence to the vector being used in the vaccine, the vaccination effectiveness is much reduced.

## Adverse reaction
- The adverse effects of the vaccine—even if, at worst, they all happen at once—are transient and a normal sign of reactogenicity signaling an effective immune response.
- Severe adverse reactions are a problem.

## Policy
### Factors
- Cost of disease vs cost of vaccination (including adverse effects)

### Herd immunity
- In some cases, herd immunity may never occur naturally, or may take a long time. Polio and small pox have been in circulation for millenia before vaccines eradicated them.
