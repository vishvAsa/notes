## Indian contribution
> Indians do variolation. Chinese + Arabs learn it. Arabs spread it to Turkey. Europeans learn it from Turkey but can't fine tune it. They get worse results because the inoculation causes the disease .. all this happen before 1730s. 1797, Jenner discovers vaccination.

Later, the British banned the practice. The high incidence of smallpox epidemics after this in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries could probably be assigned to the banning of this practice before the new Jenner vaccination system could become fully widespread.

### Howe's 1767 account:
> The inhabitants of Bengal knowing the usual time when the inoculating Bramins annually return, observe strictly the regimen enjoined, whether they determine to be inoculated or not; this preparation consists only in abstaining for a month from fish, milk and ghee, (a kind of butter made generally of buffalo’s milk) the prohibition of fish respects only the native Portuguese and Mahometans, who abound in every province of the empire.
> 
> When the Bramins begin to inoculate, they pass from house to house and operate at the door, refusing to inoculate any who have not, on a strict scrutiny, duly observed the preparatory course enjoined them. It is no uncommon thing for them to ask the parents how many pocks they chuse their children should have: Vanity, we should think, urged a question on a matter seemingly so uncertain in the issue; but true it is, that they hardly ever exceed, or are deficient in the number required.
> 
> They inoculate indifferently on any part; but if left to their choice, they prefer the outside of the arm, midway between the wrist and the elbow for the males; and the same between the elbow and the for the females. Previous to the operation, the operator takes a piece cloth in his hand (which becomes his perquisite, if the family is opulent), and with it gives a dry friction upon the part intended for inoculation, for the space of eight or ten minutes; then with a small instrument he wounds, by many slight touches, about the compass of a silver groat, just making the smallest appearance of blood; then opening a linen double rag (which he always keeps in a cloth round his waist) takes from thence a small pledget of cotton charged with the variolous matter, which he moistens with two or three drops of the Ganges water, and applies it to the wound, fixing it on with a slight bandage, and ordering it to remain on for six hours without being moved, then the bandage to be taken oft and the pledget to remain until it falls off itself; sometimes (but rarely) he squeezes a drop from the pledget, upon the part before he applies it; from the time he begins the dry friction, to the tying the knot of the bandage, he never ceases reciting some portions of the worship appointed, by the Aughtorrah Bhade, to be paid to the female divinity beforementioned, nor quits the most solemn countenance all the while. The cotton, which he preserves in a double callico rag, is saturated with matter from the inoculated pustules of the preceding year, for they never inoculate with fresh matter, nor with matter from the disease caught in the natural way, however distinct and mild the species. He then proceeds to give instructions for the treatment of the patient through the course of the process, which are most religiously observed; these are as follow:
> 
> ... They are ordered to open all the pustules with a fine sharp-pointed thorn, as soon as they begin to change their colour and whilst the matter continues in a fluid state. Confinement to the house is absolutely forbid, and the inoculated are ordered to be exposed to every air that blows; and the utmost indulgence they are allowed when the fever comes on, is to be laid on a mat at the door; but in fact, the eruptive fever is generally so inconsiderable and trifling, as very seldom to require this indulgence. Their regimen is ordered to consist of all the refrigerating things the climate and season produces, as plantains, sugar-canes, water melons, rice, gruel made of white poppy seeds, and cold water, or thin rice gruel for their ordinary drink. These instructions being given and an injunction laid on the patients to make a thanksgiving Poojah, or offering to the goddess on their recovery, the operator takes his fee, which from the poor is a pound of cowries, equal to about a penny sterling, and goes on to another door, down one side of the street and upon the other, and is thus employed from morning until night, inoculating sometimes eight or ten in a house.

### Holwell's account
J.Z. Holwell (FRS) +++(a survivor of Siraj Ud Daulah's black hole in 1756)+++ gave a detailed report on the widespread practice of inoculation against smallpox to the president and members of the College of Physicians in London, as follows:

> Inoculation is performed by a particular tribe of Brahmins who are dedicated annually for this service from the different colleges over the various provinces. They travel in small groups of three or four from place to place so as to reach various places some weeks before the usual onset of disease. . . . When they begin to inoculate they pass from house to house and inoculate.... Usually they inoculate outside of the arm, and between the wrist and elbow for the male, and between the elbow and the shoulder for the females. Before the inoculation, the inoculator takes a piece of cloth and rubs the part to be inoculated for eight or ten minutes. He then makes a small prick with a small instrument till a drop of blood appears. After that he opens a linen double cloth and takes from there a small piece of cotton charged with variolous matter which he measures with a few drops of Ganges water and applies it to the wound with a bandage. ... When the before-recited treatment is strictly followed, it comes as miracle to hear that one in million fails for receiving the infection or of one that miscarries under it.
