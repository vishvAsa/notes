## Effectiveness expectations
- There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection).
- Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.

### Risks
- 1) Those who are taking vaccines now may become complacent and not wear masks
- 2) The others not vaccinated seeing those getting vaccinated might assume they are protected and not bother
- 3) People might just take one shot and drop out for the second 
- 4) Those vaccinated assume they are protected immediately after the shots which is not true
- 5) People would like to wait to get vaccinated.

## Effectiveness duration
- T cell response following even mild and asymptomatic infection can last upto 6 months. See reinfection page for details. 
- What the duration of immunity is for a given COVID-19 vaccine will only be resolved once community-wide vaccination programmes progress. Phase 3 trials will tell us about efficacy and safety, but well designed phase 4 trials are essential based on representative and large numbers of those vaccinated and follow up over time.

## Approaches
### mRNA for spike protein
- COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make “spike protein”, which gets desposited on cell surface. Then, an immune response to them devolops.

### Spike protein injection
Trigger antibody development thence.

### Foiling Spike protein
- Idea is to bind and block S proteins.

#### ACE2 decoys
- Entry of the virus which happens through binding of Spike (S) protein of the virus with ACE2 receptors found in the lungs. If you use decoy ACE2 substance (which bind better),the virus might bind to this synthetic ACE2 rather than original ACE2 receptors resulting in less viruses thus reducing the inflammation in the lungs. The main problem is the short half life of this synthetic ACE2. Scientists are working how to increase the half life.

### Inactivated viral vaccines
- Hepatitis A and Salk Polio virus are inactivated vaccines. These vaccines have adjuvants with alum or aluminium that can cause severe reactions at injection site as opposed to mRNA or DNA vaccines.

## Oxford Astra-Zeneca ChAd0x1 vaccine azd1222
- Aka Covishield in India. 
-  It is chimpanzee adenovirus packaged with viral Spike protein instruction DNA, due to which the body produces spike proteins and thence antibodies to those.
- safely stored at temperatures of 2C to 8C, about the same as a domestic fridge

### Efficacy
- The efficacy with the first dose is about 70%. UK govt is going for single shot followed by 2nd dose by 12 weeks (will supposedly make efficacy 80%). 
  - vaccine efficacy was 62.1% (n=8,895; CI 41.0% to 75.7%), and 90.0% (n=2,741; CI 67.4% to 97.0%) in participants who received a half dose followed by a full dose.
  - The protection starts on the 22nd day after the first dose.
- if you have antibodies to the vector that they use, Chimpanzee Adenovirus results in neutralizing the vaccine efficacy. (Chinese had tried similar trials and had demonstrated 52% of their participants had antibodies to Adenovirus which is a naturally occurring viral infection.)

### Trial problems
- Trial had 75.5% white caucasians as the majority included. Blacks(10%)and Asians (3.5%) had very less representation. COVISHIELD trial from India conducted exclusively amongst the Indian population should be referenced for a fair assessment for the Asian population.
- Less data about 65 plus age group.Only 5.9% were above age 65. Antibody titre levels were less in those >65 years. The lowered antibody response was because the 2nd dose was given <6 weeks.

### Severe Adverse reactions
- Side effects wise,relatively more side effects reported compared to mRNA vaccines
- Oxford Vaccine caused 1 transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)  in a volunteer

## Pfizer-BioNTech 
- An mRNA vaccine
- Pfizer vaccine definitely reduces mild cases by 95% 7 days after 2nd dose of vaccine.
- Storage requirement at -70 C

### Severe Adverse reactions
- The exclusion criteria that was used during Pfizer vaccine trial included people with allergies. Bang on, on the field, exactly same happened. 2 healthcare professionals in the UK had anaphylactic reaction. Now the health regulators have adviced those having similar allergies or anaphylaxis should not get this vaccine.
- Pfizer vaccine volunteers got Bell's palsy(4 of them)

## Moderna vaccine
- Synthetic mRNA-1273 for spike protein.
- 94.1% efficacy.
- Shown effective about 40 days after injection.

## Novavax vaccine
- Directly injects stabilized spike proteins (mRNA or DNA not used.) This same technology has been used since 1986 with Hep B vaccines that are given to even infants and found extremely safer.

## Bharat Biotech Covaxin
- COVAXIN inactivated viral vaccine 
- DCGI approval for Phase 3 clinical trials in 26,000 participants in over 25 centres across India.

### Severe Adverse reactions
- 1 person developed encephalitis. Was threatened with a lawsuit.

## Other Trials as of 2020-12
- FDA standards - "If a particular vaccine doesn't demonstrate a minimum of 50 percent efficacy, it will not be approved."
- Russian vaccine Sputnik has no data whatsoever. Being tried in India.

## Failed attempts
- BCG vaccination effect.

## India
### Approvals
- Oxford/ AstraZeneca. manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India.
- Bharat Biotech - approved "in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains".

### Immunization priority
60% of vaccines globally, plans to immunise about 300 million people by July 2021. It will prioritise health care workers, the emergency services, and those who are clinically vulnerable because of age or pre-existing conditions.
