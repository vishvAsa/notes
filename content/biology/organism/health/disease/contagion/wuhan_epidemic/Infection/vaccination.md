## Effectiveness expectations
- There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection).
- Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.

### Risks
- 1) Those who are taking vaccines now may become complacent and not wear masks
- 2) The others not vaccinated seeing those getting vaccinated might assume they are protected and not bother
- 3) People might just take one shot and drop out for the second 
- 4) Those vaccinated assume they are protected immediately after the shots which is not true
- 5) People would like to wait to get vaccinated.

## Effectiveness duration
- T cell response following even mild and asymptomatic infection can last upto 6 months. See reinfection page for details. 
- What the duration of immunity is for a given COVID-19 vaccine will only be resolved once community-wide vaccination programmes progress. Phase 3 trials will tell us about efficacy and safety, but well designed phase 4 trials are essential based on representative and large numbers of those vaccinated and follow up over time.

## Approaches
### Foiling Spike protein
- Idea is to bind and block S proteins.

#### ACE2 decoys
- Entry of the virus which happens through binding of Spike (S) protein of the virus with ACE2 receptors found in the lungs. If you use decoy ACE2 substance (which bind better),the virus might bind to this synthetic ACE2 rather than original ACE2 receptors resulting in less viruses thus reducing the inflammation in the lungs. The main problem is the short half life of this synthetic ACE2. Scientists are working how to increase the half life.

### Inactivated viral vaccines
- Hepatitis A and Salk Polio virus are inactivated vaccines. These vaccines have adjuvants with alum or aluminium that can cause severe reactions at injection site as opposed to mRNA or DNA vaccines.

## Oxford vaccine
-  it is based on adenovirus packaged with viral S protein that the body produces antibodies against viral receptor binding antibodies.

### Efficacy
- If you use half the dose and then a month later,give full dose,it protected in 90% volunteers. If you used the full dose first followed by full dose a month later,the efficacy was just around 62%.
- if you have antibodies to the vector that they use,Chimpanzee Adenovirus results in neutralizing the vaccine efficacy.

### Severe Adverse reactions
- Oxford Vaccine caused 1 transverse myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord)  in a volunteer

## Pfizer 
- Pfizer vaccine definitely reduces mild cases by 95% 7 days after 2nd dose of vaccine.
- Storage requirement at -70 C

### Severe Adverse reactions
- The exclusion criteria that was used during Pfizer vaccine trial included people with allergies. Bang on, on the field, exactly same happened. 2 healthcare professionals in the UK had anaphylactic reaction. Now the health regulators have adviced those having similar allergies or anaphylaxis should not get this vaccine.
- Pfizer vaccine volunteers got Bell's palsy(4 of them)

## Serum Institute (SII) Covax
 
### Severe Adverse reactions
- 1 person developed encephalitis. Was threatened with a lawsuit.

## Other Trials as of 2020-12
- FDA standards - "If a particular vaccine doesn't demonstrate a minimum of 50 percent efficacy, it will not be approved."
- COVAXIN inactivated viral vaccine
- Russian vaccine Sputnik has no data whatsoever. Being tried in India.

## Failed attempts
- BCG vaccination effect.
