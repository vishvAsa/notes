## Duration
- "About 80 percent of infections, according to the World Health Organization, “are mild or asymptomatic,” and patients recover after two weeks, on average."
- Can last very long - "When I spoke with LeClerc on day 66, she was still experiencing waves of symptoms. “Before this, I was a fit, healthy 32-year-old,” she said. “Now I’ve been reduced to not being able to stand up in the shower"" [AT](https://medium.com/the-atlantic/covid-19-can-last-for-several-months-c3391bddbe6c)

## Severity
- "For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation." - [WHO-2020-03-06](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4)

### Heart
- Several cases are getting reported of young adults sent home after 7 days with a negative result,develop sudden symptoms and die. Suspected cause: The small blood vessels of the heart had intense inflammation an entity known as MIS(Multi System Inflammatory Syndrome),see the photograph taken attached below. [FB](https://www.facebook.com/drpraveenks/posts/10158729975141385) Exercise should be avoided for some time.
- Scientists took the mother cells called stem cells that differentiate to heart muscle cells and infected them with the virus. Within 72 hours,the virus could cause death of cells and stop the cells contracting.

### Brain 
- MRI based study has demonstrated micro structural defects in olfactory(smell recognition area) and hippocampus (short term memory area) which translated to loss of smell that is widely known in acute setting to memory loss observed 3 months later.

## Comorbidity
Severe disease can result in people with diabetes, obesity, chronic breathing difficulty (like asthma), compromised immune system.

## Causal chain
- Lung epithelial cells are infected.
- Virus is then detected by macrophages. They produce interferons and cytokines. But the virus is oblivious to anti-viral effects of interferons. Cytokines attract more white blood cells. So there is a cytokine storm from a chain reaction.
- This results in inflammation, formation of fibrin and damage to lung cells, weakinging of blood vessels leading to seepage and drowning.
