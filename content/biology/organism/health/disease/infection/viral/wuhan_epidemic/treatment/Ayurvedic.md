## Anecdotes
> My mother is 68 and diabetic.  She too was recently contracted with Covid. We did home remedy too. Our way was every hour Pranamayama,  2 meals a days with 16 hours of fasting.
> 
> My mother has never been down for this long in her life, Not cooking and cleaning was not easy for her. However She decided to listened to Gita, Garuda Purana, Bhaghavata, Vishnusahasranama meaning etc. At the end She said, she felt blessed to have had Covid, it gave her an opportunity to immerse herself in Krishna Conciousness ðŸ˜Š. She is totally recovered now with absolutely no English medicine. - vANI

> Steam inhalation: this really helped. Since we didnâ€™t have a steamer, we decided to use our electric rice cooker. We added neem leaves and turmeric to the water.
> 
> Tulsi decoction: every morning, we boiled, tulsi leaves, ginger, pepper in water. We consumed this decoction with honey. This has worked wonders for me with sore throat/ cough, for so many years.
> 
> Hot and fresh food: this is good on a daily basis, to keep up our immunity. From many years now, I mostly insist on eating fresh food for most meals at home. During sickness, this is a must, I feel. 
> 
> Hot water or warm liquid intake: taking a lot of liquid was advised. I have always preferred warm water to drink. Being prone to sore throat or cough, all my life, this is very soothing for me.
> 
> Mudras ... Homeopathy medicine ...
> 
> Pranayama: Brahmari Pranayama
