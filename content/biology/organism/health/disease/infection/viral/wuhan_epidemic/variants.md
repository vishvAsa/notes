## Strain difference
- Global database of GISAID which collects the genomic sequencing around the world.

## Victoria
Original is called: Victoria.

## 20J/501Y.V3 or P.1
- Manaus, Brazil. Later: British Columbia in Canada.
- 2-2.5 times more transmissible and proving to be lethal. more likely to cause serious illness in young people (20-39 years being 2.7 times more likely to die).
- vaccines work albeit some lowered efficacy
- Brazil used Chinese Sinovac vaccine which has lesser protection against the mutants.


## UK B.117
- VOC-202012/01, 20I/501Y.V1

### Mutations
- N501Y. Slight change in highly variable protein region [here](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1340755077594816518). One claim is that plasma therapy triggered it.
- It has acquired another troublesome mutation E484 (found earlier in South Africa strain) which makes it adopted well to escape out from antibodies,cause re-infections and lessened vaccine efficacy.

### Spread
- Scientists speculate the B117 arose from one single source in an immunocompromised one where the virus underwent mutation.
- In September, it first appeared from England.
- By Nov it accounted for 28% of the virus moving around
- Was circulating in the USA in mid Nov itself.
- By Dec 9th,62% of the virus was this variant in London.
- B117 variant “may be associated with higher degree of mortality” (30-40% increase in 60+ age group), in addition to 50-70% more transmissible. 


## South Africa 501.V2, 20H/501Y.V2,  B.1.351 lineage
- spreading faster,tends to have high viral load and possibly more severe to young adults.
- Mutations: N501Y E484K. 
- Preliminary data from South Africa suggests that the novel variant 501.V2 wasn't recognised by antibodies in 21/44 serum samples collected from people infected in the first wave.

## D614G and G614
- Round about Feb 2020, new variant emerged in the Europe that had a mutation to make it spread faster.

## L452R California  B 1.429/427 ?
- Resurfaced in Jan 2021

## NY B 1.526
- ability to escape from antibodies and vaccines.

## mahArAShTra B 1.671
- The other mutation L526R found in California makes it spread faster. more than twice as transmissible as the first wave virus.
  
### With E484Q
- The E484Q mutation makes it behave like the African strain against which most vaccines have failed.



## bengAl B 1.618
- It has a mutation(E484K) that is notorious to cause escape to vaccines.


## India B 1.36
- It has N440 mutation which might be the reason for some of the re- infections described.

## AP variant N440K
- Supposedly more infectious. But reports indicate that it's been swamped by B 1.671.
