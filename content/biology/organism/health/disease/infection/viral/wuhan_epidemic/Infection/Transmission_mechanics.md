## Overview
- "We know that at least 44% of all infections--and the majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without any symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin."
- "Some experts estimate that as few as 1000 SARS-CoV2 infectious viral particles are all that will be needed." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

## Virus expulsion mechanics
- "A single **breath** releases 50 - 5000 droplets. Most of these droplets are low velocity and fall to the ground quickly. There are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. Importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. ... We don't have a number for SARS-CoV2 yet, but we can use influenza as a guide. Studies have shown that a person infected with influenza can releases up to 33 infectious viral particles per minute." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- Speaking normally releases around 10x more - 330 (flu) VP per minute.
  - Yelling, speaking or singing especially in closed spaces is a big transmitter!

### Cough and sneeze
- "But even if that cough or sneeze was not directed at you, some infected droplets--the smallest of small--can hang in the air for a few minutes, filling every corner of a modest sized room with infectious viral particles."
- "A single **cough** releases about 3,000 droplets and droplets travels at 50 miles per hour." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- "A single **sneeze** releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. Most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room). If a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles which can all be dispersed into the environment around them." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

## Entering cells
Entry of the virus which happens through binding of Spike (S) protein of the virus with ACE2 receptors found in the lungs.

### Hand and face
- Virus lasts 9 hours on skin compared to 1.8 hours for Influenza.

### Surface transmission
- Seems to be a relatively lower risk
