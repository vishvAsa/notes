## Target/ ध्येयम्
- Stay at the lighter end of your body's frame
  - Over-muscled, fueled by constantly eating, is not healthy

### Age connection
- "As you get older you should dedicate a greater proportion of your diminishing exercise capacity to hard and robust exercise - yet you're told to take it easy. If all you do is “take it easy", eventually all you'll be able to do is take it easy - your body will have lost its capacity to generate and tolerate force, a high heart rate, acidosis, shocks or running for the bus - until eventually, even the normal task of walking up a flight of stairs is an effort and leaves you breathless. Senescence means decreasing variation. A diminishing exercise capacity is strongly associated with aging. An indicator that the physiological systems which enable you to exercise are no longer as effective."
- "In aging we want to maintain our physical variability (beta-blockers are designed to clip the heart rate to protect the patient; variation may kill them). Two things happen over time if you don't push your heart rate (HR); max HR decreases and resting HR increases. Endurance training lowers the resting HR but doesn't work the top end; a reason to keep up high intensity work, to 'push' the high HR, which also has the effect of lowering the resting HR."

#### Leeway for youth
- 1 Young athletes (teens/20's) can be lean & fit, even with a bad diet
- 2 They can progress even with a bad training program

## Motivation
- "As a biological organism the human body is adaptive; more than that, it is antifragile, this is an important distinction in that things that are antifragile need stress to improve."
- Sedentary lifestyle is a major underlying cause of death, disease, and disability. \[[Ref](http://www.who.int/moveforhealth/advocacy/information_sheets/sedentary/en/index.html)\] It is characterized by sitting or remaining inactive for most of the day. \[[Ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedentary)\]

## Intensity training
- "The aim of an interval (or HIIT) session is to arrive DOA at the end of the session not in the middle of the session"
- A 2005 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that after just two weeks of interval training, six of the eight college-age men and women doubled their endurance, or the amount of time they could ride a bicycle at moderate intensity before exhaustion. Researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, had the exercisers sprint for 30 seconds, then either stop or pedal gently for four minutes.

## Running
- "The key was relaxed running; no tension. Being tense slows you down and uses energy. When you run fast sub-max, relax shldrs and face, don't struggle, don't force it."
- Long runs - " Do not run too fast early on, even if it feels slow, you will pay for it later!"

## Benefits
- Researchers from the University of Michigan discovered that a session of aerobic exercise increases storage of fat in muscle, which actually improves insulin sensitivity. (Insulin resistance is an important part of Type-2 diabetes.) \[[Ref](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070614170302.htm)\]
- beneficial to cognition during early and middle periods of the human lifespan and may continue to protect against age-related loss of cognitive function during older adulthood. Exercise causes the frontal lobes to increase in size.

## Competitive sport
- Hyper competition is negative. "Getting injured is par for the course. Nothing as common. That's one of the reasons why competitive sport is not healthy."
