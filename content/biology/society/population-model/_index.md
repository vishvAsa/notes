## Criteria to judge models
- Does it answer some clear causal questions? (of the type: "Under conditions A, X leads to Y.") Or does it intend to make quantitative predictions?
- Is it sufficiently abstract (and therefore intelligible), and not loaded down with unnecessary details?
- Is it mathematically elegant (in a way that could contribute to building mathematical theories for their own sake)?

## Approaches
- Process based, open ended "theory"
- Fitting a model to a specific dataset/ outcome.
