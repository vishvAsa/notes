## NRE rupee Accounts

Funds held in the account, interest earned on them and returns from investments using them are fully repatriable. NRE accounts are not taxable in India.

## NRO rupee Accounts

The principal amount is not repatriable and can be used only for local payments. However, the interest earned is fully repatriable. Income earned on investments done on non-repatriable basis is to be credited to NRO account.

Funds up to USD 1 million (or equivalent) per financial year can be repatriated out of the balance held in NRO accounts for the education of your children, for medical expenses for your family and you, etc.

## Investment routing

Portfolio Investment Scheme (PINS) is a scheme of Reserve Bank of India defined in Schedule 3 of Foreign Exchange Management Act 2000. Investments made from foreign accounts is repatriable only if it was made from a designated ’repatriable’ account.

As per recent RBI guidelines, NRI/OCB should have a separate bank account exclusively for PINS purposes. Transactions relating to their personal banking as well as on account of transactions relating to shares acquired other then under PINS including IPOs should be routed in a separate bank account not linked to PINS. Account/s can be joint.

The sales proceeds are subject to Capital Gains tax. The rate of tax depends upon the period of holding. Currently the rate for short-term capital gains tax is 30.6% and for long-term capital gains is 10.2% inclusive of surcharge in both the cases. Such tax will be deducted at source by the Designated Bank.
