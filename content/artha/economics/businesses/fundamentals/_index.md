## Organizations

### Mission
#### Profit
Earning money for their owners is a major concern. Especially in the "buy buy buy sell sell sell"+++(5)+++ "dhandho" culture or VC-inspired "build and exit" culture.

#### Tradition and craft
Still, it is not the only reason why businesses operate - some just exist so that the craftsmen (and their successors) do what they love, so that traditions survive. +++(5)+++

#### Charity
Charitable organizations are focused on gathering resources (usually from donations) and spending them to promote social good by a ceratin type of activity. They are usually managed by a board of trustees.

## Copyrights, patents and trademarks

Aka intellectual property, a much criticized term because it draws a analogy to physical property which fails in some ways.

### Patents

The purpose of patents is to provide incentives for invention and discovery.

They work in some cases (eg: chemicals and pharmaceuticals) and fail in others (eg: software).
