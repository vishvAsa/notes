- Consider the [health map](http://www.healthmap.org/en) to track epidemics.

## Temperate Leukosphere
- Leading causes of death in developing countries according to \[[Ref](http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/cause.php)\]:

- HIV/AIDS
- Lower respiratory infections
- Ischaemic heart disease
    
### USA
 Most common conventional causes of death in the USA, according to [\[Ref\]](http://danger.mongabay.com/causes_of_death_percent.htm):

- Heart disease : 30%. 
- Cancer: 24%.
- Stroke, respiratory diseases and accidents contribute around 5% each.

## Heart disease
- 12.6 percent of deaths worldwide were from ischemic heart disease. \[[Ref](http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/en/report04_en.pdf)\] Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries, but third to [AIDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS "AIDS") and [lower respiratory infections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_respiratory_infection "Lower respiratory infection") in developing countries. \[[Ref](http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/cause.php)\]
- Heart attack rates are higher in association with intense exertion, be it [psychological stress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28psychology%29 "Stress (psychology)") or physical exertion, especially if the exertion is more intense than the individual usually performs. Quantitatively, the period of intense exercise and subsequent recovery is associated with about a 6-fold higher myocardial infarction rate (compared with other more relaxed time frames) for people who are physically very fit. For those in poor physical condition, the rate differential is over 35-fold higher. \[[Ref](http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/97/18/1837.pdf)\]
    
## Diabetes
- There are numerous theories as to the exact cause and mechanism for diabetes related insulin resistance, but [**central obesity**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_obesity "Central obesity") (fat concentrated around the waist in relation to abdominal organs, and not subcutaneous fat, it seems) is known to predispose individuals for insulin resistance, possibly due to its secretion of [adipokines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipokine "Adipokine") (a group of hormones) that impair glucose tolerance. \[[Ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2)\]
    - Many Asian people, particularly South Asians, are also more prone to abdominal obesity, the study noted. Skinny people with thick middles are particularly prone to developing Type II Diabetes, which helps explain why the disease is spreading in places where people are, on average, quite thin. \[[Ref](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1902100,00.html?xid=rss-world)\]

## Common cancers
- Several cancers that are extremely common in the United States— **colon, prostate and breast cancer** —are relatively rare in other parts of the world, occurring only 1/10th or 1/20th as often. ... Even if people in other parts of the world stay put, but adopt a U.S. lifestyle, their risk of cancer rises; as Japanese have embraced Western habits, their rates of colon, breast and prostate cancer have skyrocketed. \[[Ref](http://www.newsweek.com/id/141495/page/1)\]

## Infection:
- The levels of potentially harmful waterborne microorganisms in rivers, lakes and other recreational waterways may be highest when the water is most crowded with swimmers. \[[Ref](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070702145113.htm)\]
- More than one in four train commuters in UK has bacteria from faeces on their hands. \[[Ref](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7667499.stm)\]
- Close to 300 cases of tick-borne disease were confirmed in Washington from 1989 to 2000. \[[Ref](http://www.doh.wa.gov/ehp/TS/Zoo/WATickDiseases.htm)\]

### STD-s
- STD's are the most common infectious diseases. Top three infections among these are chlamydia, gonorrhea and AIDS. It found that nearly half of the African-American girls surveyed had at least one STD, the rate was 20% among white and Mexican-American teenagers. \[[Ref](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7290088.stm)\]

## Accidents:
- After 10 pm one in five drivers is under the influence of something or other -- and after 2 am it's one in four. \[[Weak Ref](http://marriage.about.com/b/a/053340.htm)\]
