## Risks and mitigation
- Successful Infection = **Virus Dose x Time**
- "**Indoor spaces**, with limited air exchange or recycled air and lots of people, are concerning from a transmission standpoint. We know that 60 people in a volleyball court-sized room (choir) results in massive infections. Same situation with the restaurant and the call center. **Social distancing guidelines don't hold** in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room were infected. .." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- "**Social distancing** rules are really to protect you with **brief exposures** or **outdoor exposures**. In these situations there is not enough time to achieve the infectious viral load when you are standing 6 feet apart or where wind and the infinite outdoor space for viral dilution reduces viral load. ... If I am outside, and I walk past someone, remember it is “dose and time” needed for infection. You would have to be in their airstream for 5+ minutes (optimistically assuming 20VP per minute) for a chance of infection.  While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed."
- "The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events. In contrast, outbreaks spread from shopping appear to be responsible for a small percentage of traced infections. ... When assessing the risk of infection (via respiration) at the grocery store or mall, you need to consider the **volume of the air space** (very large), the **number of people** (restricted), how long people are spending in the store (workers - all day; customers - an hour)." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

## Apparel
- Eye glasses - Wear any, but prefer full eye covering.

### Masks
- Even cloth masks help.
- Refer - [masks4all1](https://masks4all.org/), [masks4all2](https://masks4all.co/)
- WHO is retarded: "The WHO also recommends public mask usage during high-severity influenza pandemics – just not during this Coronavirus pandemic.", "WHO describes a MINIMAL standard. It doesn't mean that we couldn't do MORE."
- Errors in reasoning about masks by NN Taleb [here](https://medium.com/incerto/the-masks-masquerade-7de897b517b7). Suprising demo of effectiveness of masks: " the salon story where two infected stylists failed to infect all their 140 clients (making the probability of infection for bilateral mask wearing safely below 1% for a salon-style exposure) — we know the probability of infection for non mask wearers from tens of thousands of data points and the various R0 estimations) plus".

## Transmission mechanics
- "We know that at least 44% of all infections--and the majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without any symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin."
- "Some experts estimate that as few as 1000 SARS-CoV2 infectious viral particles are all that will be needed." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

### Virus expulsion mechanics
- "A single **breath** releases 50 - 5000 droplets. Most of these droplets are low velocity and fall to the ground quickly. There are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. Importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. ... We don't have a number for SARS-CoV2 yet, but we can use influenza as a guide. Studies have shown that a person infected with influenza can releases up to 33 infectious viral particles per minute." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- Speaking normally releases around 10x more - 330 (flu) VP per minute.
  - Yelling, speaking or singing especially in closed spaces is a big transmitter!

#### Cough and sneeze
- "But even if that cough or sneeze was not directed at you, some infected droplets--the smallest of small--can hang in the air for a few minutes, filling every corner of a modest sized room with infectious viral particles."
- "A single **cough** releases about 3,000 droplets and droplets travels at 50 miles per hour." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)
- "A single **sneeze** releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. Most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room). If a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles which can all be dispersed into the environment around them." - [EB](https://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them)

## Grocery disinfection
- "KMnO4 1% 1min is a good disinfectant for the viruses like the Wuhan virus. Hardier viruses like polio it is less effect."

## Hand sanitization
### Technique
{{< figure src="../../../../saMskAra/mantraH/rogAH/images/hand-wash-steps.jpg"  class="thumbnail">}}

### Material
- Soap works because it's OH part mixes with water, while the organic part bonds with fat membranes of viruses.
- Alcohol based disinfectant - > 60% strength. Vodka might do as well.

## Duration
- "About 80 percent of infections, according to the World Health Organization, “are mild or asymptomatic,” and patients recover after two weeks, on average."
- Can last very long - "When I spoke with LeClerc on day 66, she was still experiencing waves of symptoms. “Before this, I was a fit, healthy 32-year-old,” she said. “Now I’ve been reduced to not being able to stand up in the shower"" [AT](https://medium.com/the-atlantic/covid-19-can-last-for-several-months-c3391bddbe6c)

## Severity
- "For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation." - [WHO-2020-03-06](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4)

## Containment regulations
- [BBMP](https://covid19.karnataka.gov.in/new-page/GENERAL%20INFORMATION/en) Bengaluru, KA, IN
    - Esp. [SOP](https://covid19.karnataka.gov.in/storage/pdf-files/HFW_Protocol%20for%20Inter-State%20Traveller%20to%20Karnataka.pdf) for entry of state/ district/ country border crossers. 

## Origin
- Wuhan, China.
