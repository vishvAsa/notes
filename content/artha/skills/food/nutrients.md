## Fiber

Fiber can be soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fibers aid bowel movement.

Soluble fiber helps reduce cholesterol, reduces sugar response after
eating, normalizes blood lipid levels. Soluble fiber is not broken down
until it reaches the large intestine where digestion causes gas
(flatulence). In excessive amounts, soluble fiber causes high
flatulance, cramps.

Fibers in legumes, such as peanuts, beans is mostly soluble fibers.

Tree Nuts have insoluble fibers.

## Omega 3 fatty acid

Vegetarian sources of omega 3 fats: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, walnuts,
hemp seeds, leafy green vegetables. Unfortunately, however, most
naturally occurring vegetarian sources of omega 3 fatty acids are not
very rich in DHA (a very important type of omega 3 fat). How much DHA is
recommended per day? 100-300mg/day \[Ref\]

## Phytochemicals

Recent studies indicate that high intake of antioxidant vitamins
(vitamins C, E and beta-carotene) does not appear to provide significant
protection against Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It is Phytochemicals in fruits
or vegetables that provide the real benefit. The skins of fruits and
vegetables are particularly rich in these phytochemicals. Recent studies
have shown that polyphenols (like resveratrol in wine) extend maximum
lifespan by 59 percent and delay age-dependent decay of cognitive
performance in animal models.
