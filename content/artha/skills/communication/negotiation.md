title: Negotiation

## General strategy
- Determine the other person’s motivation in interacting with you.

## Customer end
### Info
Basic element in bargaining is information. Don't make rash decisions. If you don't have the requisite info - take time and look it up.

### Take time
Don’t be fooled by smooth-talkers. They work mostly by making you take instantaneous decisions. Take as much time as you can while taking major decisions - such as those that involve a lot of money.

### Be clear about rights
- Even if you are getting a free service, you have right to every courtesy due to a customer, and to the promised service in full. Be forceful but polite in demanding it. Remember that you can ask to see the boss.
- Get things in writing.
