## General strategy
- Determine the other person’s motivation in interacting with you.

## Customer end
### Proper attitude
- Remember the feeling of being conned. Savour it. Don't let it happen.
- Profile the seller. "Is he take it or leave it? Or desparate to make sales (eg. poor street seller)? Is there going to be a recurring relationship or is it a one-off transaction?" 
- Understand the desperate seller's motivations:
  - Upsell goods.
  - Charge more than the goods' worth.
  - Lie and generate trust.
- Be prepared to counter the desperate seller.
- Be prepared to walk away. Very important.

### Info
Basic element in bargaining is information. Don't make rash decisions. If you don't have the requisite info - take time and look it up.

#### Beware lies
- Don’t be fooled by smooth-talkers. See conning page.

### Team-work
- Better coordination among buying team implies lower risk of fraud.
- Be clear about responsibilities. Like: Who will check the bill items (not just total)? Who will verify the weight?  Who will take the final decision?
- One trick is to exploit discord among the buying team / family (one of whom may be inexperienced and fraud-prone by nature).
- NEVER contradict each other before the buyer by words or gesture. If necessary, speak in private.
- Poor coordination among the buying team may lead to greater confusion. For example, some person may keep interrupting during negotiation and not allow the decision maker to think properly.

### Take time
Smooth-talkers work mostly by making you take instantaneous decisions. Take as much time as you can while taking major decisions - such as those that involve a lot of money.

### Be clear about rights
- Even if you are getting a free service, you have right to every courtesy due to a customer, and to the promised service in full. Be forceful but polite in demanding it. Remember that you can ask to see the boss.
- Get things in writing.
