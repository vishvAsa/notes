## Criteria
- Filtered water storage
  - capacity
  - Material
- Certifications
  -  ISI, WQA or NSF
- Quality of service and maintenance

### Water quality
- Hardness
- salinity
- TDS (Total dissolved solids).
  -  TDS principally includes calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates, and small amounts of organic matter
  - Higher in borewell water
  - TDS levels greater than 1000 mg/litre make drinking-water increasingly unpalatable and unhealthy.

## Simple membrane filtration
- Simple Gravity filters. Good for removing mud etc..

### Microfiltration
- Ceramic filters - 0.2 microns pores

### UF (Ultrafiltration)
- hydrostatic pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane.
- Hollow fiber membrane used.
- Bigger pores compared to RO; so less effective.
- Membranes used are predominantly created from polymer thin films.

### Nanofiltration (NF)
- Good for low TDF
- Smaller (nanometer) pores than microfiltration and ultrafiltration; just larger than RO membranes.
- can "soften" water by retaining scale-forming, hydrated divalent ions (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+) while passing smaller hydrated monovalent ions.

## RO (Reserve Osmosis)
- filters 98% heavy dissolved solids: metals, particulates, minerals
- Recommended for TDS 200-2k.
- uses semi permeable membranes
- Wastes 2x or 3x water. Green RO water purifiers better.

### Membranes
- Longer membranes (more windings in filter cylinder) imply more filtration (provided the pump has the ability to push water through it).
- GPD = Gallons per day.
- Aquaguard Reviva 2016 used 75 GPD membrane.

### TDS regulator
- Regulates the water flowing through RO membrane.
- Vids - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0IKcpnndQ)
- Applied to waste water pipe in RO system. 

### Flow restrictor
- When flow restrictor is applied there is water pressure.

### Zero wastage RO
- Pump back rejected water to pipe.
- Have 2 tanks - one to collect rejected water.



## Disinfection
- UV (Ultraviolet filtration)
- Distillation

## Generic Fittings
- john guest push fittings - a ring air-tight seals the connected pipe when the pipe is pushed all the way through. To release, one pushes this ring (by hand or screwdriver). 
- Weight sensor - breaks the circuit of filtration pump when the output tank is filled with water.
