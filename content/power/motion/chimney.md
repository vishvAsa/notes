## Parameters
- Suction power. Should suffice to change air 10 times per hour.
  - Alternate guide: If kitchen is in separate room, 600 m3/h suffices. Else, good to go for 1200 m3/h.
- Size: 60x60 (2-4 burners), 90cm (3-5 burners)
- Autoclean: Better suction power and life.
  - Turbine blower forces air to move to chimney walls (oil goes thence to a collection bowl, which should be washed every month).
  - Thermal auto-clean - evaporate oil etc from insides of motor.
  - Position the motor so that oil goes out directly.
- Filters (with oil collection cup)
  - (Al) Mesh/ Casette filter. Pores need to be cleaned fortnightly.
  - Baffle Filter - Fe or Al beams/ baffles. Clean every 3/4 months.
  - Carbon / Charcoal filter. Deodorizes. Replace every 6 months. 
- Lights: LED.
- Positioning: Wall mounted vs Island
- Duct
  - Chimneys with ducts push air out of the house.
  - Ductless chimneys just pass the air to a charcoal filter and send the air back to the room.
- Maintenance reminders: Buzzer, LED.
