## Desiderata
- Weather resistance - high temperatures, high UV radiation.


## Wire gauge
### Heating circuit 
wire cross section - 4mm². Smaller cross section implies higher resistance, higher heat and consequent damage (melting insulation, plugs etc..). 

### Solar power
- DC cables - use bigger cross sections (4mm²) to minimize losses.
- Inverter to meter cables - at least 6mm². Increase with length.

## Casing
- Protect from water, plastic destroying UV radiation, heat etc..
- UPVC weather resistant pipes for outdoors. available in only few stores and need to be special ordered.
