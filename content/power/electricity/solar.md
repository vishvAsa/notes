## Panels
- 13 deg south slant (considering BLR latitude) to maximize winter production.
- Panel size: 1mtr x 2 mtr = 3.3ft x 6.6ft.
- per kw 60-70 sqft as (prashAnt 2020 BLR)

## Systems:
- On-grid
- Off-grid
- Hybrid

Hybrid and off-grid need battery. Battery costs generally too high. 

### On-grid Cost
- Billing
  - There will be 2 meters: one measuring electricity consumed, another measuring electricity delivered. 
  - Subtraction in the final bill, potentially money back at a certain lower rate (paid annually) for excess electricity delivered.

#### 2020 Returns
- The first Karnataka state solar rooftop policy has come into effect in Oct 2013. This policy was set up by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC). However, the policy came into effect only in 2014 after KERC has listed out the implementation guidelines to all the ESCOMS.
- Tariff amount set for net-metering has changed over time, almost once every year,  and has become Rs 3.07/- as on today for systems below 10 kWp and Rs 3.99/- for systems above 10 kWp.
- Calculations here
- 25 year agreement will be between house owner and BESCOM, usually mediated by vendor
  - Takes 60 days. 
- 65k Rs per 1 KW from https://www.zunroof.com/ .
- Avg generation per KW per day in BLR (considering rain and cloud) 4kWh (as per prashant 2020).
- On-grid costs recoverable in 6 to 7 years. Calculation sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DMpn8-yrXsemJfc-8mtk_6-DIix7Ar4dhyiTmwRx5Cs/edit#gid=0).
