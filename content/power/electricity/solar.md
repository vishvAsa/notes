## Systems:
- On-grid (with 2 way meter)
- On-grid without 2-way meter
- Off-grid
- Hybrid (aka Solar primary)

Hybrid and off-grid need battery. Battery costs generally too high. 

### Circuit details
- Panels (PV cells connected in series) generate DC electricity. Output is 24V or 12V usually.
- Panel output is connected to inverter and then to AC load or bi-directional meter.
- There may be just 1 inverter for all panels (common in off-grid or hybrid systems). Or there may be 1 "micro inverter" per panel (common in on-grid systems).
- Additionally, there may be good lightening arrestor and earthing. 
- Multiple panels connected in parallel may be connected in parallel to a battery and single inverter (in case of hybrid system).

## Panels
- 13 deg south slant (considering BLR latitude) to maximize winter production.
- Panel size: 1mtr x 2 mtr = 3.3ft x 6.6ft.
- per kw 60-70 sqft as (prashAnt 2020 BLR)
- Avg generation per KW per day in BLR (considering rain and cloud) 4kWh (as per prashant 2020).
- Annual degradation (as of 2020 tech) - 0.0045x annually (to be compounded during calculation).


## Inverters
- See separate page

## On-grid BLR Cost
- Billing
  - There will be 2 meters (or 1 bidirectional meter): one measuring electricity consumed, another measuring electricity delivered. 
  - Subtraction in the final bill, potentially money back at a certain lower rate (paid annually) for excess electricity delivered.
- Excess units of current generated during summer will be accumulated. Some of these excess units will be used in cloudy season. Leftover will be purchased annually by BESCOM.
- If grid power is down - solar power generation will not be sent to grid. 

### 2020 Returns
- The first Karnataka state solar rooftop policy has come into effect in Oct 2013. This policy was set up by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC). However, the policy came into effect only in 2014 after KERC has listed out the implementation guidelines to all the ESCOMS.
- Calculations and comparisons [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DMpn8-yrXsemJfc-8mtk_6-DIix7Ar4dhyiTmwRx5Cs/edit#gid=0).
    - On-grid costs recoverable in 7 years. 
- 25 year agreement will be between house owner and BESCOM, usually mediated by vendor
  - Takes up to 60 days. If assistant engineer (AE) and provider have good understanding - can be done in 20-25 days.
