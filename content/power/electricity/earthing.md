- TN-S - most common in older housing stock, with supplier providing a separate earth conductor back to the substation. 
- TN-C-S - (Protective Multiple Earthing) Supply combines neutral and earth, but they are separated out in the installation. More common in newer houses. 
- TT -  No earth provided by supplier; installation requires its own earth rod etc.
- TN-C - No separate earth conductors anywhere - neutral used as earth throughout supply and installation (very rarely used).
- IT - Supply is e.g. portable generator with no earth connection, installation supplies own earth rod.
