## Intro
- Switches are put on top of switch boxes (often embedded within walls) covered by a panel and perhaps a frame.
- Switch box sizes are: 2M/ model/ module (accommodates 2 switches), 6M, 8M, 12M, 18M. 

## Wifi switch
- Connects to Google Home or Alexa. Good for scheduled powering.
- Tinxy installation video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcRZbpv0d9o). Loads less than 1kW ok.
- Wiring: AC input is provided to the switch. Then, phase wires are sent from the switch to the loads (which will have neutral wiring separately). Then, switches are connected to the module (no AC current here).
