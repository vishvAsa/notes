## Intro
Compiled language. Has garbage collection. Type checked. Functions as values.

### Negatives
- No operator overloading.
- Go is not meant to innovate programming theory. It's meant to innovate programming practice.	
- No type hierarchy. Can have interfaces.
- For user defined classes, this is not a problem. One can use embedding.
- Deliberate focus on simplicity.
- No operator overloading.
