## Distinctive features
This is an interpreted language. It is loosely typed.

It is very good at text processing.

### Richness of syntax
It is very rich, so that there are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing; to the point where code written by one programmer may be unintelligible to another.

## Running, building
### Running
See perlrun on the internet. Commands to be interpreted are either entered in a special shell, or is passed in a file to the interpreter, or is passed in the command line.

### Getting help
Use perldoc, perlsyn. Inbuilt function reference: perlfunc.
