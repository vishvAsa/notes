## Derandomization
Design algorithm which uses random choices; Replace random choice with choice which maximizes conditional expectation; Eg: find \\(\geq \frac{|E|}{2}\\) cut in G=(V, E). Devise rand alg which uses n 2-wise ind bits; enumerate all values for \\(\log n\\) truly ind bits, make n 2-wise ind bits and run rand alg.

## Explicit construction algorithms
Sample values for some variables, show that desired object still exists, use exhaustive search for other variables.

## Sampling uniformly from unit sphere
Pick each point according to \\(N(0, n^{-1})\\). \why
