## Bottom up solution
Aka Divide and conquer. A bottom-up way of constructing the solution. 

This includes Dynamic programming, which is discussed in the Optimization survey.

### Time Analysis
\tbc

## Greedy algorithms
Eg: shortest path algorithm.

### The matroid
This is a pair: (Set, Independence property). Eg: (vertices, Independent sets in a graph). There are efficient algorithms for finding the maximal indpendent subset. So, often sufficient to specify the problem using the matroid formalism.
