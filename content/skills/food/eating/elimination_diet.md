## A meat base
> The main reason a Carnivore Diet heals is that it cuts out all food sensitivities in the diet, not that all non-ASF (animal sourced food) is bad. People who have a wide sensitivity to plants benefit because it cuts out all potential food triggers. Meat is the least problematic food group. Carnivory works to reduce inflammation, autoimmune conditions and gut issues. Essentially, only eating meat is an elimination diet â€“ and elimination diets work. Take the base diet & expand from there. There is no need to personalise the base. - GA
