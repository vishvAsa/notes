## Child-directed schools
- The approach is to not teach, but to assist the child in learning and empower each child to become a better learner and to learn on its own. Freedom is provided to learn what the child is interested in. Freedom is provided to learn to the levels that a child is interested in and capable of.

  - Basavanagudi, Bangalore took shape in 2013
  - Supposedly costly.
  - Children periodically visit and stay in a campus in the outskirts of Bangalore. In this environ, in addition to learning activities, they manage their day-to-day activities, help in cooking, cleaning and tend to the plants, trees and vegetables being grown.
  - Samvida will host children until the age of 17 years. That is when a child becomes eligible to write the board examinations, which are recognised world over. Our students will appear for these exams as private candidates. We are confident that our students will perform to their potential in these competitive exams.
  - Samvida is supported by Prayoga (http://[www.prayoga.org.in](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.prayoga.org.in&sa=D&ust=1565281940548000)) for Science Learning. Children learn Science in a hands-on way by doing experiments.
  - several learning facilitators at Samvida are parents. “Currently, we are welcoming partnerships from parents whose children are between ages 6 and 12.”
