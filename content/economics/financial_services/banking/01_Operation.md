## Capital

Bank owners make an investment - this is called the capital. A part of the bank’s capital goes towards increasing the size of the capital.

## Liabilities/ Borrowed money

They also borrow money from investors - in other words, investors deposit money in a bank. The bank promises a return on investment to the depositor, but this return on investment is but a part of the profit the bank makes using that money.

The amount of money added to the deposit (principal) is called the interest. The amount of interest accrued per dollar per year may be specified using an interest rate/ fraction.

### Compounding

Interest is often compounded ie added to the principal with a certain frequency- daily or monthly or quarterly or annually. For fluid accounts - where the deposited money varies daily, interest is calculated on the money available in the deposit account for each day and is added to the principal/ compounded usually at a lower frequency - eg: quarterly.

When interest is compounded, a number called ’annual percentage yield’ (APY) may be used to specify compound interest accrued per dollar per year. Or, one may simply specify the simple interest which, together with the compounding frequency, determines the compound interest: In case it varies (and is applied) daily, this simple interest is often stated as 7-day yield.

## Assets/ Lent money

Banks lend money and get a greater amount of money, determined by a rate of interest, by some time - usually in installments. They sometimes tend to make other investments too.

The bank’s assets may be liquid or illiquid (eg: mortgages for houses when the real estate prices are falling).

The assets may be good or toxic, depending on their risk/ projected/ current return on investment.

With risky lending (ie: where the probability of default is higher than usual), the bank charges a higher rate of interest in order to mitigate the risk by purchasing or acting as insurance against default.

## Balance sheet

The bank should be capable of returning the money to the depositors whenever they demand it - as long as they do not do it all at once (a ’run on the bank’). So, always lent money <= borrowed money + capital. In order for the bank to be making the maximum possible safe profit, this should hold: lent money/ investments = borrowed money + capital. Banks for which this holds are said to be solvent.
