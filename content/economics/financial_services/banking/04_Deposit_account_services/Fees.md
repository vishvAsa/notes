+++

Some banks may charge fees for their services, which are often waived if the customer has certain minimum deposits. Others may provide these services for free in order to beat competition, and to reduce workload of having to provide manual service at branches.

## Service quality trade-off

Compared with Small/ local/ cooperative/ internet only banks/ credit unions, Large banks usually have the advantage of having a large ATM network and slicker online banking/ remote deposit systems.

But, large banks have the disadvantage of levying heavier fees, lower deposit interest rates, higher loan interest rates, worse customer service.

### Advantageous combination

An high yield savings or money market account (perhaps in a credit union) with a checking account in a large bank; and ACH transfers set up between them.
