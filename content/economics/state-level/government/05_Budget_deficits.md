title = "05 Budget deficits"

+++

Many cities, states and countries outside have greater expenditure than revenue, a gap which is often projected to widen as time passes.

## Quantification

Government deficit is often measured as a percentage of the GDP, which is much larger than the actual income of the government alone. Anything over 10% is considered too high.

## Expectations without willingness to spend

Often people expect unrealistically good public services from the government, without the willingness to spend a proportionate fraction of their income. So, politicians in many countries are elected based on promise to increase or maintain public services while reducing (rather than increasing) taxation - this results in the perpetuation of a budget crisis.

This is especially the case in countries where the affected taxpayers have significant say in choosing their rulers.

## Long term solution

The long term solution involves reducing expenditures (downsizing government services), increased taxation, later retirement age etc..

### Increase burden on the rich

In the case of democracies and socialist countries, one solution is to place a higher tax burden on the rich. But, people in countries characterized by a phobia of socialism or by general optimism where people are rich or expect to become rich, this is rejected.

## Short term solution

Temporary measures to combat it include borrowing money by issuing bonds, or, in the case of countries - creating money as explained elsewhere.

### Sovereign debt

Treasury bonds are issued by national governments to borrow money, they return the principal with a very small interest.

## Defaults

Sovereign debt is generally considered to be very secure - as the government can repay debt under normal circumstances by printing new money.

But in some cases, the country is so indebted that printing money will lead to currency devaluation/ inflation with very bad socio-economic consequences. So, sometimes countries default on their commitment to pay back debtors.

### Default Consequences

When a government defaults on its debts, it can only acquire loans under much harsher, tougher conditions.

### Rescue

Troubled governments, not wanting to default - or wanting to default gracefully, are often rescued by friendly countries/ organizations like IMF and EU lending money, under conditions which discourage future budget deficits - such as raising interest rates on future government bonds, and other long-term solutions mentioned earlier
