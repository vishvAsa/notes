Businesses, left to themselves, often operate to increase their own profit at the expense of the environment and the general economy.

Regulation about working conditions are described in another chapter.

## Competition promotion

Governments then try to ensure that no company gets a monopoly on any market, as monopoly reduces progress and keeps the prices up.

### Illegal activities

#### Disadvantaging competition

Microsoft, in the 1990â€™s, bundling the internet explorer browser with its operating system, disadvantaged rival browsers and gained monopoly.

#### Cartel formation

Treating customers as the enemy, and competitors as partners, companies collude and resolve not to compete with each other by amicably dividing up the market and fixing the price. This drains customer money, and decreases GDP growth.

Eg: In 1995, a handful of American, Korean and Japanese manufacturers of lysene colluded to fix the price; were exposed and were fined.

#### Interoperability prevention

Microsoft was fined by EU for not providing adequate documentation for the various protocols used by its products.
