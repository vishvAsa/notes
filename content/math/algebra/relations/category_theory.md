## Abstraction
Aka general abstract nonsense. Abstract from sets and relations to categories and morphisms.

## Category
(Class ob(C) of objects, morphisms or arrows hom(C), composition op: \\(\cdot\\)) with \\(\cdot\\) identity, associative \\(\cdot\\). Category Eg: Set, \\(Vect_{k}\\).

Small category: aka CAT: both ob(C) and hom(C) are sets, rather than classes.

## Morphisms
Homomorphism: A structure (identity, inverse elements, and binary ops) preserving funciton f: f(x)=3x preserves addition. Isomorphism: both f and \\(f^{-1}\\) are homomorphisms. Endomorphism: homomorphism of a mathematical object to itself. Automorphism is both isomorphism and an endomorphism.

## Functors
Structure preserving mapping between categories and their morphisms.
