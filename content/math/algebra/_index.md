## Intro
- 'Algebra about strucure and equalities. Analysis about inequalities.' 
- Research themes: Properties of various algebraic objects, their relationships.
- Characterization of research effort: See linear algebra survey, complexity theory survey.

## Techniques
- Algebra is about correct reasoning: symbol manipulation according to some rules.
- It is about abstraction by means of techniques such as **change of variables**.
- Look for structure in expressions, understand and if necessary, abstract away sub-expressions with new variables: very important! +++(5)+++
- Use properties of algebraic objects well, keep a list of such properties  handy.

### Common proof techniques
- Induction. Direct inference. 
- Contradiction:
  - Diagonalization- Order all elements, make a new element which differs from every other element.
