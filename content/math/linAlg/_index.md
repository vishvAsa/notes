### Linear algebra over field F
Vector space over field F with all linear transformations.

## Themes
Linear transformations and matrices; their properties. Systems of linear equations. Using decompotions to understand the operation of linear maps better.

### Related surveys
For info on vectors, vector spaces, various functionals (including norms), non-linear functions: see survey of vector spaces, their functions and functionals.

For numerical analysis, conditioning, stability, differnce equations, differential equations: see Numerical analysis ref.


## Characterization of research effort
See algorithms ref; Both strategies mentioned there are useful.

Experiment with Matlab.

### Matrix algorithm design
The decompoisitional approach to matrix computations is extremely useful. Think of a computation in terms of triangular, diagonal, orthogonal etc.. decompositions. Facilitates error analysis.

### Working with algebra
Invlolves much algebra in addition. Reasoning about matrix operations: Understand what is going on by the use of algebra; eg: write scaling rows of \\(A\\) as DA where D is diagonal. Write special matrices algebraically. This highly clarifies things, makes them unambiguous. This is an important skill.

Use induction a lot.
