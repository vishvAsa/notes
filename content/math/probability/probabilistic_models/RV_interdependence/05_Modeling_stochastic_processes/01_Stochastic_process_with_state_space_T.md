Aka random process. T-valued random variable/ state sequence indexed by \\(r\in R\\) (often time): visualize as a time-series - a directed graph which is a straight line.

## Multiple coin toss processes
Consider a sequence of coin tosses. Let \\(X_i\\) model the outcome of the i-th toss.

Bernoulli process: iid bernoulli trials: the same coin is tossed multiple times, that is \\(\forall i: X_i \distr p\\). Resulting from such a process is the Binomial distribution for \\(\sum_i X_i\\).

Poisson trials: independent but not necessarily identically distributed trials, that is \\(X_i \distr p_i\\).

## Continuous time
Aka flow. \tbc
