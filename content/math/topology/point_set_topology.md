## Motivation
Coffee cup and donut are geometrically different, but topologically same: isotopes! Can deform one to the other. Generalize notions of convergence, connectedness, continuity.

## The topological space
Set of points or Topological space X. Topology T: Class of some sets of points closed under \\(\union, \inters\\).

Sets \\(S_{i}\\) in T are said to be open. \\(S_{i}'\\) are closed sets. Neighborhood of p is a set \\(V \supset\\) open set \\(U \ni p\\). Similarly define nbd of set S of points. \\(A \in X\\) is dense if any nbd has some \\(a\in A\\).

Spanning set (of sets); its linear span. Basis of topology.

## Topological Morphisms
Every 'object' in \\(Y\\) is a continuous function \\(f: \\)X\\( \to Y\\), where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are topological spaces. A tea-cup is a function to \\(R^{3}\\).

### Homotopy
Take 2 objects/ cont functions \\(f, g: \\)X\\( \to Y\\). Homotopy is continuous function \\(H:X \times [0, 1] \to Y\\), with \\(H(x, 0) = f; H(x, 1) = g\\). Think of second parameter as time, and H as a continuous deformation.

If \\(H(x,t)\\) is also 1:1, \\(H\\) is an isotopy.

### Continuous morphism
f(x) neighborhood corresponds to x neighborhood.

### Homeomorphism
A bicontinuous fn: \\(X \to Y\\). Respects topological properties.

## Knots
A circular piece of thread. The simple ring or the unknot. The trefoil. Sketching knots. Strands: segments involved in a cross-over.

## The 3 Reidemeister moves
See wikipedia article for figures. Sufficient and necessary to produce any valid deformation possible from a starting configuration.

### Knot invariants
Property invariant to the Reidemesiter moves. 3 colorability of strands: Can assign 3 colors to strands such that all 3 colors are used; at each crossing, 3 or 1 colors seen.
