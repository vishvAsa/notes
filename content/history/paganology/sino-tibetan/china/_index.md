## Inner and outer coat
### Outer imitation
- "chIna-s are exquisitely responsive to the language of power and often imitate the dominant cultures in their outer coats chIna-s are exquisitely responsive to the language of power and often imitate the dominant cultures in their outer coats"
  - "In the Tang period the chIna-s were fascinated by everything Turkic their great emperor having turkic blood and married into turkic ancestry. Thus they imitated a lot of Turkic "fashion". At the same time, in the religious bauddham became a fashion. Yet despite these outer coats the inner chInatvam was strong."

([T0](https://storify.com/dawdlerMe/on-legalism?utm_campaign&utm_content=storify-pingback&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&awesm=sfy.co_r0jGg), [T1](https://twitter.com/vvkbkvv/status/517093851623075840), [T2](https://twitter.com/vvkbkvv/status/528002893023293440).)

### Ideas
- Human behavior must be controlled by strictly imposed laws.
- Unswerving loyalty to the ruler of the state is a top priority.
    - Whatever contributes to the states power and orderliness should be deemed right.
- Rejection of Confician ethics to which even monarchs must adhere.
- Rejection of inherited official position. Rely on military-style merit instead.

### Strengthening the state.
- Focus on food production and military buildup.
- Absorption of confucian hierarchical ideas
    - "The Legalist-Confucian combination can be seen as an appropriation of Confucian ideals by power-holders who are quite willing to ignore the moral demands of the doctrine and settle, instead, for an emphasis on authority and hierarchy. From the time of the Han dynasty this amalgamation was known as Yangru, Yinfa- 阳儒阴法 - which could be translated as Confucianism as the bright yang outside, and Legalism as the dark yin inside. " 
    - Distinction from confucianism: [Mao1](https://i.imgur.com/tNETsQz.jpg).
- Implementation
    - Chin Shi Huang-di who built the wall and combined it with the terror of genocidal slaughters \[a fact much admired by Mao in recent times\]; the rulers of the Han dynasty thereafter built huge infantry forces and fortified settlements.
