### Prelude
- Panthay 17 yr rebellion with heavy Mohammedan element, overlapped with Dungan jihad.

### Crushing and costly defeat
- "Dungan revolt: 8-12 mill dead, lasted 15 yrs,sullas prob around 10% of Qing : 32-48 mill or more dead(Indian pop 4X Qing & sulla % higher)" \[TW\] 
- Zuo reported 60K of 700K Shaanxi Mohammedans left. "Among those fortunate to survive this catastrophe, some had relocated ... while others were forced to abandon their religion and become part of today's Han people". Islam in Shaanxi was completely destroyed as a result of the policy of “demolishing Hui” in the late Qing Dynasty. ([TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/972870662023860224))
- "(80% of sullas in empire died when curbing Dungan, Panthay etc)." \[TW\]
- Qing punishment for sons & grandsons of Yaqub Beg: castration \[[TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/710988882742005760)\].
- Economic and social restrictions
  - \[[TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/471303134216998912)\]
  - "All our villages, farms, houses and graveyards were now owned by those from other religions. More than eight hundred mosques were destroyed by fire." - [TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/972871308919808001/photo/1)
  - "Their mosques were either damaged or destroyed by fire, or converted to family shrines and temples of the Han people." [TW](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/972870662023860224)


### Further jihAd-s
- "They didn't stop @ Dungan either, there was Dungan 2 in 1894-96 (during Japan-Qing war), TIRET in 1930's (syrian ghazi Tawfiq Bay), Ili in 40's."
- Muslim Conflict in Gansu was when a coalition of Muslim Generals broke out in revolt against the Guominjun in 1927.

## Ngolok rebellion
- a series of military campaigns against unconquered Ngolok (Golok) tribal Tibetan areas of Qinghai (Amdo), undertaken by two Hui commanders, Gen. Ma Qi and Gen. Ma Bufang, on behalf of the Beiyang and Kuomintang governments of the Republic of China.
- "After ethnic rioting between Hui and Tibetans erupted in 1918, Ma Qi defeated the Tibetans. He heavily taxed the town for eight years. In 1925 a rebellion broke out, and thousands of Tibetans drove out the Hui. Ma Qi responded with 3,000 Hui Chinese troops, who retook Labrang and machine-gunned thousands of Tibetan monks as they tried to flee.\[5\] Ma Qi besieged Labrang numerous times but the Tibetans and Mongols fiercely resisted his Hui forces until Ma Qi gave it up in 1927.\[6\] However, that was not the last Labrang saw of Gen. Ma. The Hui forces looted and ravaged the monastery again. In revenge Tibetan Nomads skinned alive many hui soldiers. One of the most common practice was to slice open the stomach of a still alive soldier and than put hot rock inside the stomach. Many hui women were sold to the ethnic Han and Kazakhs. Children were adopted by the Tibetans."

### Later repurcussions
- "Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. "

## Under japanese
- "Soldiers smeared mosques with pork fat, forced Hui to butcher pigs to feed soldiers and forced young women to serve as sex slaves under the pretense of training them as geishas and singers. Hui cemeteries were destroyed. Many Hui [fought against Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Muslims_in_the_Second_Sino-Japanese_war). "
