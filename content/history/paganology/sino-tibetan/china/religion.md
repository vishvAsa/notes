## Recent trajectory
The communist party tried to eradicate religion starting from the cultural revolution - they tortured monks, destroyed monasteries. But this ceased in 1982. After economic growth in the 1990â€™s, recognizing a popular feeling of spiritual emptiness, the party promoted religion as an important part of developing a harmonious society, provided they support the party. Those that disagree are suppressed: Eg: Falun Gong, Catholic Church, some Tibetian Buddhism.
