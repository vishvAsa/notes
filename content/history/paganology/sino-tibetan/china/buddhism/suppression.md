The below heavily draws from @porbotialora's account.

## Xianbei campaigns
- The 1st one was in 446 and was driven by Daoists. Daoism was made into the state religion and Buddhism was outlawed and Buddhist monks and clerics were massacred by the army and Buddhist temples, idols and books were destroyed. This was by a Xianbei emperor who was converted to Daoism by Kou Qianzhi, a Han who was Heavenly master of the northern Heavenly Master sect of Daoism (unlike the southern based one of the Zhang family).
- The second one was in 567 and was driven by Confucians. An ex-Buddhist cleric  complained about Buddhism to the emperor and called for it to be outlawed. The emperor set up a debate between Confucians, Buddhists and Daoists. At the debate, Buddhists and Daoists immediately started attacking each other severely so the emperor was disgusted and ordered Buddhism and Daoism both to be outlawed, their idols smashed and forced clerics to secularize and seized temple lands. This one did not involve massacres. The emperor promoted Confucianism.
  - This was done by the Xianbei emperor after he received the message by a Han ex-Buddhist cleric who wrote to him on why Buddhism should be banned so he ended up banning both Buddhism and Daoism because of the debate.

## Han campaigns
It affected northern china, particularly the Guanzhong area three and four persecutions were done by Han dynasty (Tang emperors were Han on their paternal side which determined their ethnicity).

- The third Buddhist persecution was in 846 by the Tang emperor Wuzong and was driven by Daoists. The emperor made Daoism the state religion and baned Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism and Chrsitianity and ordered their temples and churches destroyed, their clerics, monks and nuns forced to go back to secular life, and to destroy and melt down their idols and confiscate their wealth.
- The fourth one was in 955 becasue the emperor needed copper so he had Buddha statues melted down and ordered Buddhist monks and nuns executed if they tried to evade it.

There was also an unsuccesful attempt in 819 by Confucian scholar Han Yu to get the emperor to ban Buddhism. He called the Buddha's fingerbone "filthy" and demanded it be destroyed and called Buddha a barbarian. He criticized Daoism too for it's theology which he was against  but said that Daoism was not barbarian unlike Buddhism.


## Ming times
Although the Ming Hongwu emperor was apparently from a Mahayana Buddhist background, he ordered strict controls over all religions and clerics including Buddhism and had Mount Putuo's Buddhist temples destroyed and evacuated to combat piracy (not for religious reasons).

The early Ming emperors from Hongwu to the mid-Ming outwardly patronized Vajrayana Tibetan lamas for the same reason as the Qing emperors, to control Mongol tribes and some say the Ming and Qing deliberately help promote Vajrayana Buddhism among Mongols for negative affects it had on Mongol society and culture. The early Ming emperors kept the Vajrayana Lamas in their imperial palace and just like the Qing emperors, they never tried to convert their own people to it, strictly limiting their access to a small group of people including the emperor (giving credence to the thought that they helped Tibetans spread it to Mongols for negative effect on Mongols like making them weak). Qing emperors kept ordinary Manchus away from Vajrayana Buddhism and had them worship Shamanism as their religion and read Confucian books.

Halfway into the Ming dynasty, the Ming Jiajing emperor was openly Daoist and then he ordered all Buddhist establishments including Vajrayana ones in the imperial palace to be shut down and closed.

Ming princes from cadet branches of the family in the provinces away from the capital tended to convert from Buddhism to orthodox Daoism and patronize orthodox Daoist sects and orders an even marry their daughters off to members of the Zhang clan who controlled the Heavenly Master sect of Daoism. These Ming princes wrote books on Daoism and religion and attacked and criticized Buddhism.

Ming Prince Zhu Quan was one of those who converted to orthodox Daoism and attacked Buddhism in his works. He hated Buddhism and wrote extensively on Daoist sects and how to carry out orthodox Daoist rituals and worship and attacked Buddhism all over his book 原始秘書. He called Buddhism a "mourning cult", praising emperors who persecuted Buddhism, attacking emperors who patronized Buddhism and said a monarch who worshipped Buddha would destroy his country. He also wrote a book on Daoism, 天皇至道太清玉册.


## Qing times
In the Qing dynasty, there was also tension between Manchu and Daur shamanists against Buddhism. Manchu language stories like Tale of the Nisan Shamanness composed by the Daur presented Tibetan Vajrayana Lamaism as evil and an opponent of the traditional shamanistic religion. Daur were part of the Manchu banners.

Only the Qing imperial family dealt with Buddhist deities at their shamanic rituals, but ordinary Manchus kept away from Buddhism and instead worshipped Guandi in their shamanic rituals. Guandi was a Han general from the Three Kingdoms period who was deified
and became a god of war and also worshippedi n Daoism. Manchus adopted worship of him from Han military garrisons of Liaodong during the Ming.

The Qing emphasized martial culture and war for rank and file ordinary Manchu bannermen, hence their adoption of the Han war god Guandi, while keeping them away from the Buddha. And translating Confucian classics into Manchu (Confucianism promotes archery as one of the six arts and archery was also revered by Manchus).
