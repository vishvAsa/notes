## Robust intellectual response to Christianity
- The neo-platonist tradition and lineage is described in [the platonist page](../philosophy/platonism/).

## Christian appropriation
- Appropriation of classical (hellenic) thought
  - socrates, plato etc.. were excellent polytheists.
  - "a man (Socrates) who by his own testimony was on a mission from Apollon."
- "Through Augustine (354–430) in the West and the 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus) in the East as well as the pseudo-epigraphic writings of Dionysius the Areopagite (early 6th century), Neoplatonism profoundly influenced the emergence of mainstream and not so mainstream Christian theology (John Scotus Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart). In addition, by way of a pseudo-epigraphical treatise entitled Theology of Aristotle, Neoplatonic thought facilitated the integration of ancient philosophy and science into both Islam (especially through Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi and Avicenna [Ibn Sina]) and Judaism (Maimonides)."
