## Paganism
### Present

- Khanty of Rus: " Khanty people remained heathen for long despite vigorous attempts to impose the Christian delusion on them by the Rus. They were finally subjugated by the 1800s and partly converted. In the 1900s they were subject to ethnic cleansing by Stalin who systematically suppressed their heathen religion and killed off all their shamans."
- Mari people of Rus.

Residual awareness of obliteration of the better pagan heritage

> Hegel the German \[[IMG](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/578532934673518593)\]: "Is Judaea, then, the Teutons’ fatherland?" ([CH](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pc/ch02.htm))
> "Christianity has emptied Valhalla, felled the sacred groves, extirpated the national imagery as a shameful superstition, as a devilish poison, and given us instead the imagery of a nation whose climate, laws, culture, and interests are strange to us and whose history has no connection whatever with our own. A David or a Solomon lives in our popular imagination, but our country’s own heroes slumber in learned history books.... Anyone who did not know the history of the city, the culture, and the laws of Athens could almost have learned them from the festivals if he had lived a year within its gates... Athenian citizen whose poverty deprived him of the chance to vote in the public assembly, or who even had to sell himself as a slave, still knew as well as Pericles and Alcibiades who Agamemnon and Oedipus were when Sophocles or Euripides brought them on the stage."


In Nietzsche's writings: 

> The two opposing values ‘good and bad’, ‘good and evil’ have fought a terrible battle for thousands of years on earth; and  although the latter has been dominant for a long time, there is still no lack of places where the battle remains undecided. ...   
    So the Romans were the strong and noble, stronger and nobler than anybody hitherto who had lived or been dreamt of on earth; their every relic and inscription brings delight, provided one can guess what it is that is doing the writing there. By contrast, the Jews were a priestly nation of ressentiment par excellence, possessing an unparalleled genius for popular morality: compare peoples with similar talents, such as the Chinese or the Germans, with the Jews, and you will realize who are first rate and who are fifth. Which of them has prevailed for the time being, Rome or Judea? But there is no trace of doubt: just consider to whom you bow down in Rome itself, today, as though to the embodiment of the highest values – and not just in Rome, but over nearly half the earth \[[N1](https://archive.org/stream/GeneologyofMorals#page/n71/mode/2up)\]
