## arumuka nalavAr
[arumuka nalavAr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arumuka_Navalar), the dvaita saiddhAntika shaiva, a brAhmaNa in deed despite not being born in the brAhmaNa-jAti, reprimanded the brAhmaNas of TN for the rate at which they were giving up the veda, who produced vigorous critiques of the Christianity and impeded missionary activity.
    - "Born as an ornament of the highly cultured and refined shaiva vELALa-s, he grew up to become a scholar in both tamizh and saMskRta. He provided highly refined poetic, Tamil translations of quotes from saMskRta purANas. He was also highly competent in English, using that knowledge to study and master the the durAgama of both the Christians and yahudas. He teamed up with his friend and student who was learning Tamil from him, senthilnAtha iyer and published bibiliya kutsitam (disgusting things in the Bible)"
    - He was so respected that dharmapura AdhInam, who used to pay worship mainly to the caturtha guru parampara and shiva and did not focus much on tirumALigai dEvar (a brAhmaNa and author of one of many books of the shaiva Tamil canon), heeded his gentle reprimand and got proper respects to be offered to dEvar
    - he challenged vaLLalAr, even sued him...and even after he had passed away, he still had great influence. He had managed to create a pool of sufficiently charges orthodox shaivas who managed to prevent vaLLalAr cultists from installing his statues  at mainstream shaivAgama temples
