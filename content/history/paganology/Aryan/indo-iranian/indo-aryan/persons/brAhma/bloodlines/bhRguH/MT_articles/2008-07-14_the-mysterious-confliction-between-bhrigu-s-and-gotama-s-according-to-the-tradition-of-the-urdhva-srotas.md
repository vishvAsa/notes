## Vedic regard
In the Rgveda the gotama-s repeatedly and respectfully mention the
bhRgu-s as the founders of the fire rite, which is consonant with
their position at the head of the shrauta gotra-pravara lists.  
For example:  

> dadhuSh TvA bhRgavo mAnuSheShvA rayiM na chAruM suhavaM janebhyaH |  
hotAram agne atithiM vareNyaM mitraM na shevaM divyAya janmane ||RV
1.58.6  

Here nodhA gautama declares that the bhRgu-s first established the
ritual fire in the midst of men. In fact nodhA gautama goes ahead to
mention this act of the bhRgu-s again in RV 1.60.1:  
vahniM yashasaM vidathasya ketuM suprAvyaM dUtaM sadyo-artham |  
dvi-janmAnaM rayim iva prashastaM rAtiM bharad bhRgave mAtarishvA ||  
Here the transmission of the ritual fire from mAtarishvan to bhRgu,
the first founder of the rite amongst men is mentioned.  
The other gautama, kakShivAn dairghatamasa, also mentions the bhRgu-s
in positive light:  

> pra yA ghoShe bhRgavANe na shobhe yayA vAchA yajati pajriyo vAm |  
praiShayurna vidvAn || RV 1.120.5  

Here he compares his own chant to the ashvinau to that of the
bhRgu-s.  

His father dirghatamAH auchAthya states:  

> yamerire bhRgavo vishvavedasaM nAbhA pRthivyA bhuvanasya majmanA |  
agniM taM gIrbhirhinuhi sva A dame ya eko vasvo varuNo na rAjati || RV
1.143.3  

Here he states that the mighty bhRgu-s first established the fire
sacrifice in the nave of the earth.  

A similar view is also shared by the other great vipra amongst the
gotama-s, vAmadeva gautama:  

> ayam iha prathamo dhAyi dhAtRbhir hotA yajiShTho adhvareShv IDyaH |  
yam apnavAno bhRgavo viruruchur vaneShu chitraM vibhvaM vishe-vishe ||
RV4.7.1  

and  

> AshuM dUtaM vivasvato vishvA yash charShaNIr abhi |  
A jabhruH ketum Ayavo bhRgavANaM vishe-vishe ||RV 4.7.4  
Here, apnavAna and his bhRgu-s are described as having initiated the
fire rite that spread throughout the peoples.  

vAmadeva gautama also states:  

> eved indrAya vRShabhAya vRShNe brahmAkarma bhRgavo na rathaM |  
nU chid yathA naH sakhyA viyoShad asan na ugro .avitA tanUpAH || RV
4.16.20  

Here, vAmadeva says that he fashions a hymn for indra even as the
bhRgu-s had made a car. Earlier in the same same sUkta vAmadeva states
that he is fashioning a hymn for indra even as the bhArgava ushanAH
kAvya had done in the past. Thus from all accounts in the Rgveda it
appear that the gotama-s like their other a\~Ngirasa cousins the kaNva-s
and bharadvAja-s considered the bhRgu-s as their models, and founders
of their ritual system.

## Purana rivalry episode
Given this vedic precedence I was puzzled by a short paurANic narrative
provided by the siddhAnta tantra, mRgendra’s vidyApAda (13.102-105)
regarding the Pauranic dvIpa known as gomeda:

gomede gopatir nAma rAjAbhUd gosavodyataH ||  
yAjyo .abhUd vahni kalpAnAm autathyAnAM manoH kule |  
In gomeda there was a king named gopati who wanted to perform the
gosava. The ritual was performed by the autathya-s (i.e. the
Epic/Pauranic form of the vedic name auchAthya or the descendents of
dIrghatamas the founding father of the gautama-s) who were like fire.

sa teShu hari yajnAya pravRtteShu bhRgUn gurUn ||  
vavre taM gautamaH kopAd ashapad agamat kShayam |  
He chose the bhRgu-s as his officiants while \[the gotama-s\] were
performing a hari ritual \[soma ritual, taken by some as a ritual to
viShNu\]. The gautama out of anger cursed him and he went to his
destruction.

yajnavATe .asya tA gAvo dagdhAH kopAgninA muneH ||  
tan medasA mahI channA gomedaH sa tato .abhavat |  
The cows in the ritual enclosure were burnt by the flames of brAhmaNa-s
wrath. The earth was convered by the fat of those cows and dvIpa gomedah
came to be known.

The persistence of this tale in the shaiva world became clear from its
presence in an abbreviated form in the parAkhya tantra (D. Goodall
edition):  

Gomedas tat paraM dvIpaM yatra gautama-shApataH |  
gavAM shate hate medaH pravRtaM prachurAt tadA || (parAkhya 5.102)  
Beyond that is gomedas where a hundred cows were killed because of the
curse of gautama and their fat flowed out profusely \[forming the
continent\].

This conflict between the gautama-s and bhRgu-s nor the king gopati is
mentioned in any other paurANic source. I suspect that it is one of
those rare cases where the paurANic material within the tantra-s is
preserving something absent in the classical tantra-s themselves. In
this sense it would compare to the paurANic material found in the
kubjikA-matA and ShaT-sAhasra. Its antecedents are indeed puzzling. The
brAhmaNa narratives of the gosava mention the ritualist being sprinkled
with cow milk – it may be performed by a vaishya or a sthapati who is
elected as a governor by his people. This gopati could be such a
character as no such king figures in the major paurANic or vedic
genealogies.
