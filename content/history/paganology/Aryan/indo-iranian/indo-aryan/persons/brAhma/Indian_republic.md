## Pandit Narendra Dev Shastri
a Sanskrit scholar originally from Lahore, student of raghu-vIra, aided the thought-consolidation balinese hinduism.
    - "come to Bali by chance and that, to his surprise, he had discovered that the Balinese were Hindus like himself, even though they had for-gotten most of what Hinduism was about, a result of being kept in ignorance of religious matters by their priests. Thus he decided to bring the Balinese back in to the fold of Hinduism, for fear that if they persisted along their natural inclination,which is animism, they would become an easy prey to proselytizing, not so much by Muslims but by Christians—and worse, communists’."

## malhotra-rAjIva of Princeton New Jersey
who vigorously produced and funded books and a "svadeshi indology" movement to expose the influential and insidious mechanism of mlecCha indologist scholars, church organizations and leftist press. This despite some personal flaws - misplaced arrogance, alienating allies. Some would say: "ya ya he's not as revolutionary as he claims - many have critiqued mlecCha indology". But fact is that the malla's efforts are the most vigorous - even at the socio-political level beyond the academe.
