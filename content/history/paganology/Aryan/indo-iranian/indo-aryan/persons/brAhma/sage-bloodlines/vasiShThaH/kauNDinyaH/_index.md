### काम्बोजदेशराजा
> The sovereign of Fu-nan was originally a queen called Lieu-ye(Soma). There was a person named Huen-tien (Kaundinya) of Mo-fu. He was a staunch devotee of a Brahminical god who pleased with his piety. He dreamt that the god gave him a divine bow and asked him to take to see in a trading vessel. In the morning he went to the temple of god and found a bow. Then he embarked on a trading vessel and the god changed the course of wind in such a manner that he came to Fun-nan. Lieu-ye the queen of Fu-nan came in a boat to plunder the trading vessel. Kaundinya raised his bow and shot an arrow which pierced through the queen’s boat from one side to the other. The queen was overtaken by fear and submitted to him. Thereupon Kaundinya married the queen Lieu-ye and ruled over the kingdom. Lieu-ye is likely Soma who is mentioned in other inscriptions.

> “It was there (Bhavapura) that Kaundinya the foremost among Brahmanas, planted the spear which he had obtained from Drona’s son Ashvattama the best of Brahmanas. There was a daughter of the king of serpents called Soma. She was taken as a wife by the excellent Brahmana Kaundinya for the sake of accomplishing certain work.
  King Bhavavarman who, being born in this pure unbroken line of kings descended from Kaundinya is even today the pride of his subjects by his un blamable conduct.”

### ज्ञानसम्बन्धः
This crowning glory of कौण्डिन्यगोत्र of the वसिष्ठाः quelled the बौद्ध & जैन hostilities against वैदिकधर्म & शैवमत with his nectarine tamizh poetry. How fitting that he who rejuvenated dharma should take descent from the ऋषि who gave the मृत्युञ्जय मन्त्र?!

### मणवाळमामुनिः
luminary of तॆङ्कलैसम्प्रदाय wrote many works in tamizh/मणिप्रवाळ. So beautiful was his erudition that रङ्गनाथस्वामि (viṣṇu) invited him to give discourses at the temple on the sacred तिरुवाय्मॊऴि & at it's end, accepted him as his own आचार्य.
