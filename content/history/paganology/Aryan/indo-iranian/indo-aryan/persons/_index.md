In this section, we list some great personalities we personally admire. Note: Hindu sounds are encoded in the latin alphabet using OPTITRANS.

## Definition and critique:  

Every person has some noble and some ignoble qualities. What makes a hero? A hero is a person, who may be flawed, but persistently develops and displays (personally and socially) noble traits, and does great deeds.

Heroes do not function in a vaccum: rather, they are able achieve their deeds building upon the deeds of others, and only due to cooperation and help from others. Of course, one should remember that the traits themselves should be the focus of admiration, and one should not descend to chauvinism which tries to deny unpleasent truths about these people.

## Some reasons:  

Why heroes? Stories of heros are often riveting; remembering their stories is an important part of cultivating a self which strives for these qualities when appropriate.

Why heroes from bhArata? We are emotionally (and biologically) attached to this 5000+ year old culture and people; so the inspiration we can draw from them is much stronger.  

Why make a list? Maybe this interests others. Helps organize one's thoughts on the matter, frees up my overly engrossed mind to pursue other interests.
