### AchArya Pandurang Vaman Kane
chitpAvana, author of the stunning, expansive "History of the dharmashAstras", whose [autobiography](http://dadegaonkar.blogspot.com/2007/09/p-v-kane-notes-for-biography.html) is in its epilogue.
  - On his motivation via his son at [prexA](https://www.prekshaa.in/reminiscences-pandurang-vaman-kane-part3): "It turns out that long before commencing the writing of the volumes, PVK had a keen interest in all subjects related to Indian culture. He also had a deep understanding of the dharma-shastras and matters related to Indian heritage. He was a master of the Sanskrit language and of his own interest, he had read the Vedas, Upaniṣads, the Epics, the Purāṇas, and other traditional works. But time and again, when PVK would come across the writing of some Western scholar or soi-disant Indologist on the subject of the dharma-śāstra that showed Indian culture in bad light, and his blood would boil. His anger would know no bounds when he came across writers who passed loose comments on the dharma-śāstras or concluded that the Indian mind was uncivilized and nascent. At the dining table, he would express his anguish, “What does this fellow know about India and its heritage to comment this way? Where on earth does he find all these things in our dharma-śāstras? What were people in Europe and the Americas doing when we already had a flourishing civilization in India?” Such constant episodes convinced him that he had to write something to shut the mouths of Western scholars who spewed absolute drivel about our ancient works. He made up his mind. “It is my duty to write this. I shall write about the dharma-śāstra in greater detail so that it will put all confusion to rest.” Doubtless he ended up becoming successful. A needle prick in the beginning sufficed to put the great mind on track to undertake the herculean task of compiling all the dharma-śāstras and its commentaries right from Parāśara, Manu, and Yājñavalkya all the way until the day on which he wrote the specific chapter. This included the judgments passed by Indian courts and the Privy Council."

### Pandit Narendra Dev Shastri
a Sanskrit scholar originally from Lahore, student of raghu-vIra, aided the thought-consolidation balinese hinduism.
    - "come to Bali by chance and that, to his surprise, he had discovered that the Balinese were Hindus like himself, even though they had for-gotten most of what Hinduism was about, a result of being kept in ignorance of religious matters by their priests. Thus he decided to bring the Balinese back in to the fold of Hinduism, for fear that if they persisted along their natural inclination,which is animism, they would become an easy prey to proselytizing, not so much by Muslims but by Christians—and worse, communists’."

### malhotra-rAjIva of Princeton New Jersey
who vigorously produced and funded books and a "svadeshi indology" movement to expose the influential and insidious mechanism of mlecCha indologist scholars, church organizations and leftist press. This despite some personal flaws - misplaced arrogance, alienating allies. Some would say: "ya ya he's not as revolutionary as he claims - many have critiqued mlecCha indology". But fact is that the malla's efforts are the most vigorous - even at the socio-political level beyond the academe.
