title = "malharrAv hoLkar"

+++
Fine and loyal general, whose initial impetuosity was tamed by bAji-rAv. He served under several successive peshvas - right up to mAdhavrAv - and was the major arm of the marATha-s in north India.

An encounter with mAdhavrAv:

> Just as he prepared to charge, Malharrao Holkar came up fleeing from the battle. He tried to dissuade Madhavrao and urged him to seek in Poona safety and a throne. The young prince turned on him on like a wounded tiger. "Then it is true" he said, "that you left Sadashivrao to die at Panipat?" Malharrao, stung to the quick, could but join his prince, and as the Mogol army advanced in the disorder of success, Madhavrao's cavalry burst on them stabbing, sabring, trampling down all resistance. Few troops then in India could have stood that furious onset and the Mogol army, that but a moment before had had victory in their grasp, were hurled headlong into the Godavari. Twenty-one guns and 15 elephants were captured on the field of battle, and Naldurg fort and territory yielding 82 lakhs of rupees were paid by the Nizam as the price of peace. - Tale of the Tulsi Plant and Other Studies By C.A. Kincaid
