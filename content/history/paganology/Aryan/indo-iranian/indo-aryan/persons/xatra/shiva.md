shiva/ [shivAji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivaji) kShatrapati (6 April 1627 or **19 Feb. 1630** – 3 April 1680)

## Impact
- यथान्यैरुक्तम् -
    - नैकदुर्गविजेतारं धर्मकण्टकनाशनम्। शिवराजं वन्देऽहं खानोदरविदारकम्॥
    - प्रातिपश्चन्द्रलेखैव वर्धिष्णुर् विश्ववन्दिता। शाहसूनोश् शिवस्यैषा मुद्रा भद्राय राजते॥
    - कासिहू ते कला जाती मथुरा मसीद होती सिवाजी न होतो तौ सुनति होत सबकी \- [भूषणः](http://bharatendu.com/2009/10/30/bhushana-sivaji-na-hoto-tau-sunnati-hota-sabaki/)।

## Brilliant concept
- under divine guidance, conceptualized and realized hindu svarAjya (evident even at a young age - see letter written to Dadaji Naras Prabhu at age 15 or 18 [SG-academia](https://www.academia.edu/22259519/Transitions_and_Translations_Regional_Power_and_Vernacular_Identity_in_the_Dakhan_1500_1800_SUMIT_GUHA)), 
- sought to rid hindusthAna of the mohammedan menace (letter to Jayasimha [archive](https://archive.org/stream/DeliverranceOrTheEscapeOfShivajiTheGreatFromAgra#page/n289/mode/2up), [P1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B10P1KzCIAAKDkZ.jpg:large) points 51 to 70, 
  - In south: "using the Qutbshah’s resources shivAjI conquered the fort of Gingee and extended his domain into the south ending the careers of several Jihadis and putting a check on the mlechCha-s who were surrounding the coast. As the drAviDa historian of the kOvaLan clan, nArAyaNan kOn put it he restored the rule of law in those regions."
- had measured regard for brAhmaNa-s taken to other dharma-s ([IMG](https://imgur.com/wSWxvEV)), who convened the [aShTha-pradhAnas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashta_Pradhan), 
- brought out the best in people ([S1](http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/history/forgotten-heroes-fought-alongside-shivaji/#)),
- who resanskritified marAThi (Surendranath Sen [snip](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3GT75dCIAAzcf0.png:large), rAjavyavahArakosha [ref](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/536370856206020609)). 

## Brilliant execution
- brilliant strategist \[[E1](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1z-DAFIIAA_lU0.jpg:large)\], 
- considered temporarily joining Awrangzeb \[[CG17](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/834464411398004736)\] to smash Adil shAh and Qutb shAh - but retained dignity and escaped when it did not go well.  
    - Inspired many, returned netAji pAlkar (who later redeserted) to the hindu fold after prAyashcitta\[[TW](https://twitter.com/ColonelGerard/status/876548420269334528)\]. 

## Stopping conversions
- "factory records say he beheaded 4 jesuit padres on their refusing to become H after having instigated Portuguese governor to persecute H".
- Factory records from 26th November, 1675 mention that he quarelled with Portunguese who converted orphans of his caste. [DY](https://dharmayuddha.wordpress.com/2010/11/13/some-contemporary-english-factory-letters-about-shivaji/)

## Flaws
- No "total war" : "We know he ordered his soldiers to respect the Koran, mosques, and sent back a mullah’s daughter that fell into his hands while the followers of Muhammad freely indulged in massacres of Hindu civilians and capture of Hindu women." 
- Though occasionally, he did destroy rAxasAlaya-s (French letter 1677 [TW](https://twitter.com/Kal_Chiron/status/861611487713837056)) and restored temples.


## Family
son of jIjA-bAyi and shAhAji, feudal servant of bijApura sultAn yet a supporter of shrIranga 3 the vijayanagara emperor \[[MT6](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/07/06/some-notes-on-shahji-and-sambhaji-the-brother-of-shivaji-iii/)\], brother of sAmbhA killed for lack of reinforcement from afzal khan in service of the sultAn, half brother of ekoji (a good ruler whose adhArmika betrayal was stemmed by shivAji by timely action).
