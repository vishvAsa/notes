wife of rAjArAm, daugher of hambIr-rAv, who kept up the fight against the mughal-s.
    - She was later sidelined by a newly released shAhu and bAlAjI vishvanAtha. She propped up an impostor ( Rajaram II) and attempted various vain strategems - only to be foiled by bAlAjI. "On 14 September 1752, the two took oaths at Khandoba temple in Jejuri, promising mutual peace. At this oath ceremony, Tarabai also swore that Rajaram II was not her grandson, but an impostor from the Gondhali caste.\[6\] Nevertheless, Peshwa retained Rajaram II as the titular Chhhatrapati and a powerless figurehead."
