## Traditional view
- Various iShTa-s and pUrti-s were said to earn merit, even as part of daily rituals like vaishvadeva
    - These include supporting scholars, providing food to various people (even to chaNDAla-s in the daily vaishvadeva) \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/09/24/on-some-danas-and-utsargas-of-the-mediaeval-hindus/)\]

## Current situation

  - "India has climbed 24 places (from 93) in its overall ranking of 69 out of the 135 countries that participated in the World Giving Index 2014 survey."
  - "India, which was once noted for engaging in acts of non-institutional charity (especially at religious places or events) has increasingly begun to donate to NGOs. Despite having smaller adult populations than China, both India and the United States have more individuals donating money to charity. A total of 24.9 crore Indians donated to NGOs, followed by the US at 17.5 crore people and China at 14.8 crore."
  - "Nearly 18.65 crore people in India support non-profit organizations (popularly known as non-government organizations or NGOs) by volunteering their time and effort. In stark contrast, China, with only 6.8 crore volunteers, was fourth on this list. "

## British destruction of native charity

"Once the state came into the picture, the commissioners wanted the individuals with their spontaneous charitable impulses to simply get out of the way. And even their contributions to the relief effort of the state were unwelcome." In their report of July 7, 1880, the famine commissioners observe:

> Native society in India is justly famous for its charity. It is owing to the profound sense which is felt by all classes of the religious duty of succouring, according to their means, the indigent and helpless who have claims on them as members of the family, the caste, or the town or village, that in ordinary times no State measures of relief are needed. Native charity, however, does not work according to the English pattern. It does not tend to organization or co-operation among those who bestow it; it consists too much in giving a small dole to numerous applicants rather than in providing completely for the wants of a few applicants. Such charity is to be encouraged at the beginning of distress;.. .but when famine has once set in with severity it may become a serious evil unless it can be brought under some systematic control. .. .When once Government has taken the matter thoroughly in hand and provided relief in one shape or another for all who need it, and a proper inclosed place of residence for all casuals and beggars, street-begging and public distribution of alms to unknown applicants should be discouraged, and if possible entirely stopped.”

> The imperative of providing a wage that does not exceed the requirements of bare survival is mentioned and discussed again and again in the report.
