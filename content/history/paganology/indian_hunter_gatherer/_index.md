## Initial hominid settlement
- Narmada cranial fragment is believed to be H.heidelbergensis from around 250,000-300,000 years BP. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
- Exact date of modern human entry as well as the effect of the giant Toba volcano explosion on Indian hominid population is unclear. [{MT}](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/12/giant-volcanos-and-humans/)
  - "Likewise, previous archaeological studies have recovered actual human fossils from only around 31,000 years (the Shri Lankan caves), though there are poorly studied assemblages of earlier stone tools from main land India."

## Early Hunter Gatherer settlement
- There were early hunter gatherer (=IHG) groups - currently reflected in isolated Indian tribes. Those close to the un-admixed old Indian H-G Are the south Indian tribes from the Tamil country like the Irula, Malayan, Kadar, Pulliyar and Paniya. They are the deeply divergent mainland sister group of the Onge/Jarawa of the Andamans. A represent a remnant population of early out of Africa immigrants who first reached India. There they might have mixed with one or more preexisting archaic Homo (one might have been the Denisovans) but the details of that are limited. These old Indian HG tribes share a deep ancestry with the Onge, Papuans, Naasioi and Australians. 
- IVC (see below) + IHG gave rise to pre-Aryan Indians (confusingly called ancestral south Indians  / ASI by Reich etal).
