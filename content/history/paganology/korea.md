- Late Joseon (1890s) - Protestantism sunk deep roots in Korea in the 1890s, establishing a network of schools and hospitals. The missionaries led campaigns for the burning of idols, ancestral tablets, shamans' tools and clothes, and shrines. The police began to arrest shamans, destroy shrines and burn ritual tools.
- The Yangban and later elite grew to disdain mudang. Partly hence, sporadic harassment of shamans continued under Japanese rule.
- Later, harassment continued vigorously as part of Park Chung-hee's Saemaul Undong. ([SP_TW_18](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/954667990456287234)) Rituals were attacked with economic justification.
