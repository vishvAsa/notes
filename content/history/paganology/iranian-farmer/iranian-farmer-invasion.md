## Iranian farmers
"The Iranian farmers are a population emerging from the vicinity of the Zagros mountains and are related to the Caucasian hunter-gather shown as CHG in the Arya-iranian-farmers-asi-service-castes-pca figure. "

## Rise of Harappa
Indus Valley civilization (IVC) area were settled by a people heavy in Iranian Farmer input (over a prior IHG substrate). 

- The shudra-s, early enemy of the Arya-s, may have been part of these people. \[[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/990301565436284935)\]
- A prominent theory is that these people were referred to by neighboring civilizations as Meluḫḫa or Melukhkha (later giving rise to sanskrit mlecCha) \[[W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meluhha)\].

## Rise of service jAti-s
- As you can see in the Arya-iranian-farmers-asi-service-castes-pca figure many of the middle and service castes are positions on this cline of Indian HG-IRF admixture and have a genetic heritage predominantly of this type. The supports the idea that the diversified service jAti-s typical of India developed in the Harappan system and continued relatively intact after the subsequent Aryan conquest of the land.
- South Indian jAti distinctness predates Aryan arrival \[[NG](http://press.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/28/southern-india-caste-system-indo-europeans-genographic/#.UlnHJmsTfFw.twitter)12, [PLOS](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050269)\].

## Language and script
The language and script of these people remains a mystery.

### Features
- "karpAsa was indeed the Harappan word for cotton&shamali wood was also from that language. Also kInAsha: farmer, kulAla: potter, kaivarta: fisherman etc." \[[MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/990301565436284935)\]
- "we can reconstruct several other words and say it was probably ergativizing like modern Hindi/Marathi".

### Theories
- Elamite of neighboring SW Iran is a strong candidate for a relative.
- Others point to Dravidian and a proto Elamo Dravidian model (which is rather untenable - George Starostin [here](http://starling.rinet.ru/Texts/elam.pdf)).
- The Burushaski isolate is another candidate.

### Problems with draviDian theory
One strong argument in that direction has been Brahui a Dravidian language in lands with high Iranian farmer contribution. However, we argue that Dr was not the Harappan language because:
- 1) There is a common substratum including for agricultural terms and plants that is shared by both Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages. This implies there was once a third language in the picture and unique to the subcontinent.
- 2) We don't find Dr as the earliest distinctly Indian substrate in IA but Dr loans appear later. The earliest available Dr text show evidence in contrast for a long contact with IA and IA literary and cultural conventions.
- 3) If we look at the [recently constructed tree](../images/dravidian-language-tree.png) for Dr based on linguistic data Brahui is lodged quite deep in the tree with no indication of a root-ward position that would be expected if it were the relict of a Harappan Dr presence in the NW.
- 4) Now with genetic data we can constraint ages. The clearly defined language families like IE, DR, AA are unlikely to be much older than 6000 YBP. That offers a kind of bound that suggests that Pr-DR was not very old -- at best around Mature Harappan suggesting that it might not have had deep history which also inconsistent with the loans from another language.

### 
Hence, together we surmise that the Iranian farmers brought a now lost language that was the primary Harappan.
