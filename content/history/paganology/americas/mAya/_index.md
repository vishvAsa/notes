## Revolts
### Caste war
The Caste War of Yucatán (1847–1901) began with the revolt of culturally Native Maya people of the Yucatán Peninsula against the culturally European (and in the elite, racially Caucasian) Latino population, called Yucatecos. The latter had long held political and economic control of the region. A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the northwest of the Yucatán and the independent Maya in the southeast.

### Chiapas rebellion
The Mayan Zapatista Army (EZLN) on January 1, 1994, the day when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect, issued its First Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle and its Revolutionary Laws.
