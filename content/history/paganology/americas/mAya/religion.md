## Traditionalist Catholicism
### Status under Christianity
“Traditionalist Catholicism” refers to a broad set of religious beliefs, traditions, and practices that generally align with Roman Catholicism, but intermingle Indigenous polytheism and practices to form a local syncretic faith.

Traditionalists are part of a loosely organized North American denominational movement often called Old Catholicism. This movement adopts and affirms Roman Catholic traditions and theology while asserting independence from Rome. While they are often conservative, Old Catholic denominations can differ widely among themselves and with Rome on issues such as the ordination of women, divorce, and homosexuality.

### Polytheist practices
To the far north of Chiapas near the US border, for example, the Traditionalist Mexican-American Catholic Church breaks away from Roman Catholicism over its veneration of Santa Muerte.

> “Behind the collection of saints and virgins in the San Juan Bautista church are Ah Puch, Chaac, Ixchel, Kukulkán, and the whole pantheon of ancient Mayan gods,” adds Ramos. “They have adapted to their new names and now celebrate new festivities, but their true essences remain.”
