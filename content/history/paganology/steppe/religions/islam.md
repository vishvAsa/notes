- (via MT:) Al BalAdhurI describing the desecration of Iranian temples in Samarkand by the monstrous Qutaybah bin Muslim: "They destroyed the temple of the idols and the fire temples. The idols were thrown out, plundered of their ornaments, and burned, although the Parsis used to say that among them was one idol with which whoever trifled would perish. But when Qutaybah set fire to it with his own hand, many of them accepted Islam."
