## Why examine history?

- Intellectual discourse and debates within any society play a major role in determining its future course. Oftentimes, such debates draw support from various narratives/ stories about history (internal or foreign)
    - Often these narratives have an excessively narrow focus, and contain factual errors, leading to spurious claims about various courses of action and ways of life. Such claims need to be countered - only a thorn can remove a thorn.
- It is useful as individuals to observe the good and bad qualities of various heroes.

## Why not to examine history?

- History is not central to benefiting from the hindu worldview (../compared to the abrahamisms). Understanding living traditions and texts considered holy is far more important as a way of benefiting from the lessons learned by passed sages (see also Rituals: [Knowledge transmission](../self-cultivation/rituals/)).
- This is illustrated by a stark contrast between the worldview of a paNDita and the (dominant) worldview among indologists \[[AA](https://archive.org/stream/paNDit-papers/ScholasticismPanditTraditionalScholarshipInIndiaFestschriftOrCommeomorationParameswaraAithalAxelMichaelsarticles#page/n51/mode/2up)\]. Particularly, divergences in the commitment to:
    - memorization of the core of the shAstra,
    - the devaluation of historicity ( which seems to anticipate what I've heard about "histori-centrism" popularized by rAjIv malhotra ),
    - the following of some severe codes of conduct. It also explores the differences in society that support these/ result from such divergent types of scholarship.

## How to examine history?

### Pursuit of truth.  

In order to avoid these suprious claims which adversely affect our future, it is important to seek historical truth - pleasant or otherwise.

 असतो मा सद्गमय, तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय, मृत्योर्मा अमृतं गमय। ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः॥

### Acknowledge bias.

One **should admit** that the study of history involves explaining relatively sparse data with convincing patterns. Here bias comes to play.

- Common narratives include:
    - The subaltern/ Marxist narrative places a huge focus on class warfare, on the oppression of many by the elite few. One claim is that the dharma is inherently incapable of benefiting the many.
    - The Fabian narrative places a big focus on the 'civilizing'/ 'modernizing' effect of colonial rule in India. A common claim is that, were it not for the British, the Indians would be a primitive, superstitious people, lacking in social and economic development. Another common claim is that India would be politically divided into principalities which could not withstand external threats, and that the dhArmika civilization, which was falling into decay during Muslim rule, was rescued by the British.
        - The dharma-centric narrative emphasizes the intellectual and cultural efflorcence of the dhArmika civilization, the devastating effects of Islamic and European conquest, and is hopeful about the dharma's ability to adapt to the modern world and bring prosperity to many.
        - Eg. Ram Swarup. Sitaram Goel. KS Lal. Koenraad Elst
        - As Koenraad says: "I applaud the insight that we should write history, rather than piecemeal refutations of the false history put out by the secularists." \[[FB](https://www.facebook.com/vikramvgarg/posts/10104784482166260?comment_id=10104785819960310&notif_t=like)\]
- Of these, I am most sympathetic to the last, but I try my best to not foresake the truth. I am under the impression that the Marxist narrative is the worst offender in terms of compromizing and twisting facts to suit their political agenda.

### Identify patterns

- Patterns in history of cultures can be viewed in terms of interacting memes, temes and genes.
- Though it was vertical for the most part, just as in the case of genes, there is lateral transfer of temes and memes accross cultures.
    - "One could cite the examples of Hindu memes in the Nipponic civilization or the Iranic memes in the Mongol tradition. Likewise, it was the lateral transfer of Hellenistic memes that caused the scientific developments attributed to the realm of the early marūnmatta-s and later what the mlecchas term the Renaissance." - MT  
- Example: Schism of liberals ([KV15](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/a-hindu-perspective-on-zoroastrians-schism-of-the-liberals-and-its-dangers/)).  
        
#### Bio structures
- Biological notions of homology, analogy, phase of development in lifecycle to group similar historical phenomena together can be used. Spengler and MT ([MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/sulapuru%E1%B9%A3a-catvarakam-3-a-method-for-the-analysis-of-history/)).
- Similar morphological structures arising at some point in the lifecycle due to shared ancestry: "Now when you look at the zygote of a man and one of a crocodile the homologies will not be apparent at that point. But as the embryos develop you will see that both develop equivalent sets of tissues, organs and systems which you are now able to see as being homologs of each other. .. Thus, Spengler’s idea implies that the civilizations in their embryonic state have homologous programs that execute themselves as the civilization develops."
- Phases in lifecycle: Similar transitions from one morphological expression to another predictably occurs in a wide variety of species and civilizations. But, the clock can be reset (at a cost), since these phases can be cyclic.
- Examples
    - "For instance I would consider expressions such as Roman law and Mānava dharma homologous in this vein. Likewise, the development of Neo-Platonism and classical post-vaidika vedānta can be seen as homologies expressing in the Hellenes and the Hindu world." - MT
    - "There civilizations are arrayed as though playing out a developmental plan, as you mentioned, with a ”homology” in their cognate growth stages which are labeled from spring to winter. That civilizations have a such phases is not in doubt – in the case our own civilization we undoubtedly see a certain refreshing vigor at the dawn of our civilization in the śruti-s of the Ṛk and the early Atharvāñgirasa. We see a certain genius in our early medical tradition from the latter texts and Caraka, in the mathematics of the Śulba, and in the sūtra-s of the sages Kaṇāda and Akṣapāda. Over time we even see a certain maturity: in the religion of the Tantra-s, the medicine of Vāgbhaṭa, and the genius of king Bhoja and Bhāskara. Then we see an autumn where the soma-drinking Nīlakaṇṭha and Loliṃbarāja standout like the bright colors of the deciduous leaves and an Appayya like a sprinkling of snow shining on the footpath on an autumn evening. We are indeed in that winter where we shudder in the confines our heated homes with a blizzard blowing all around us."
    - Cyclic resets: "after the Ragnarok, Modi and Magni would return with Vidarr and in our thought there is still a new cycle that will come, for which the seeds must exist in this one. ... there is the teaching regarding the great axe-wielding Rāma’s battle with the Vītahavya-s, Tuṇḍikera-s, and Tālajaṅgha-s

#### Temes, their survival and fitness value.
- Survivability
    - "Then we may also ask why technological innovations of high standing to do not persist in civilizations – Why did the surgical instruments of Divodāsa vanish; why was the Antikythera mechanism forgotten; why did Mayan way of building concrete roads cease to exist? It does seem to suggest that technologies emerge at a certain points in the evolution of independent cultures and may vanish unless a certain process of lateral transfer disperses them more widely between cultures, even as the lateral transfer of memes. The inventor of a technology may not be the one who actually benefits from it – hence, a teme might perish due to the indifferent or negative fitness advantage it confers on the host, unless it has other means to laterally spread itself." ([MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/sulapuru%E1%B9%A3a-catvarakam-3-a-method-for-the-analysis-of-history/))
- Fitness value to the host:
    - Lateral transfer to competitors: "Rather than the inventor, someone else who has merely acquired a teme by lateral transfer might make most use of it. ... Likewise, many technologies were invented by mlecchas but it was not they who made most use of it; rather it was the pītavarṇa-śvapaca-s and bindudhvaja-s who did so. Hence, the śūlapuruṣa prophetically feared that technologies invented by gaurāṅga-s might help anyavarṇa-s against them – the fight of this type launched by the bindudhvaja-s on the gaurāṅga-s is well-known to the discerning." ([MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/sulapuru%E1%B9%A3a-catvarakam-3-a-method-for-the-analysis-of-history/))
    - Causing senescence:
        - "Finally, like successful memes which might be maladaptive to the host, the spread of certain temes might also be maladaptive to the host and drive cultural senescence. Following the śūlapuruṣa we may say money itself might fall in this category: I don’t know whether it is all meme or teme or mixture of both, but as it becomes the central focus of the culture it exposes the said culture to a certain vulnerability which allows senescence to set in." ([MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/sulapuru%E1%B9%A3a-catvarakam-3-a-method-for-the-analysis-of-history/))
    

### Drawing lessons

- Hindu approaches in the itihAsa-s, purANa-s and kAvya-s was to digest the most important lessons in a form that is pleasing (eg. context of a drama or story), abstracted away (with supernatural elements, fictional characters) and dramatized (to enhance contrast between positive and negative decisions.)  
- Periodic reminders are useful: [This day in hindu history](event_record/).
