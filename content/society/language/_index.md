## Human vs programming languages
Natural language processing considers how human language can be generated or understood by a computer.

Design of language which can be translated to instructions understood by a compiler is considered elsewhere.

## Descriptive vs prescriptive
Descriptive linguistics studies the language as it is actually used by a certain group of people. Prescriptive linguistics considers the language as it 'ought' to be used.

## Themes
Computational linguistics tries to understand human language generation and comprehension using computer models.

### Example applications/ problems
Authorship attribution.

Interaction with humans: Eg: IBM built 'Watson', a program which participates in the propular TV trivia show jeopardy, where it responds to phrases with questions to which they are an answer.

Human language acquisition.

### Ambiguity: main challenge
Comprehension and generation of text is just translation between natural language and the language of logic. The ambiguity in natural language is the main problem in this process.
