## Joiners
- Cabinet hinges
  - INR 35 per peice.
  - can open without needing clearance to the side. 
- L clamp
  - 2 inch - Rs 2 per piece on IndiaMart; retails 10 / piece 

## Screws
- Avoid minus / flathead screws - prone to slippage during operation. Star (Phillips) scews better, hex-star and square hole screws even better.
- Woodworking screws have a tapered head - so head does not stick out.
