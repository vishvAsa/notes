Academic hiring follows a different pattern.

## Selectivity

Hiring people is generally easier than getting rid of them. So, when possible, businesses create interview processes which have low ’false positive’ rates - even at the cost of high ’false negative’ rates.

## Process

Often, specialized recruiters are used to make initial contacts with people - in order to get an idea of where how the candidate may fit the company’s needs. That person then may pitch the candidate to potential hirers.

### Screening rounds

There is often a written/ programming/ modeling test or a technical phone screen, and successful candidates are then invited for an in-person interviews (travel expenses usually being paid by the hirer).

### Technical interviews

In each of these stages, multiple persons (including potential hiring managers and peers) are used to reduce margin of error. In interviews, potential employers probe the candidate’s knowledge, skills and personality. Ideally, interviewers should allow the candidate some time to think, try to minimize pressure - especially if ’working under pressure’ is not a job requirement.

### Big-boss interview

The final interview is usually with the highest-level boss, where a simple technical question may be asked. The reason for this final interview is unclear - except perhaps the company wanting to rely on the ’feeling’ of a senior person.

Research seems to show that in such qualitative interviews’ outcomes are decided in the first few moments of the interview!

## Candidate’s strategy

The candidate’s strategy is to present his skills, knowledge and professional attitude to the interviewers; and to gather information/ impressions to judge whether the organization - especially the team he will be working with - will match his expectations.

### Attitude

The professional attitude to be presented includes calmness, the ability to collect and compose oneself and one’s proposals. A social aspect is being friendly, with pleasant body language described elsewhere.

### Answers and limits

When his knowledge and skills are being probed in live-communication, the candidate should answer to the best of his ability - taking time to think if necessary. He may not be able to answer all questions - especially if he is seeking work which is at the edge of his abilities.

### Judging potential employers

This is done both by reading online reviews (Eg: glassdoor.com ), by asking questions to potential peers/ managers, and by observing their interactions with you and each other.

### Salary negotiation

Know how much you can get both for the job in a particular area in general and from the company in particular, by visiting online surveys (eg: glassdoor.com ). Use this to answer questions about the ’expected salary’.
