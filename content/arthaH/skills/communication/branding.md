## Aim: honest appraisal

Don’t worry about impressing people too much. Just be honest, don’t feel
that you have to project a false image of yourself, while simultaneously
avoiding erroneous perception of you by others.

Sincerity and self confidence involved in doing so are valued.

## Informing others of your worth

Discreetly sell your work and worth - It is insane to expect others to
do it entirely for you. "If I tell you I’m good, you would probably
think I’m boasting. If I tell you I’m no good, you know I’m lying." -
Bruce Lee

## Branding
Aim to truthfully project both competence and warmth.

Gravity and immersion/ mastery over an art are appreciated deeply -
display this. Even though he was not especially kind or considerate,
Ramanujan was very likable. He wore his heart on his sleeve. He was
humble in attitude. His sincerity resulted in the magnetic personality
of a secular sanyasi.

### svarUpa-saMskAraH

Often questions are raised about various aspects of the brAhmaNa
saMpradAya - especially shrIcharaNaM, yajJNOpavItaM and shikhA. It is
good to have well-prepared responses.

’These are the customs of my people. They are a very important part of
my cultural identity, so I value them very much. They are a critical
piece of who I am. If I were to cut any of them out, it would be akin to
loosing a piece of my soul.’
