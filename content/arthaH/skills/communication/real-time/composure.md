Prepare content in advance if necessary.

## Importance

This is especially important while meeting strangers.

Most people do not want to be burdened by an unsettled, harried
individual - they are wary of getting tangled in unsavoury business.

## General technique

Concentrate on the high order bits: the important matter. Solemnly
recognize that exchange of information/ expectations is the most
important point of the meeting and determinedly focus the intellect on
it.

## Suppressing inopportune reactions

It may sometimes be inopportune to feel or display laughter or anger or
nervousness.

Use breath control. (PraaNaayaama)
