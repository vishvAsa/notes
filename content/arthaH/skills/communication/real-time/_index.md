## Dress strategy

Dressing in clothing in light/bright colors will make you stand out more
in a crowd and look more approachable.

Wear something comfortable, but which will project the impression of one
serious in his work.

## Timing

When you are overtly trying to sell something, for example your
qualifications, do it only when you are adequately prepared, otherwise,
you may create an unfavorable impression leading to the failure of the
mission.

Do not interrupt a person who is known to dislike interruptions.
