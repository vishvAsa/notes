title: Communication

## Nature and purpose

Fundamentally, all communication is about making another person
understand something which you have to say, which could be a request/
demand, an explanation etc.. .

So, in designing the delivery mechanism, one should not only consider
the message to be delivered, but also the other personâ€™s ability to
receive that message.

Even by silently observing or by being absent, you are participating.

## Establishing good memories in others

People choose between memories of experiences, rather than experiences
themselves. So, the ending is extremely important in any interaction.
Giving gifts at the end of formal occasions is a good idea.
