Recent studies indicate that high intake of antioxidant vitamins
(vitamins C, E and beta-carotene) does not appear to provide significant
protection against Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It is Phytochemicals in fruits
or vegetables that provide the real benefit. The skins of fruits and
vegetables are particularly rich in these phytochemicals. Recent studies
have shown that polyphenols (like resveratrol in wine) extend maximum
lifespan by 59 percent and delay age-dependent decay of cognitive
performance in animal models.
