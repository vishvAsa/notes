Fiber can be soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fibers aid bowel movement.

Soluble fiber helps reduce cholesterol, reduces sugar response after
eating, normalizes blood lipid levels. Soluble fiber is not broken down
until it reaches the large intestine where digestion causes gas
(flatulence). In excessive amounts, soluble fiber causes high
flatulance, cramps.

Fibers in legumes, such as peanuts, beans is mostly soluble fibers.

Tree Nuts have insoluble fibers.
