## Criteria
- Filtered water storage
  - capacity
  - Material
- Certifications
  -  ISI, WQA or NSF
- Quality of service and maintenance

### Water quality
- Hardness
- salinity
- TDS (Total dissolved solids).
  -  TDS principally includes calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates, and small amounts of organic matter
  - Higher in borewell water
  - TDS levels greater than 1000 mg/litre make drinking-water increasingly unpalatable and unhealthy.

## Chemical filtration
### Carbon filter
- When used as a pre-filter - removes chemical contamination - chlorine, chloramide, fluoride etc.. Hence AKA chemiblock.
- When used as a post-filter, it removes bad odor and improves taste.  
- Carbon cartridge needs to be flushed before installation - else it may send black water downstream and damage RO filter. +++(ALERT!)+++
- Contains activated carbon, which has high surface area -  so high abrsorptive power.

## Quality
- Check how much it is filled by shaking it or breaking open. Half filled filters specially useless if installed horizontally. Slight noise is ok.
- Natural coal contains high sulphur - so not suitable. Coconut shell made ones are better - 10 times better than natural coal.
- Quality of coal is measured with IV (iodine value). 1100 to 1200 good.
- Good filter should get chalked.

## Simple membrane filtration
- Simple Gravity filters. Good for removing mud etc..

### .1 micron
- Aka Microfiltration
- Ceramic filters (Used in old water filter candles) - 0.2 microns pores
- Sediment cartridges come in .1 microns (Filterkart) as of 2020. Sediment cartridge gets chalked over time with sand, silt, rust etc. (if good quality). [Filterkart vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxYqCq7vAFE). 
- very high effectiveness in removing protozoa (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia); moderate effectiveness in removing bacteria (for example, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli); not effective in removing viruses (for example, Enteric, Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Rotavirus); removes microplastics, not effective in removing chemicals.

### .01 micron
- Water is forced to flow through insides of small hollow fibers
- Membranes used are predominantly created from polymer thin films.
- Aka UF (Ultrafiltration)
- Pore size
  - Removes bacteria, virus etc..
  - .01 micron pores -[Filterkart vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBANA4N1wLs)
- very high effectiveness in removing protozoa (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia), bacteria (for example, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli); moderate effectiveness in removing viruses (for example, Enteric, Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Rotavirus); low effectiveness in removing chemicals.

### .001 micron Nanofiltration (NF)
- Good for low TDS
- Smaller (nanometer) pores than microfiltration and ultrafiltration; just larger than RO membranes.
- can "soften" water by retaining scale-forming, hydrated divalent ions (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+) while passing smaller hydrated monovalent ions.
- very high effectiveness in removing protozoa (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia), bacteria (for example, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli),  viruses (for example, Enteric, Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Rotavirus); moderate effectiveness in removing chemicals.

## RO (Reverse Osmosis)
- filters 98% heavy dissolved solids: metals, particulates, minerals
- Recommended for TDS 200-2k.
- uses semi permeable membranes
- Wastes 2x or 3x water. Green RO water purifiers better.

### Effectiveness
- very high effectiveness in removing protozoa (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia), bacteria (for example, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli),  viruses (for example, Enteric, Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Rotavirus)
- remove common chemical contaminants (metal ions, aqueous salts), including sodium, chloride, copper, chromium, and lead; may reduce arsenic, fluoride, radium, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, nitrate, and phosphorous.

### Drawback
Removal of beneficial minerals like ca, mg and cobalt (part of vitamin b12).

### Membranes
- Longer membranes (more windings in filter cylinder) imply more filtration (provided the pump has the ability to push water through it).
- GPD = Gallons per day.
- Aquaguard Reviva 2016 used 75 GPD membrane.

### TDS regulator
- Regulates the water flowing through RO membrane.
- Vids - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0IKcpnndQ)
- Applied to waste water pipe in RO system. 

### Flow restrictor
- When flow restrictor is applied there is higher water pressure.

### Zero wastage RO
- Pump back rejected water to pipe.
- Have 2 tanks - one to collect rejected water.


## Distillation
- very high effectiveness in removing protozoa (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia), bacteria (for example, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli),  viruses (for example, Enteric, Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Rotavirus)
- remove common chemical contaminants (metal ions, aqueous salts), including sodium, chloride, copper, chromium, and lead; may reduce arsenic, fluoride, radium, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, nitrate, and phosphorous.

## Disinfection
- UV (Ultraviolet filtration)
- Distillation

## Generic Fittings
- john guest push fittings - a ring air-tight seals the connected pipe when the pipe is pushed all the way through. To release, one pushes this ring (by hand or screwdriver). 
- Weight sensor - breaks the circuit of filtration pump when the output tank is filled with water.

### Pump
- Good pumps come with heat sinks.
- Capacity is measured in Gallons Per day GPD.

## Filter replacement
- Aquadyne video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v9HApGAmY0).
- filterkart site in India - used once. Good quality filters, it seems.
- Good idea to change external sediment filter every 6 months or so.
- Service near sahakAranagara
  - Manju and chandan - INR 2800 in 2023 for replacing prefilter, sediment, carbon, RO filters, + flow restrictor. 3k when another pre-filter was serviced.
  - alt 2024 - INR 3500 for replacing pump, coil
