      <description>Water table  Ground water is simply the subsurface water that fully saturates pores or cracks in soils and rocks. This water is consumed by evaporation, plants and human pumping, and is recharged by precipitation. Below the ground, at a certain level is the &amp;ldquo;saturated zone&amp;rdquo;. This is generally close to the level of water in a nearby surface water body. Above it is the &amp;ldquo;unsaturated zone&amp;rdquo;. In this unsaturated zone, there usually is at least a little water, mostly in smaller openings of the soil and rock; the larger openings usually contain air instead of water.</description>
