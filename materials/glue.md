## Properties
- Bond/ peel strength

## Solvents
- White glue also contains water. Water acts as a solvent that keeps the glue liquid until you want it to stick. When you put glue on a piece of paper, the solvent — water — is exposed to air. The water eventually evaporates. As the water evaporates, the glue dries and hardens. All that's left are the sticky polymers that hold things together. This process is called mechanical adhesion.
- When white glue is inside a bottle, there's not enough air inside the bottle to cause the water to evaporate to make the glue sticky.

## Poly-vinyl-acetate
- The product will have better strength when % solids are higher.
- Details - see plastics page.

## cyanoacrylate
- Superglue
- These chemical bonds things together when it reacts with water vapor in the air. This process is called chemical adhesion.

## Other base compounds
- epoxy and polyurethane
