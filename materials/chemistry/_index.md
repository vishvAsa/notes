## Elements and the atomic theory
### Atomic theory of matter
All elements are combinations of around 130 elements in different proportions. Each element has a certain chemical property.

### Orbitals
s1, s2, p1, p2, p3, q, r. s is spherical, p is octal-shaped. Hybrid orbitals sp1 etc..

## Physical structure of matter
### Molecular structure
#### Notation
(Lewis) Letters represent various atoms; Dots represent valence electrons, possibly shared. .O:H.

Or, can use 1/2/3 dashes to represent single/ double/ triple bonds.

#### 3-D structures
Can use 'Newman projection' diagrams.

## Metrics
Concentration - (1% dilution =) 1 wt% would mean 10 mg in 1000mg solvent.

## Oxidation, reduction
Oxidation: Involves the loss of electrons by a reactant.  
Reduction: Involves the gain of electrons by a reactant.  
Both processes occur together in redox reactions.

## Dynamics of chemical reactions
### Low level view
Chemical reacion involves making and breaking of bonds; which requires atoms to collide. The former usually has to happen first: this requires an activation energy. This can be supplied with heat, light etc..

### Grosser view
Reactions can be endothermic or exothermic.

## Organic chemistry
Hydrocarbons. Aliphatic vs aromatic compounds. Aliphats can be alkanes, alkenes or alkynes. Functional groups in hydrocarbons: -NH2 or =O-OH.


### Proteins
#### structure
A chain of amino acids. Amino acids are 20. $H_3N-C_\ga(R)(CH_3)-COOH$. $COO-H_2N$ is the peptide bond: Just the right strength for biological activity: not too strong, not too weak.
