Artificial Fleece, aka polar fleece or microfleece, is a good insulator.
Usually made of PET of the polyester family. Suitable for outer and
middle layers. Can be made breathable: So suitable for physical exertion
involving perspiration.

## Advantages

It is light, soft, comfortable, hydrophobic (holding less than 1% of its
weight in water when fully soaked), highly breathable. Dries fast.

## Disadvantages

It tends to generate very high static electricity charges. This makes it
a magnet for pet hairs and other dust and fluff. Not windproof (although
some more expensive grades are denser and designed to be windproof. Can
be damaged by high-temperature washing and drying. But looses insulation
when wet. The down-side for polyester is odor retention, and lower
durability.
