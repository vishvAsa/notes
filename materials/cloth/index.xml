      <title>Breathability</title>

      <description>It is the weave of the fabric (the size and number of holes) that determines breathability or resistance to air movement. Any woven or knit fabric will breathe - even if the weave is made of rubber strands.
If the yarn on the outside of the garment is thinner than the yarn on the inside of the garment, capillary action will pull water to the outside. The increased surface area (not hollow fibre cores) of the thin yarn gives the water more space to spread out.</description>

      <description>Cotton absorbs water, and does not repel water. heavy.
Denim is cotton. Denim is a good wind breaker.
Material which is a suitable blend of cotton and polyester is desirable for use as an insulator.</description>

      <description>Light, but breaks down with use. Excellent warmth to weight ratio. the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet; so good in combination with waterproof material.</description>

      <guid>file:///storage/emulated/0/notesData/notes/materials/cloth/Polyester/</guid>
      <description>Artificial Fleece, aka polar fleece or microfleece, is a good insulator. Usually made of PET of the polyester family. Suitable for outer and middle layers. Can be made breathable: So suitable for physical exertion involving perspiration.
Advantages It is light, soft, comfortable, hydrophobic (holding less than 1% of its weight in water when fully soaked), highly breathable. Dries fast.
Disadvantages It tends to generate very high static electricity charges. This makes it a magnet for pet hairs and other dust and fluff.</description>

      <guid>file:///storage/emulated/0/notesData/notes/materials/cloth/Rain_proofing/</guid>
      <description>Rainclothes made out of tightly knit nylon are rain and wind proof, and are breathable.
Material which is water proof under 30000 mm of water is labelled water proof. Highly water proof material is also highly windproof.</description>
