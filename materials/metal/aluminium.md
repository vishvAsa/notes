### Leeching
- Even scraping an aluminium vessel with a steel spoon dislodges particles of the metal. It enters the food cooked in this vessel and then into the body through food. Daily approximately 5 milligrams of aluminium enters the body. 
- Acidic substances helps aluminium ions to dissolve in the food faster
