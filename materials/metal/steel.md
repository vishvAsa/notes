## Labor
- Labor (Arumukha) - 30 / sqft
- MS grill with materials and installation - ~ 450/sqft
- Highly finished door (hollow?) steel - Rs 700/sqft (IndiaMart) - Rs 14.7k.


## Mild steel (MS)
- Aka Carbon steel
- rusts when exposed to air and moisture. This iron oxide film is active and accelerates corrosion by forming more iron oxide.
- stiff and strong
- exhibit ferromagnetism (i.e. they are magnetic). This means they are extensively used in motors and electrical appliances.
- Welding: Welding carbon steels with a carbon content greater than 0.3 % requires that special precautions be taken. However, welding carbon steel presents far fewer problems than welding stainless steels.
- no more than 2 % carbon and no other appreciable alloying element.

### Cost
- Sold in "lengths" of 6m or 19.6ft
- Price fluctuates daily based on steel price.
- 72mm x 72mm (2.8" x 2.8") rectangular pipe - 5100 Rs per length
- 80mm x 40mm (3.14" x 1.5") rectangular pipe - 2000 Rs per length
- 50mm x 50 mm (~2" x 2") rectangular  pipe - 1700 Rs per length
- 25mm x 25mm (~1" x 1") rectangular  pipe - 669 Rs per length

## Stainless steel
- Corrodes and stains less, but not stain-proof.
- 12% + Chromium added for corrossion resistance.
- very expensive. Hence items are often made hollow.
- 202 grade
- 304 grade  
- 316 grade

## Cast Iron
- >2% carbon. Brittle.
- Most cast iron plumbing systems had at least one leak within 20 years of installation

## Galvanized Iron
- Galvanized steel has zinc layer on the surface level, which when there is scratch, it tends to corrode.
- GI pipes - zinc layer may leach lead.

### GI sheet cost 2021
- Market dominated by u3s in sahakAranagara bengaLUru.
- 1mm 8x4 - 6000 or 166 / sqft
- 2mm 8x4 - 9360

### Ribbed sheets
- Aka profile Sheets.
- Has ribs every few inches apart. Sheets are joined with screws in these raised parts - reduces water leakage. 
- Tata Durashine sheet (47mm?) thick
  - Layers - Color, Zn-Al, Core steel, Zn-Al, Color
  - Better standards - thickness, shaping to reduce leaks at joints.
  - Reduces temperature by 5 degrees - relative to plain sheet?
  - Also comes in tile widths - 3.2ft.
