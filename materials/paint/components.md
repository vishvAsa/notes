## Clear finishes
- carrier, or solvent - preserves the finish liquid in the container and evaporates as the finish dries. Oft petroleum-based or synthetic materials; or linseed oil or water.
- binder, or resin - protects the surface.
  - lacquer, natural oils, shellac, and varnish
  - Clear coat paint - Polyurethane based.
- Additives 
  - fungicidal chemicals.
  - Chemical dryers (in case of slow drying linseed oil binders)

### Lacquer
- mostly acrylic; sometimes nitrocellulose
- usually has high solvent and VOC content

### Natural oils
- Linseed oil from flax and tung oils are popular.
- they cure by absorbing oxygen and hardening rather than by evaporating solvents and simply leaving behind a binder.
- Some penetrate wood (eg linseed oil), others coat it as well (due to added PU type binders)

#### Drying time
- raw linseed oil has a drying time of about 3-7 days for each coat
- "Boiled," "heat treated," or "polymerized" linseed oil dry faster.
- Sometimes  metallic drying/ siccative agents are added to cut drying time to a day.

#### India choices
- Airplane brand double boiled linseed oil has additives: lead, cobalt and zinc.

### Shellac
- Shellac uses ethanol solvent made from corn.
- shelf life of only six months
- dries quickly, you can apply many coats in a short timeâ€”dust has less time to settle, which makes desirable results easier to obtain.

### Varnish
- acrylic or urethane binder + drying oil

### Water-Based Sealer (acrylic or urethane binder)
