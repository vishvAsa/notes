Paint based waterproofing considered [elsewhere](../paint/waterproofing).

## Silicone
### Efficacy
- Silicone sealants can stay waterproof for around 20 years, but this varies according to different factors including temperature, UV exposure and the chemical properties of the sealed materials.

### Application
- The majority of sealants sold today cure at the rate of 2-3mm per 24 hours.
  - this is exactly why they will not last forever in the tube. They have an especially short shelf life if in hot and humid conditions. 
  - Keeping them in the refrigerator will help extend their days, and keeping nozzles always attached will also help them cure slowly.
  - Check expiry date when buying.
- Primers improve adhesion by 20%.

## Butyl Flashing Tape
- More expensive than silicone. 1300 INR for 5cm*20m roll in 2021.

## Modified silicone MS Polymer
- Aka Mastic
- a polyether backbone with reactive silyl functionality (telechelic).
  - There are 2 kinds: a dimethoxysilyl (DMS) with 2 reactive groups (each side) on it and a trimethoxysilyl (TMS) with 3 reactive groups on it, making it a faster curing system than the DMS type.
- more expensive (3x) but it doesn't dry once opened like silicone 
- it takes much more time to cure
