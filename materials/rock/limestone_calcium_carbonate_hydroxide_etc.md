Limestone, sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite. 

(Quick)Lime is CaO.

Calcium Hydroxide is Ca(OH)2. 

## Uses
- Fertilizers (Natural and artificial)
  - Limestones enriched in phosphate by the chemical action of ocean waters is used in NPK making.
- cement
- acidity regulation

### Lime uses
- natural paints, plaster
- Steel making
- Heat (can be weaponized, as igniter, yields noxiuous gas)
  - CaO (s) + H2O (l) ⇌ Ca(OH)2 (aq) (ΔHr = −63.7 kJ/mol of CaO)
- Roman concrete

## Sources
- Sea shells
- Natural deposits

## Deposits
### India
