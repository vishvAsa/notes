All alkaline.

## Limestone
Limestone, sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), usually in the form of calcite or aragonite.

### Uses
- Fertilizers (Natural and artificial)
  - Limestones enriched in phosphate by the chemical action of ocean waters is used in NPK making.
- cement
- acidity regulation
- Making Lime CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)
- Limelight when heated to 2400 deg.
- powder as weapon

### Sources
- Sea shells
- Mineral deposits in rocks
  - Rock type: igneous (Carbonetite), metamorphic (Marble) and sedimentary
  - Geologic age Achaean (>2,500 million years), Proterozoic (between 2,500 and 600 MY), Palaeozoic (600 to 250 MY), Mesozoic (250 to 65 MY) and Cenozoic (65 to Present)

Natural deposits in India

- The metamorphic limestone deposits, generally in India, are of Archaean Age and are located in Coimbatore, Salem and Madurai regions of Tamil Nadu, Dharwar region of Karnataka and Aravalli region of Rajasthan
- Proterozoic sedimentary limestone deposits starting from dense cluster around Cuddapah and Kornool region, Bhima basin in Gulbarga, Katni, Satna and Damoh regions of Vindhya Range, etc.
- The paleozoic age sedimentary rock formations in India are known for extensive coal deposits in Bihar, Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Maharashtra
- Mesozoic Period except sedimentary limestone deposits occur in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. extensive limestone deposits in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
- Cenozoic Period - Kachchh Gujarat, Meghalaya (Jaintia district)


## Lime
(Quick)Lime is CaO. Aka suNNa.

### Sources
- Limestone
- Mineral deposits

### Uses
- natural paints, plaster, flooring
- Steel making
- Heat
  - CaO (s) + H2O (l) ⇌ Ca(OH)2 (aq) (ΔHr = −63.7 kJ/mol of CaO)
  - Breaking rocks
  - can be weaponized, as igniter
- powder as weapon
- Roman concrete
- Food
  - acidity regulator, leavener
- Limelight


## Calcium Hydroxide
Calcium Hydroxide is Ca(OH)2.
