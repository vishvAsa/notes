## Clay tiles
- Oft turn black, collect dirt and moss.
- Dry very fast.

## Cermaic
- Ceramic tiles are made from natural clay that is mixed with water and molded. Creators apply a glaze to the tile to help protect it from water and scratches, then fire the clay in a kiln to harden it. 
- Glazes are a glassy coat on tiles. Can use heavy metals (including lead) to generate colors and textures. This can leach out.

### Porcelain 
- Clay used is of slightly higher density and is fired longer. Can be further vitrified. Properties more or less analogous to vitrified tiles.

## Vitrified tiles. 
- The clay is mixed with quartz and feldspar before it is heated in the kiln. These extra ingredients melt, creating a glass element inside the tile. This glass component makes the vitrified files very hard and resistant to any type of absorption.
- Color: Vitrified tiles, unlike ceramic tiles, are rarely glazed. Instead, a dye is mixed in with the clay before it is fired. This dye makes the clay a uniform color, so even if the vitrified tile is scratched, the color will stay the same.
- Polish: Instead of being glazed, vitrified tiles are either polished or unpolished.
- Strength: more strength and scratch resistance than marble or granite which are more prone to breakage.
- Need a stronger adhesive than ceramic tiles.

### Absorption resistence
- Vitrified tile has an absorption rate of 0.50 percent, which is nearly-frost proof, while ceramic tile ranges from 7 to 3 percent, making it unsuitable for outdoor applications.
- The surface of ceramic tiles directly improves indoor air quality because it cannot be penetrated by allergens such as pollen, dust, or dirt.
