## Introduction

- The worlds of ideas are distinct from the directly experienced world of sensations. They can be accessed only by the intellect (aka the questioning mind) and assessed by sentiment.
- Motivation
  - These are my personal maps to those worlds. The process of making them was quite addictive and satisfying once. I once had an obsessive (unpragmatic) need to understand everything from the very basic principles. "न ख्यातिलाभपूजार्थं ग्रन्थोऽस्माभिरुदीर्यते । स्वबोधपरिशुद्ध्यर्थं ब्रह्मविन्-निकषाश्मसु ॥"
  - These were written for my own edification- often as part of _thinking aloud_ or _thinking carefully_. If you find it useful - great!

### Self criticism:
- Many are very unoriginal, terse, incomplete and incorrect.
- Sometimes the stuff is pedantic. The truly surprising things are not adequately highlighted.

### Currency and updates
- They were mostly written and updated when I was trying my hand at academic research. Now, I only get to most of them very rarely.
- Still, I love comments and corrections (not that I've ever received any!).
