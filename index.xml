      <description>Europe Economic union Many countries in Europe are part of a union which allows easy travel and relatively free trade with low taxation. Many are also use a common currency, Euro, issued by a central bank.
A big part of the motivation for doing this was to quell fears that the strong German economy might again give rise to an expansionist war-machine.

      <description>Plant cells have organelles called platelets which enable photosynthesis of food.
Predation Catching food Predators may be mostly static, lying in wait for prey to come to them. Or, they may actively move and entrap or chase down food.
Baiting Predators may attract food organisms to a certain location for entrapment. Eg: brightly colored flowers of the venus fly trap, the attractive tail of the rattle-snake.
Overcoming a single prey A prey is usually overcome using asphyxiation, bleeding, cutting, crushing or poison.</description>

      <description>Conditional distributions and notation Got observations of events: RV \(X\) took values \(\set{x_{i}}\), deduce/ model the process causing those events. In general, we want to model the conditional distributions \(f_{X_r|X_{\lnot r}}\). Often, we use the alternate notation \(Y = X_r\) and \(X = X_{\lnot r}\).
Connection to modeling marginal density Note that \(X_{\lnot r}\) may be empty, so that marginal/ unconditional distribution modeling - which is estimating \(f_X(X)\) - is a special case of conditional distribution modeling.</description>

      <description>Aka supervised learning. There are a variety of prediction problems depending on the combination of problem components described below.
Core problem Input and response variables A label/ target/ response/ dependent \(L\) depends on some predictor/ input/ independent variable \(X\) (a set of features/ covariates).
Range of X and L Input space is \(D\) dimensional.
\(range(L)\) may be a subset of a vector space. It may be continuous or discrete.
Labeling rule sought The agent/ decision rule produced by the learning algorithm must label \(L\) some unlabeled test point(s) \(X\), after some observations/ examples/ training points \(S\).</description>

      <description>Total variation distance between distributions Aka Statistical distance. Sample space X. \(\Del(D, D&amp;rsquo;) = 2^{-1} \sum_{x \in X} |D(x) - D&amp;rsquo;(x)|\): \(\in [0,1]\). But, \(\sum_{x \in X} (D(x) - D&amp;rsquo;(x)) = 0\).
Visualize as space between probability curves. Total prob under either curve is 1.
Largest deviation in event probability For event \(E \subseteq X: \max_{E \subseteq X} |Pr_{D}(x \in E) - Pr_{D&amp;rsquo;}(x \in E)| = \Del(D, D&amp;rsquo;)\). Or, max (signed) area between curves covered by E is at most half the total area.</description>

      <description>Discrete L: Response probability: Discriminative models Boolean valued functions One can use boolean valued functions to get deterministic models of the form \(y = f(x)\). These functions are considered in the boolean functions survey and the computational learning theory survey.
Probability from regression models Take any (continuous variable regression) model \(f: X \to [0, 1]\). Such a model can be interpreted as modeling the probability distribution \(f_L\).
Advantages of modeling probability The classifier doesn&amp;rsquo;t care whether \(C_{1}\) is called class 1 or class 100.</description>

      <description>Specification and classes A distribution is often specified by a pdf or a cdf involving certain parameters. Or it may be specified by a stochastic process generating some values: ie in terms of other other distributions.
Sometimes, the density specified need not even be proper (sum/ integrate to 1) to be useful: Eg: In applying the conditional probability inversion trick.
Notation If the pdf of \(X\) is a member (identified by the parameter \(p_1\)) of the function family \(\set{f(p)}\), we write \(X \distr f(p_1)\).</description>

      <description>Certain numbers reveal the current evaluation of the economy. The health of the economy can be roughly viewed in terms of the financial health and confidence of 4 major components: consumers, banks, non-bank businesses, government.
Eg: Prices of critical commodities (like oil), value of index funds, growth in real estate prices, government debt, public debt.

      <description>Notation Consider a function class \(C\) defined on the input space \(X\). Let \(p\) be a probability measure on \(X\).
Euclidean Vector spaces The definition of standard inner product and \(l_p\) norms can be extended to work with function spaces, when they are regarded as vector spaces with dimensionality equal to \(|X|\); while also considering the \(p\). These are described in the vector spaces survey.
Metric space using Disagreement probability One can define a metric space using the norm \(d(f, g) = Pr_p(f(x) \neq g(x))\).</description>

      <description>Players, strategies, utilities Players \(P = \set{p_{i}}\). A strategy is not a move but an algorithmorithm to make moves; compare with decision procedure in decision theory in statistics ref. \(S_{i}\): strategy set of \(p_{i}\). Strategy vector (strategy profile): \(s = (s_{1}, .. s_{n})\). \(s_{-i}\): s sans \(s_{i}\).
Mixed/ randomized strategies Independent mixed strategy of i: a Prob Distr over \(S_{i}: D_{i}\).
Mixed strategy profile, perhaps \(p_{i}\) coordinated: Probability distribution over \(\times_{i}S_{i}\): D.</description>

      <description>Academic hiring follows a different pattern.
Selectivity Hiring people is generally easier than getting rid of them. So, when possible, businesses create interview processes which have low ’false positive’ rates - even at the cost of high ’false negative’ rates.
Process Often, specialized recruiters are used to make initial contacts with people - in order to get an idea of where how the candidate may fit the company’s needs. That person then may pitch the candidate to potential hirers.</description>

      <description>Capital Bank owners make an investment - this is called the capital. A part of the bank’s capital goes towards increasing the size of the capital.
Liabilities/ Borrowed money They also borrow money from investors - in other words, investors deposit money in a bank. The bank promises a return on investment to the depositor, but this return on investment is but a part of the profit the bank makes using that money.</description>

      <description>Automated processing Sensory perception involves not only the sense organs, but also specialized circuitry in the brain. This is akin to input devices + software drivers in the case of computers.
Perception often involves attention, but all processing is non-explicit and non-verbal.
Signal sparsity The brain deduces most of what it knows from scant filtered signals.
Eyes keep moving around from nose to eye to lips etc.. So actual information observed is actually small, the brain does not know what is happening outside this small area.</description>

      <description>Aka random process. T-valued random variable/ state sequence indexed by \(r\in R\) (often time): visualize as a time-series - a directed graph which is a straight line.
Multiple coin toss processes Consider a sequence of coin tosses. Let \(X_i\) model the outcome of the i-th toss.
Bernoulli process: iid bernoulli trials: the same coin is tossed multiple times, that is \(\forall i: X_i \distr p\). Resulting from such a process is the Binomial distribution for \(\sum_i X_i\).</description>

Addition, scalar multiplication Addition of vectors is naturally defined: \((u + v)_i = u_i + v_i\). Scalar multiplication is similarly defined.
Geometric model: coefficient sequence Can be interpreted as a point in the cartesian space \(F^{n}\); but which point? That depends on what the basis vectors model, the units, the inner product between them.

      <description>Economies generally keep cycling through periods of booms and busts (described below). This is due to heuristic way in which demand and supply are balanced.
Boom To meet demand, industry in certain sectors grow - often on borrowed money, counting on future profits. Industries indeed produce profit for some time, but production keeps increasing until production exceeds demand.
During this time, the industries’ economic value - or at least their evaluation by the securities market- grows.</description>

      <description>Aka smRti.
Procedural vs declarative knowledge Knowledge can be declarative or procedural depending on whether it is stored using some language (which may include words, sounds, pictures, videos, touch, taste etc..); here we are concerned with the former kind. Procedural memory is considered separately.
Importance Memory (short and long term) is fundamental to computation (mechanical or animal). Like thoughts, memory is like a mosaic, rather than linear.
Classification, uses Depending on how quickly stored information (memory) is forgotten, memory is classified into short and long term.</description>

      <description>Banks initially often may try to restructure the debt - allow later payment, increase installments, reduce interest etc..
Recovery attempts Defaulters borrow money from banks but fail to pay back. THen, the bank employs various means - seizing assets of defaulters or better yet those who guaranteed payment, shaming and illegal coercion in some cases to recover the money. Defaulters with political power often get their debts written off.

      <description>Branches Government has 3 main arms: Legislative (to make laws and oversee policies), Executive (to provide services as designed at a high level by the legislature) and Judiciary (to take care of grievances, punish wrong-doing).
Importance Government design determines the type and the quality of the services provided by the government. Bad governments are often a result of bad design.
Legislature Legislatures have great power because they determine the laws/ policies; the executive and judiciary merely execute them.</description>

When \(p=1/2\), \(X\) is called a Rademacher RV.
Properties \(E[X] = p\). \(Var[X] = p-p^{2}\). Same as Bin(1, p).
Odds of success \(\frac{p}{1-p}\). This function is used in gambling (see economics survey).
Multiple coin-toss Aka Binomial distribution.
This is the probability of \(x\) successes in \(n\) trials. \

      <description>Y = g(X).
Use \(Pr(g(X) \in A) = Pr(X \in g^{-1}(A))\). So, given CDF, PDF of X, can deduce CDF of g(X) and thence derive PDF of g(X).
Using \(\frac{dg^{-1}(Y)\) If g is monotone in \((x, x+\gd x)\): \(p_{X}(x)\gd x \approx p_{Y}(y)\gd y\), taking \((x, x+\gd x)\) to \((y, y+\gd y)\) using g: So \(p_Y(y) = p_{X}(x)|\frac{dx}{dy}| = p_{X}(g^{-1}(y))|\frac{d g^{-1}(y)}{dy}| \): so maximum probability density changes with variable change.
If g is not continuous, but \(\exists\) partition \(A_{0}, .</description>

      <description>Motivating a hired employee to do his job involves ensuring that his pleasure/ satisfaction (perhaps even pain) coincides with benefits and loss of the company.
The best case is when the employee, by nature, cares deeply about doing his job well - which is why good hiring is important.
Another alternative is to do this using rewards and threats. Research shows that for menial/ mechanical tasks, this works; but for creative work, this approach is counter-productive.</description>

      <description>Random vector A random vector is an n-dim vector \(X = (A_{i})\), which are a bunch of jointly distributed random variables. Similarly, \(X\) can be a \(m \times n\) random matrix.
Below, we consider \(X = (X_1, X_2)\), where \(X_1:(S_1; F_1, v_1) \to R_1\) and \(X_2:(S_2; F_2, v_2) \to R_2\).
A random vector is itself a random variable \(X:(S_1 \times S_2; F_1 \times F_2, v) \to (R_1 \times R_2)\).
Marginalization The marginalization properties of the joint/ product probability space leads to: \(Pr(X_1 \in E_1, X_2 \in S_2) = Pr(X_1 \in E_1)\), so \(\int_{E_1 \times S_2} f_X(x) dv = \int_{E_1} \int_{x_2 \in S_2} f_{X}(x_1, x_2) dv_2 dv_1 = \int_{E_1} f_{X_1}(x_1)dv_1\).</description>

      <description>Example applications, modeling intricacies, various interpretations of probability are discussed in the probabilistic modeling survey.
Probability measure The following axiomatization is common to both frequentist and subjective interpretation of probability.
Take sample space \(S\), sigma algebra \(F\). The probability measure is a special measure \(v:F \to [0,1]\); so operates over sets, like CDF. Additionally, the general additivity property (described in algebra survey) is usually assumed.
Other properties of the measure: should be countably additive over disjoint sets: \(\gs\) additive; \(v(\gO) = 1\).</description>

      <description>Many models often propose that behind the production of a sequence of observations, there are (possibly hidden/ latent) changes in internal state. They allow transition from one state to another to be stochastic.
Let the state at time t be \(X_{t}\). Let \(V\) be the set of possible states.

      <description>Aka concentration of measure inequalities.
Expectation based deviation bound (Aka Markov&amp;rsquo;s inequality). If \(X\geq 0\): \(Pr(X \geq a) \leq \frac{E[X]}{a}\): \(Pr(X \geq a)\) is max when \(X\) is 0 or a.
Averaging argument. If \(X\leq k\), \(c\mean Pr(X\leq c\mean) + k(1-Pr(X\leq c\mean)) \geq \mean\); so \(Pr(X\leq c\mean) \leq \frac{k-\mean}{k-c\mean}\).
This technique is used repeatedly in other deviation bounds based on variance and moment generating functions.

      <description>Exponential family of distributions Generated by h and feature function, parametrized by t \(x \in X \subseteq R^{d}\); Base measure \(h: R^{d} \to R\), feature extraction fn \(\ftr: R^{d} \to R^{k}\). \(p(x; t) \propto h(x)e^{\dprod{t,\ftr(x)}} \). Exponential family: \(\set{p(x; t) \forall t}\). \(\ftr_i()\) aka potential functions.
Can be written as \(p(x; t) = h(x)e^{\dprod{t,\ftr(x)} - G(t)} = Z^{-1}h(x)e^{\dprod{t,\ftr(x)}}\), where \(G(t) = \log \sum_{X}h(x)e^{\dprod{t,\ftr(x)}}\) is the log partition fn.

      <description>Taxation In exchange for government services, people and businesses pay taxes on their incomes/ gains (any increase in wealth). So, the government collects taxes on behalf of its citizenry.
Taxation rate and service level Some highly ’socialist’ countries (Eg: Scandinavian countries, France etc..) tend to have high taxation rates, and provide excellent services to their citizens in return. Other countries, like USA, have low taxation rates and in return provide low-quality public services.</description>

      <description>Workers collectively have greater bargaining power while negotiating terms of employment (salary, benefits, leave, penalties) with their employer. To this end, they form trade unions.
Breakdown of negotiations When negotiations with employers break down, they go on strike - that is halt work without pay, thereby causing loss to the employers. Employers sometimes try to get around the problem by hiring new workers who will accept poorer conditions and work - which often leads to violence and damage, and hence is an unattractive option.</description>

Quantification Government deficit is often measured as a percentage of the GDP, which is much larger than the actual income of the government alone. Anything over 10% is considered too high.
Expectations without willingness to spend Often people expect unrealistically good public services from the government, without the willingness to spend a proportionate fraction of their income.</description>

Universal health care Universal Health Care in many countries is free or low cost.
Quality The quality in many countries is good - In France there are even house-calls. In other countries beset with inefficient executive branches, like India, public health care is often low quality - though even there, there are islands of high quality.
Delays, overuse Free health care is often overused, leading to resource scarcity given that a limited amount of money is alloted for health care.</description>

      <description>Schools Most countries provide free universal compulsory primary education for children. Quality varies.
Tuition Access to prestigious universities/ schools may be limited, so there is often a competitive exam; for which there often exists special tuition/ cram schools.
Higher education In some countries (like Scandinavia, France), government heavily subsidizes higher education; while in others students must mostly rely on other sources, and accrue huge debts.</description>

      <description>Estimate parameters using statistics The distinction between choosing parametric and non-parametric approaches are considered in the decision theory section.
Statistic, estimator A statistic \(\hat{t} = \hat{g}(X)\) is a function of the sample \(X\); an observable random variable. When it is used to estimate some parameter, it is called an estimator. t can be estimated by estimating \(\gth\).
Point estimation of the parameter If \(\hat{t}\) tries to approximate \(t\), it is an estimator.</description>

They sometimes offer tax-breaks in the initial years to attract businesses. They also try to achieve concentration of talent by offering pre-setup infrastructure and by setting up special economic zones where companies will get tax benefits.</description>

They know what classes of problems are easy to solve. So, they often draw on a mental library of functions, composition rules to create, for example a convex program.
Dealing with strict inequality constraints Replace with non-strict inequalities.
Use equivalent formulations (for convexity?) You can always replace \(f_0(x)\) or \(f_i(x)\) \
with a \(p(f_i(x))\) if p is monotonically increasing with \(f_i\), and if you can translate between \(\argmin f_0(x)\) and \(\argmin p(y)\) or between \(f_i(x) \leq 0\) and \(p(y) \leq c\).</description>

      <description>The problem Importance, efficient solvability Superset of LP. Many problems in nature are convex optimization problems. Many non-convex problems have convex equivalents : see section on modelling/ specifying optimization problems.
(Nesterov, Nemorinsky) For any convex optimization problem, there exists self concordant barrier functions; so interior point methods and barrier methods can be made applicable: This is a non constructive proof. So, there exists a polynomial time algorithm for every convex optimization problem, but you will find it with certainty only if you can find these self concordant barrier functions.</description>

Let \(\set{X_{i}}\) iid. \(\hat{X}_{n} = n^{-1}\sum^{n} X_{i}\). As \(var[\hat{X_{n}}] = \stddev^{2}/n \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), Weak law: \(\hat{X}_{n}\) is a consistent estimator of \(\mean\).
Normalness of estimator distribution Aka Central limit theorem (CLT)
Take estimator \(U_{n} = \frac{\bar{X} - \mean}{\frac{\stddev}{\sqrt{n}}}\). \(lt_{n\to \infty} Pr(U_{n} \leq u) = \int_{-\infty}^{u} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-t^{2}/2}dt\): so approaches CDF of N(0,1): See convergence of moment generating function (MGF) below.</description>

      <description>Abstract data types When data is stored, we often want to perform various operations (ie evaluate mathematical functions) on it.
Abstract data type is a mathematical construct of a data-store, defined by the operations which can be performed over it, and consistency rules (which define the effect of the aforementioned operations on the stored data). For example, a stack can be defined using push, pop operations, with constraints such as pop(push(stack, x)) = x.</description>

      <description>In general, memory declines with age. But, for a few people, it remains clear and functional. [National Geographic, Nov 2007]
Metrics White matter naturally degrades as we age—causing disrupted communication between brain regions and memory deficits—after conducting a battery of cognitive tests and brain scans on 93 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 93. The observed weakening of these brain network interactions (associated with default state and executive functions) was significantly correlated with a measured decline of cognitive functions as a result of aging.</description>

      <description>Comparison to computer It is easy to think of the mind in relation to the body as being analogous to software being in relation to a computer. The state of a computer is ever changing - yes; and we can refer to specific things when necessary. Eg: &amp;ldquo;program X is running inside the computer, so it is presenting this output&amp;rdquo;.
Behaviorism Academic history This was a reaction to focus on internal states and feelings rather than environmental stimuli in western study of human psyche and behavior.</description>

      <description>Using assymetric key cryptography One simple way of authentication is to encrypt and return a challenge message using one&amp;rsquo;s secret key.
Using a password This is very common - eg: it is used over to log into terminals.
To beat snooping, passwords are transmitted over a secure channel (eg: ssh vs rsh).
One-time passwords Passwords may be spoofed - even over a secure channel by an adversary who jumps into a session and replays the password message to, for example change the password.</description>

      <description>Grammar Definition A grammar specifies a language by describing structural rules which can be used to accept or reject a sentence. So, each grammar is associated with a language.
It is fully described by (Variables, Terminal chars/ alphabet, Start symbol, Production rules).
Production rules are of the form: string including variable V \(\to\) string with variables and terminal symbols, formed by replacing \(V\) with somwething else.
A given string is accepted if, starting with the start symbol, using a finite number of production rules, one can arrive at the string.</description>

      <description>ATM-s Banks usually have a network of ATM machines whence cash may be drawn and deposits made. A debit card is issued for their use. They may be associated with an incentive to encourage its use: why?
Use of ATMs maintained by other banks results in fees, eg: 2$ for BoA; which may be refunded by the bank with the account.
Remote deposits Banks often offer smart-phone applications or websites from which deposits can be made.</description>

      <description>Definition When a company declares bankruptcy, it says that it is incapable of meeting all of its financial commitments/ liabilities. All of its agreements with trade-unions are then also canceled.
The business’s assets can be liquidated (seized, valued and sold) to satisfy its liabilities. Also, the company may be taken over and restructured; and the new owner can repay outstanding debts.
Rescue Motivation The government is often motivated to rescue failing businesses to prevent negative consequences like job loss, reduction in national pride etc.</description>

      <description>Output \ Actuation This involves basic muscle movements, often in complex patterns, resulting in more complex automatic behavior like walking, running, using hands and speaking.
Large areas of the brain are associated with the use of hands.
Degree of automation Behavior can be automatic or not, depending on the extant to which declarative memory is used; the latter class is called executive function, which involves planning, decision, error control. General aspects of cognition which underly this are considered elsewhere.</description>

Efficient operations  Single row lookup. Scan row ranges/ prefixes. Scan column, timestamp ranges  Advantages  Scales easily, shards as necessary (during &amp;lsquo;compaction&amp;rsquo; times). Shards are called tablets. Shards may be overloaded before the unpredictable compaction times, so intelligent key distribution may be desirable.  Disadvantages  Columns can be grouped into column family.</description>

      <description>Intro The body language is indeed a language with words and phrases. The body can communicate even when there are no spoken words. The primary function of body language is to express emotions and status among surrounding animals; and its vocabulary is specialized for that. Using body language, one can speak multiple words simultaneously.
Importance of mastering it Body language is widely understood, often unconsciously. Bad skill at it is often results in miscommunication.</description>

Bounds on combinatorial quantities Bounds on n! (Stirling)\(n!\approx \sqrt{2n\pi} (\frac{n}{e})^{n}\). \why
Bounds on (a choose b) \(\binom{a}{b} = \frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!} \approx \frac{a^{a}}{\sqrt{2n\pi} b^{b}(a-b)^{a-b}}\) for large a, b and a-b.
So: \(\binom{a}{b} \leq (\frac{ea}{b})^{b}\). \(\lceil \frac{a}{b}\rceil \leq \frac{a-1}{b}+1\). \(\frac{e^{m}}{\sqrt{em}}&amp;lt; \frac{m^{m}}{m!}\leq \sum \frac{m^{i}}{i!} = e^{m}\). \((\frac{a}{b})^{b} &amp;lt; \binom{a}{b} &amp;lt; a^{b}/b!\).

      <description>It is the weave of the fabric (the size and number of holes) that determines breathability or resistance to air movement. Any woven or knit fabric will breathe - even if the weave is made of rubber strands.
If the yarn on the outside of the garment is thinner than the yarn on the inside of the garment, capillary action will pull water to the outside. The increased surface area (not hollow fibre cores) of the thin yarn gives the water more space to spread out.</description>

      <description>Intro Sometimes, cells in an organism go rogue; they don&amp;rsquo;t listen to signals from other cells, and start reproducing and form a tumor; they hog the nutrient supply coming to that region. As they reproduce, they make inexact copies of themselves, and they fight with each other for the limited nutrient supply: the &amp;lsquo;survival of the fittest&amp;rsquo; game is seen within the tumor, and repeatedly one type of cell comes to dominate others.</description>

      <description>Tax is levied on one’s gains realized using the sale of security holdings or from interest/ dividend income on such securities, with some quirky rules.
Term Long-term capital gains (Eg: selling stock after holding it for a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate.
Subscribing to a dividend reinvestment plan complicates calculation of capital gains.
Wash sale One can offset gains obtained by selling some securities by selling securities on which one has made a loss - but it is forbidden to buy the same security again immediately after doing so (wash sale).</description>

      <description>Belt Useful not only for holding up pants tightly to the waist, ensuring good weight distribution, but also enables attachments like pouches.
Buy a synthetic material belt, ideally one which can be used in professional circumstances, with very little metal (no big belt buckle), so that it need not be removed for airport security checks.
Cargo pants/ shorts Can be found in military stores or online. Professional look is achievable.</description>

      <description>Abstraction Aka general abstract nonsense. Abstract from sets and relations to categories and morphisms.
Category (Class ob(C) of objects, morphisms or arrows hom(C), composition op: \(\cdot\)) with \(\cdot\) identity, associative \(\cdot\). Category Eg: Set, \(Vect_{k}\).
Small category: aka CAT: both ob(C) and hom(C) are sets, rather than classes.
Morphisms Homomorphism: A structure (identity, inverse elements, and binary ops) preserving funciton f: f(x)=3x preserves addition. Isomorphism: both f and \(f^{-1}\) are homomorphisms.</description>

      <description>Displaying, accepting and writing to files characters readable by humans are common tasks in many programs, irrespective of language.
So, common standards have evolved to represent these characters with natural numbers or characters visible on most English keyboards or arbitrary bytes.
ASCII This represents the Latin alphabet plus some common characters. Range: 0:255.
Special characters include control characters.
Control characters Carriage return (move cursor to beginning of current line), line-feed (start a new line), tab (a long horizontal space).</description>

      <description>These are especially useful for highly liquid items Eg: negotiable securities. Portfolio decisions can be based on looking at the chart for the appropriate time period. With a chart, one can observe features like support and resistence levels. Thence, one can decide whether it is a good time to buy or sell an equity.
This is because charts contain in them the evaluations of large fund managers etc.. But that can be misleading in case of bubbles.</description>

      <description>Aka transactional/ current account. A checking account allows bank customers to write checks - so it can be used as money. It does yields much less interest than savings account - often nothing.
Check redemption The person to whom the check is presented can redeem it for cash at his bank, which communicates with the issuers bank to get money from the issuer’s account. If the issuer’s account lacks sufficient funds, a penalty is imposed to discourage such irresponsibility.</description>

Manufacturing China has a trade surplus relative to the USA. It is a manufacturing hub.
Media China, due to tight censorship, does not seem to be a hot-spot for internet businesses. It blocks Facebook, twitter - anything which can be used to organize subversion of the government.

      <description>Look at maximal cliques, pick a set of such cliques so that every edge is in some clique, make corresponding clique-nodes, make a tree by adding paths between cliques passing through shared-vertex-set nodes.
Eg: 1-2-3 has clique tree (1,2)-2-(2,3).
G can have multiple clique tree.
Junction tree property Take any path in the clique tree between cliques \(C_1\) and \(C_2\); then \(C_1 \inters C_2\) appears in every shared-vertex-set node inbetween them.</description>

Use Summarizing data is important for generalization, understanding future data points.
Supplying labels to unlabeled data; thence classifying new data-points. Eg: Face recognition using Eigenfaces. Use to estimate distribution support and thence in novelty detection.
Criteria: Continuity vs compactness Consider a starfish: The continuity critierion will identify the 5 arms as 5 clusters, but the comactness criterion will fail.</description>

      <description>Fingerprinting This codes can also be used as error detection codes.
Chinese reminder code Codes which use a mod p, with rand p. \(\hat{F}(a)\) elements will use diff fields; so not preferred.
Checking equality A picks rand prime p between 1 and \(k = n^{3}\); Sends (a mod p, p) to B; B says &amp;lsquo;=&amp;rsquo; if \(a \equiv b \mod p\).
\(Pr_{p}(a \equiv b \mod p|a \neq b) \leq n^{-1}\): num(p with \(a \equiv b mod p\) when \(b \neq a\)) or, \(num(p | (a-b)) \leq n^{-1}\) as \(a-b \in [0, 2^{n}-1]\); so \(Pr(p|a-b) &amp;lt; \frac{n}{\Pi(n^{3})} = \leq \frac{n\ln n}{n^{3}} \leq \frac{1}{n}\) Using Prime number theorem.</description>

Wear a warm clothing a few minutes before stepping out - then, air will be trapped inside the clothes.
Accesorize use faceguards, gloves, etc.. for extremities. This provides additional comfort. Eg: a hood not attached to the jacket provides improved mobility.
Maintenance Look for machine washable and dryable clothes.</description>

Readability (ease of understanding) can be accomplished by a combination of good variable naming, function and file size and comments - in that order of preference.
Comments are the last resort (as they get out of sync), but should be quite copious when necessary (to communicate design choices, problems, describing obscure language features etc.</description>

      <description>Interpolation See approximation theory ref.
Root finding Find \(x: f(x) = 0\).
Newton&amp;rsquo;s method Find the root iteratively. Take a local linear approximation \(g(x) = f(x_n) + \gradient f(x_n)^{T}(x-x_n)\) for \(f\), find its root; and use it as the next guess for the root.
\(x_{n+1} = x_{n} + \frac{f(x_{n})}{f&amp;rsquo;(x_{n})}\). For vector function \(f\): \(x_{n+1} = x_{n} + (\gradient(f(x_{n})))^{-1}f(x_{n})\).
This becomes the Newton&amp;rsquo;s method in optimization, when applied to solving for the optimality condition \(\gradient f(x) = 0\).</description>

There are two important subproblems: a] object or feature detection, b] measurement of position (distance and orientation) relative to a given feature. Solution approaches depend on the available tools - which may vary with situation.
Tools and approaches Localization using bounced light from lasers is essentially a solved problem; but lasers are expensive. Localization using light detected by passive sensors (eg: visible spectrum cameras) is harder.</description>

      <description>Problems In all of the following, we suppose that \(f_X(x)\) is given by a graphical model.
Model Estimation The most ambitious goal is to estimate the parameters associated with the distribution. This can often be accomplished by minimizing the log loss associated with the conditional distribution \(f_{X_i|X_{\nbd(i)}}\), once the structure of the underlying graphical model has been estimated (ie feature selection is done).

Ask questions that require more than a simple &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; answer to subtly encourage a shy or introverted person to keep talking.
Conduct interviews. Make them talk about themselves and their work.

      <description>Be courteous. Discourtesy implies not wanting friendship. Formality in politics and diplomacy was not invented without reason.
Courtesy is required for smooth operation, without misunderstandings, in the society of strangers. This is particularly useful, if help or information is later required from those strangers.
Common courtesys: Hold heavy doors open for people who are just behind you. Follow the queue system. Shake hands. Stand when others are standing.
Say please. But, don’t overdo it.</description>

      <description>Intro Sometimes criminals form organizations with internal rules and hierarchies. Organization may vary from loose to tight. Big criminal organizations, based on their geographic origin and organization, can be classified into Mafia (Sicily), &amp;lsquo;Ndranghetta (Calabria), Yakuza (Japan), Triad (China), Mexican cartels, Columbian cartels and others. Sometimes, as in the case of Yakuza, they are semi-open.
Some avoid particular endeavours - like drugs.

      <description>Motivation Data preparation often involves massaging attribute values to fit the requirements of operators/ models. For example, some operators cannot handle continuous values, others cannot handle polynomial values, some have problem with missing data.
Changing the range Ploynominal features can be converted to binomial features using a binary representation.
Binominal features can be treated as numeric inputs.
Continuous valued features can be converted to discrete valued features by binning them. The bins may be defined by a regular grid on the range, or irregularly to ensure roughly equal cardinality.</description>

Dimensionality reduction Remove irrelevant/ less relevant features, merge duplicate features. Eg: synonymous words in documents.
Importance Treating duplicate features as if they were different harms ability to classify or cluster data points. Irrelevent features also harm predictive ability, by acting as noise.</description>

      <description>Overview, motivation Some discipline is necessary in order to avoid common errors which consume effort and resources. The below describes steps common to many problems including density estimation and classification.
Formulate the problem in decision theoretic terms properly - pick an appropriate &amp;lsquo;risk/ loss function&amp;rsquo; (possibly incorporating prior belief), a candidate feature set. Then fix a model family (possibly after a literature survey) and develop a model selection procedure. Then use empirical risk estimation using cross validation in order to avoid overfitting to training data.</description>

      <description>The conciseness and clarity of expression of branching and iterative operation in different languages is different.
Branching The if-else structure is the most basic decision structure, using which more convenient decision structures like the if-elseif.. structure is defined.
Matching a value Different branches of execution often depend on different tests performed over the value of an expression. This is provided in terms of the ’match with various cases’ construct.
Iterative operations The essential ingredients of an iteration are the starting state, the code to be executed and the termination condition.</description>

      <description>Decision lists Decision list is fully specified by a sequence of \(k\) variables \((x_{i})\) and outputs \(r(x_{i}), r&amp;rsquo;(x_k)\). It is like an &amp;lsquo;if .. elseif .. elseif .. else&amp;rsquo; statement. It can be visualised as a chain of variables, each with one outgoing edges representing an output.
In a d-decision list, \(d-CNF\)&amp;rsquo;s are used in place of \(\set{x_i}\).
Generality This can be writ as halfspace: \(sign(\sum 2^{k-i}x_{i}o(x_{i}))\).
We can write conjunctions, disjunctions as decision lists.</description>

Condition number of a matrix Condition number of Ax when x perturbed \(k = \sup_{\change x} \frac{\norm{A\change x}}{\norm{\change x}}\frac{\norm{x}}{\norm{Ax}} = \norm{A}\frac{\norm{x}}{\norm{Ax}} \leq \norm{A}\norm{A^{-1}}\) or \(\leq \norm{A}\norm{A^{+}}\) if A not square.
So, condition of \(A^{-1}b\) when b perturbed, \(k = \norm{A^{-1}}\frac{\norm{Ax}}{\norm{x}} \leq \norm{A}\norm{A^{-1}}\).

      <description>Definition Rate of change The differential function, aka derivative, is \
\(f&amp;rsquo;(x) = \frac{df}{dx}= \lim_{\change x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\change x) - f(x)}{\change x}\), if the limit exists.
Linear approximation view Hence, \(f(x + \change x) = f(x) + \change(x) f&amp;rsquo;(x)\), as \(\change x \to 0\). As the primary use of the differential function is to be able to make linear/ polynomial approximations to \(f\), one can view the differntial function as a measure of \(f(x + \change x) - f(x)\) as \(\change x \to 0\).</description>

      <description>Definition Fixed direction differential fn Aka directional derivative.
Fixing the direction \(v\), \(D_v(f)\) can be taken to map \(x\) to \(D_v(f)(x)\). So, \(D_v(f)(x): V \to F\) is a constricted version of the differential function \(D(f)(x)\).
\(df(x; h) = D_h(f)(x)= \lim_{\change t \to 0} \frac{f(x+\change th) - f(x)}{\change t} = \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}f(x + th)\). Aka Gateaux differential.

Computational efficiency - as in the case of Most variable subspace identification (PCA).
Noise reduction - it could be that many of the features in a vector are not very informative.
Latent factor modeling Problem Here, one derives generative models to describe affinity of one discrete variable (say \(U\)) with another (say \(V\)): eg: features and objects, documents and words.</description>

      <description>Display screens Liquid Crystal displays tend to be more ergonomically friendly than CRT tube monitors.
Quality Image quality Display screens vary in image quality parameters: screen size, maximum resolution: SVGA (800 x 600), XGA (1024 x 768), SXGA (1280 x 1024), or UXGA (1600 x 1200), contrast ratio.
They also vary in refresh rate, in the case of images generated from projection, as in CRT monitors or projectors: low refresh rate results in flicker and eye strain - especially from typing distance.</description>

      <description>Retail vs wholesale Retail business focuses on distributing goods to consumers, while making a profit. Wholesalers focus on selling goods in bulk at a lower price to other businesses and distributors. Eg in USA: Sam’s club, costco. In India: Metro.
Price discrimination Different people are willing to pay different prices for the same product, and retailers try to exploit this.
In general, retailers try to distinguish the two types of customers by offering lower prices only to those who participate in some undesirable process which costs extra time and attention- eg: waiting for a certain day to make a purchase, committing to purchase in advance, gathering coupons.</description>

      <description>Domain name To connect to an application on a remote computer, one needs to know the IP address of that computer, which is often supplied to the application externally - by a user for example. Strings, called domain names, tend to be easier to remember than IP addresses.
Translation So domain name resolution can be considered a sub-module used for translating domain names to IP addresses.

Feature extraction Document is a string of words; but want a simpler representation.
Maybe just the set of words which appear is most important: use word-counts. Maybe number of occurances is also important.
Burstiness First time a word appears, it is very informative; but its second occurance is much less surprising/ informative.</description>

      <description>Intro  Fault current is best sent to ground. This includes surge current and lightening current.  Structure  An electrode is stuck in a pit in the ground and fault current is directed to it. The ground should have low resistivity at all times. But ground resistivity varies with space and season. So, electroloytes are added. With regular earthing, salt and coal is added around the electrode. Salt dissipates gradually and increases conductivity in the surrounding ground.</description>

To use ACH, one needs to know the routing numbers/ ABA codes and the account numbers for the source and destination accounts.
Reversal/ availability The payer’s bank also has the right to reverse the transfer within a few days (5 in USA) - so funds may not be immediately available for withdrawal.</description>

      <description>Want the minimum dimensional embedding.
Formulation as matrix factorization (Shconberg). Take weighted adj matrix W. \(W_{i,j} = \norm{x_{i}-x_{j}}^{2} = x_{i}^{T}x_{i} + x_{j}^{T}x_{j} - 2x_{i}^{T}x_{j}\). Take \(X = (x_{i})\); Gram matrix \(G = X^{T}X\) normalized to have \(g_{i,i} = 1\); then \(W = 2.11^{T}-2G\). Then solve for G; then solve \(G = X^{T}X\) for X with min number of columns.

      <description>Fiber can be soluble and insoluble. Insoluble fibers aid bowel movement.
Soluble fiber helps reduce cholesterol, reduces sugar response after eating, normalizes blood lipid levels. Soluble fiber is not broken down until it reaches the large intestine where digestion causes gas (flatulence). In excessive amounts, soluble fiber causes high flatulance, cramps.
Fibers in legumes, such as peanuts, beans is mostly soluble fibers.
Tree Nuts have insoluble fibers.</description>

      <description>Procedures Code is often organized into different procedures, which may be invoked under different contexts with different arguments.
Mathematical functions A procedure can change state (has a side-effect) and maybe return a value, doesn’t naturally correspond to mathematical function which cannot do this. So a function, which cannot have side-effects, can be viewed as a special type of procedure.
C is a procedural programming language which is not structured.
Passing arguments to procedures Variables can be passed by reference, or by value.</description>

      <description>Entrepreneurship. The effect of governments on business operations and running is described elsewhere.
Funding stages Prototyping People with a good business idea may get ’seed money’ from an ’angel investor’ to make a prototype. The angel investors may well be governments or university funds.
Launch Then, they pitch it to venture capitalists who provide two rounds of funding in return for a share in the company.
Expansion A third round of funding, called the mezzannine funding, is then sought for a possible expansion phase, usually after the company is profitable.</description>

      <description>Relying on experts or algorithms One can mitigate risks by relying on experts or well-tested algorithms to manage funds. In USA, publicly traded companies which follow the value investing philosophy include: Berkshire Hathaway, BBTEX, Boyar, Tweedy Borwne, YACKX.
Index funds for a given economic sector simply invest in major companies in proportion to their market value. One relys on the less riskier supposition that the entire sector is likely to grow, rather than any single security belonging to that sector.</description>

      <description>Anticipated trade One agent makes a deal with another to buy a certain amount of an ’underlying’ security on a specified future date at a certain ’strike’ price. To satisfy this deal, the seller is obliged to buy the security - if he does not already hold it - on or before the due-date.
Motivation The seller is betting that the market price of the security on or before the due-date will be lower than the set price; and the buyer is betting that the market price will exceed the set-price on or after the due-date.</description>

      <description>Problem Say you start with a capital of 25. Then you fight your rival. If you win you add 1 to what you have, if you lose you subtract 1 from what you have. If you reach 0 you&amp;rsquo;re extinct. If your probability of winning is 49.5% calculate ~ the median number of fights you will last before going extinct. This will teaches you something about survivorship, background extinction and the fate of empires.</description>

y is called the bet liability.
Viability of the bet Rational B (who is not risk-averse) will enter the contract if according to his evaluation of a, a__x − (1 − a)y ≥ 0 or $a \geq \frac{y}{x+y}$.</description>

      <description>Associative nature of thought Thought about a certain concept is influenced strongly by (possibly weak) associations with other concepts.
Physiological reason Neurons which fire together wire together - they are highly social. Nature of human thought is associative.
Examples People, when asked to think about the past or future, tend to lean slightly back or forward. People when exposed to a crossword with polite words tend to exhibit more polite behavior.</description>

      <description>Importance of planning An individual earns money from employment when young and healthy; but eventually they retire or get sick- either early or after going old.
Many expenses are very predictable. Hence set up a retirement fund, children’s education fund, health/ emergency fund. Many people fail at doing this.
Goals Investment horizon and age One should be clear about the investment horizon: when does one intend to withdraw money from the fund, with what frequency etc.</description>

      <description>Overview In roughly descending order of importance:
 Easy to understand. Easy to modify. Few errors. High coding speed. High computational efficiency.  Understanding specifications In the industry, this involves surveying customers, rapid prototyping, talking to end-users etc.. In research, the specifications come from the research problem.
Complexity More complex code is harder to implement : sometimes, there one can make choices which lead to simpler code - by simplifying requirements or interface languages for example.</description>

      <description>Google docs Cell referencing Columns are numbered with letters and rows with numbers. A cell can be specified using a latter and a number.
When cell references are copied (perhaps as part of formulae), the references may be automatically changed in a certain way - this is called relative reference: Eg: The reference A20 used in cell A2, when copied to B2 will automatically be changed to B20.
When such change does not happen, we have absolute reference to a cell.</description>

      <description>GPU&amp;rsquo;s, implementing common graphics tasks on specialized circuits, speed up display tasks involved in personal computing.
High data parallelism GPU&amp;rsquo;s follow a dataflow architecture: Highly pipelined, parallel with many small cores - much more than CPU&amp;rsquo;s. Usually, these parallel cores are divided profitably and easily: Like one core for a bunch of pixels.
Earlier these processing elements were specialized for graphics, now these shaders are more programmable.
For general computing With GPGPU, one would Disguise program as geometry computation.</description>

      <description>Water table  Ground water is simply the subsurface water that fully saturates pores or cracks in soils and rocks. This water is consumed by evaporation, plants and human pumping, and is recharged by precipitation. Below the ground, at a certain level is the &amp;ldquo;saturated zone&amp;rdquo;. This is generally close to the level of water in a nearby surface water body. Above it is the &amp;ldquo;unsaturated zone&amp;rdquo;. In this unsaturated zone, there usually is at least a little water, mostly in smaller openings of the soil and rock; the larger openings usually contain air instead of water.</description>

Desktop A desktop/ workspace corresponds to a big area in the available screen space whence applications are launched, and within which statuses, widgets and windows are displayed.
There may be multiple workspaces on a device - especially in case of devices with limited screen size.
Layering Various windows, widgets and the desktop conceptually form a stack of various displays available to the user.</description>

      <description>Motivation and intro  People with narrow backgrounds (never having seen gifted and normal homeschooled kids, themselves products of &amp;ldquo;factory model&amp;rdquo; education) find it hard to appreciate the benefits of homeschooling, while finding it easy to see supposed downsides. Hence this section. Here we try to answer some common objections from our perspective. But, please see other objection lists below. Where possible we try to avoid repeating answers.:  NC.

      <description>As Polynomials Homogenous Forms refer to homogenous polynomials of degree k. They can be viwed as \(f:V^{k} \to F\).
They can be written as Tensor vector products, as in the case of quadratic forms.
Importance Differential functions of order \(k\) are actually homogenous forms.
Quadratic form Representation \(x^{*}Bx = \sum_{i,j} B_{i,j}x_{i}x_{j}\).
Reformulation: \(tr(x^{}Bx) = tr(Bxx^{})\).
Symmetrification If \(x^{}Bx \in R\): As \(B = H+ H&amp;rsquo; = \frac{B+B^{}}{2} + \frac{B-B^{}}{2}\), skew hermitian part can be ignored: \(x^{}Bx = x^{*}Hx\).</description>

Green consumption People might want to similarly enhance status among environmentally conscious people by making conspicuous green choices - even though a less conspicuous investment may have benefited the ecosystem more. Eg: Installing solar panels on street side of the house, Buying the distinctive Toyota Prius rather than other inconspicuous hybrid vehicles around 2010’s.</description>

Inference problems Find Pr(X=x) or \(Pr(X=x|Y=y)\). Inference algorithms may be exact or approximate.
Or find E[X] or \(E[X|Y=y]\).
Or find the mode of \(Pr(X=x|Y=y)\): as done in case of Maximum likelihood estimation.
Difficulty in calculating Pr(X=x) Pr(X=x) can be difficult to calculate analytically. One could specify \(Pr(X=x) = Z^{-1}f(x)\) by leaving the normalization constant Z unspecified, and describing only \(f(x)\).</description>

This is akin to the search for proofs.
Use rules of inference Eg: Modus ponens: \((p \land (p \implies q)) \implies q\). Strengthening and weakening of implications.

      <description>Insurance products, besides serving the main purpose of hedging to counter financial risk, often also function as investment in mutual funds.
Functioning As security This business takes advantage of the fact that risk of a particular kind (house burning down, theft, death), affects a small fraction of a population at any given time, with very high probability. So, it collects fees/ premiums from a large number of insured people, and compensates those on whom a bad event befalls.</description>

Applications Language models are useful in speech recognition, machine translation, handwriting recognition, machine translation, speech generation, (context sensitive) spelling correction etc..
Multi-set of words model This very simple model ignores word order - a very important information. It models $Pr(w_{1:m}) = \prod Pr(w_i)$; and the parameters of this model - the word occurrence probabilities - are easily estimated; and it is known to follow the Zipf&amp;rsquo;s law, which is a heavy tailed distribution.</description>

      <description>Both declarative (rule-based) and imperative specification of document display is possible.
A document element is defined to either be a command and or an environment - which are distinguished based on the input they accept.
Common commands, environments Common commands include section, subsection, paragraph, subsubsection, title, author. Common environments include list (itemize and enumerate), tabular etc..
Templates Rules which map commands and environments to imperative display rules are collected together in templates.</description>

      <description>Forensics Police visit a crime scene, collect and record evidence. Then they speculate events which might account for the evidence - the speculation may be done by professional &amp;lsquo;profilers&amp;rsquo;.
Arrest Entrapment The aim is sometimes to prevent, rather than punish crime after the fact. Entrapment can lead to confession of plans; but it can also act as a way by which police informants encourage people, who would otherwise not be competent or coherent to do so, to plan and very nearly commit a crime.</description>

      <description>Given a computer network, suppose that we want to get any $k$ given computers to communicate accurately and easily in order to provide a variety of services to the users. This involves many common/ separate tasks which can be implemented as separate modules, which inturn can be arranged as a stack or hierarchy of layers. For details, see software architecture survey.
Common layers are described below, with TCP/IP protocol stack as a specific common instantiation, which dominated other standards due to it being open-source.</description>

      <description>Classification noise Random noise vs Adversarial noise. Getting (x, l) instead of (x, c(x)).
Malicious noise: both x and c(x) corrupted.
Random Classification noise model Uniform noise \(\eta \leq \eta_{0} \in [0,.5)\); \(L\) given \(\eta_{0}\), also polynomial in \(\frac{1}{.5-\eta_{0}}\).
Statistical Query (SQ) learning model (Kearns). A \textbf{statistical query} (criterion, tolerance) = \((\chi, \tau)\) yields probability \(Pr_{x}(\chi)\) or \(E_{x}(\chi)\) of \(\chi\) over examples. \(\chi\) efficiently evaluatable, \(\tau\) not very tiny. \(L\) forms h using only statistical queries.</description>

Underlying distribution Naught known to the algorithm about process generating data; just asking for approximately best fit or \(\eps\) approx of the \(c\) with error \(\eta\). Even same example \(s\) can have different label \(l\) at different times: this could either be because of noise/ corruption of the label or because of the underlying distribution.</description>

B cells When activated: Secrete antibodies.
 Neutralizing antibodies bind to a virus and ensure that they can&amp;rsquo;t bind to cell receptors. Non-neutralizing antibodies bind to antigens on surface of infected cells - detected by natural killer cells.  Plasma cells  Some B cells become plasma cells, which secrete antibodies for years.</description>

Mapping between vector spaces For any field \(F\), can consider linear transformations \(A: F^{n} \to F^{m}\).
Applications, examples Vector spaces can model many real world things (see vector spaces ref), even functions. In all of these, linear transformations have deep meanings.
Over function spaces: Differentiation, integration, multiplication by fixed polynomial in \(P_n\).

      <description>Graph G = (V, E). Every edge has this label: t(e): The time during which interaction represented by e took place. Given \(G[t_{0}, t_{0}&#39;]\) (training interval), output a list of edges not presented in it, but present in \(G[t_{1}, t_{1}&#39;]\) (testing interval). Maybe want to output top n most likely-to-appear edges.
Motivation Security. Improving organizational efficiency by going beyond official hierarchy. Inferring missing links from observed network.

      <description>Examples include various java logging frameworks including log4j.
Requirements One is to be able to log at various levels, usually named debug, info, error etc..
Log messages should be informative and customizable: printing things like the name of the function where it originates, the class-name, the line number, the time, the log-message level etc..
Logging is to have a simple, yet expressive syntax for constructing messages.
One is to be able to set logging levels for various modules at various levels, so as to filter out relatively unimportant messages out of the log.</description>

Tolerance of the problem and of the algorithm to representation error and error in basic arithmetic computations is considered later.
Underflow avoidance Sometimes, in case of computations involving multiplication and division with very small numbers (eg: probability calculation), there is the chance of underflow: a small non-0 number \(x\) may be stored as 0; which would then lead to \(0\) and \(\infty\) results during later multiplication and division.</description>

      <description>Process design: Productivity and quality How to transform the shop-floor/ assembly process and the procurement/ design process to increase quantity and quality?
Quality/ quantity trade-off When the focus is on quantity, quality often suffers, as workers are provided incentives and punishments which, focusing on quantity, largely ignore quality. Quality control is often postponed to a later stage.
The Toyota process, observing that correcting/ tolerating mistakes can be costly, tries to ensure that they get it right the first time - workers have the ability to stop the assembly-line in order to fix a mistake when they make/ detect it.</description>

Determinant of square A Definitions Det(A) or \(|A|\) : The recursive defn. Cofactor of \(A_{1,1}\): \(C_{1,1}\) = det of submatrix (minor) of A. Defn by properties: 1: det I = 1. 2: If 2 rows are equal, det(A) = 0. 3: det \(A\) depends linearly on first row.
Properties So, there is sign change in Det(A) with row exchanges. Also, Det(A) is unchanged with \(row_{1} += k row_{2}\).</description>

Adversarial nature and randomization The mistake bounded model is adversarial in nature - we are concerned with the number of mistakes made in the worst case. So, randomization helps : the adversary decides on the input before the coin is tossed, so not knowing the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s output, its attempts to cause mistakes are less successful.</description>

      <description>Model/ hypothesize for predictive ability Many natural phenomena are not deterministic. We often want concise explanations for observed phenomena. This will grant us great predictive ability. Probability theory aims to model and understand uncertainties such phenomena.
Realism vs conciseness The more the model reflects reality, the better it is. Yet, as we want to avoid overfitting to limited data, we seek conciseness.
So, the art here is to define more and more general/ concise models, which also manage to model reality closely, whose parameters turn out to be easy to learn in practice.</description>

 There are 2 types of individual who trade freedom for money.
1 The employed (millions of these). They spend all their weekdays working for money. They earn money so they can pay bills and feel free at the weekend
2 The individual who is never satisfied - they want more money. The business owner/megarich, entrepreneur, wanker, etc. They are boring show-offs and even more boring company; they only talk about making money.</description>

Sums, products, quotients (sans 0 denominator) of convergent sequences are convergent.
Boundedness Upper and lower bounds.
Montonicity Monotone increasing and decreasing sequences.
A monotone increasing sequence that is bounded above must converge: imagine points on real line; similarly monotone decreasing sequence that is bounded below.
(Bolzano, Weierstrass): Every bounded sequence has a subsequence which converges: let M be the bound; either [-M, 0] or [0, M] has \(\infty\) elements; so use this repeatedly to find monotone, bounded subsequence; this converges.</description>

Neutrophil blood levels increase naturally in response to infections, injuries, and other types of stress. They may decrease in response to severe or chronic infections, drug treatments, and genetic conditions. +++(Note Diagnostic use)+++ 55–70 percent of all white blood cells in the bloodstream Made in bone marrow.</description>

Minimum cut objectives Maybe find \(argmin_{(V_{i})} cut((V_{i}))\): but \(V_{1} = V\) minimizes it. So, to balance the partitions, associate each vertex with a weight w(v), get W = diag(w(v)); define \(w(V_{i}) = \sum_{v \in V_{i}} w(v)\); minimize \(Q((V_{i})) = \sum \frac{cut(V_{i})}{w(V_{i})}\).
Ratio, normalized cuts If \(w(v) = 1\), get ratio cut objective fn. So, ratio cut is trying to minimize the weight of cross-cut edges, averaged over the nodes.</description>

      <description>Object oriented design is considered in the software architecture survey.
Object manipulation The main idea of object oriented programming is to describe computation in terms of manipulating states of objects. This causes state changes to be local - which helps programmers design a well structured view of state and behavior.
This is distinct from the functional programming paradigm.
Encapsulation and locality Hiding data and methods from outside methods restricts state changes to be local.</description>

      <description>Best choice: organic cold pressed oils. For deep frying - go for sesame oil (traditional hindu choice) or coconut oil.
Production Cold pressed Cold pressed oils are obtained by physical pressing of the seeds, fruits &amp;amp; nuts and forcing the oil out. This is the same as the traditional process to extract oils.
Refined oils Refined oils are the oils that are extracted through the use of solvents and through bleaching and deodorizing processes.</description>

      <description>Vegetarian sources of omega 3 fats: flaxseeds and flaxseed oil, walnuts, hemp seeds, leafy green vegetables. Unfortunately, however, most naturally occurring vegetarian sources of omega 3 fatty acids are not very rich in DHA (a very important type of omega 3 fat). How much DHA is recommended per day? 100-300mg/day [Ref]</description>

      <description>Theme Ontology is concerned with entities: their classification and relationship. Every entity has certain properties.
Motivation The main benefit of ontology is that one can reason about an entity using general statements about the corresponding entity type.
Ontologies are very useful, for example, in the case of understanding speech - where many different words (eg: man, indian .. ) are used to hint at the same entity.
Entity-types Entities having several properties in common can be viewed as being instances of a single entity-type.</description>

      <description>Distinctive features of the language Purpose of design Inspired by functional programming languages.
Distributed computing: There&amp;rsquo;ll be many services on the internet, need a language to orchestrate them. So, good internet mashup language.
Good for concisely reasoning about distrubted systems.
Sites Everything is a site: a possibly remote function without side-effect which may not respond. Even +, -, if(..) etc.. are sites. These may return sites too. Actual site call is not executed until all arguments are available.</description>

      <description>Here we consider basic (possibly multi-step) actions involving various negotiable instruments in the market.
Buying and selling Basic actions in a stock market are to buy or sell a security. The securities exchange has programs/ machines which effectively communicate the price of various stocks based on what prices people are asking/ willing to pay for them - by recording these bids.
Market price order A market order is an order to buy or sell a stock at the current market price.</description>

Minimum element \(\forall y \in S: x\leq y\).
Partial order Aka Posets: Partially Ordered sets. Maybe some \((x, y) \in S\) not comparable. Eg: vectors, componentwise \(&amp;lt;\). Visualize with Hasse diagrams.
Minimal element \(\forall y \in S: x\leq y \implies x = y\). Note difference from minimum. Eg: in triangle joining (1,1), (0, 1), (1, 0): line joining the last 2 pts are minimal elements.</description>

      <description>Source of water  &amp;ldquo;Recently, enstatites have been in the news because a recent study has shown that they contain sufficient Hydrogen with a specific isotopic signature to have contributed to the emergence of a major fraction of the water on the Earth. This strengthens a big role for the enstatite bodies in the origin of the Earth and its water. &amp;hellip; The authors of the said recent study admit this fact and propose that carbonaceous chondrites of the Ivuna-type could have supplied additional water after the initial formation of the Earth to result in its current isotopic signature.</description>

Owners usually get a portion of profit as ’dividends’. They have a say in appointing the highest level/ board of executives/ managers who run the company on their behalf.
Shares/ Equity Public offerings Existing owners or executives can effectively divide the company’s ownership into a certain number of shares.</description>

      <description>Chapter Scope A signle programming language can support multiple paradigms. Programming language features enabling different programming paradigms and architectures are considered elsewhere. Eg: Higher order functions underlies functional programming paradigm.
Imperative vs declarative programming Imperative programming Views computation in terms of altering state.
Structured programming In this programming paradigm, state changes are restricted locally. This helps organize code and state information. Structured programming code is more easily understood and maintainable than common procedural language code.</description>

Sometimes, a tradeoff may be involved: tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency of a language. One may even use different programming languages to specify different parts of the logic to the computer.
Expressiveness/ conciseness Expressiveness is important in rapid prototyping/ programming. The presence of useful libraries is a major factor which affects conciseness.</description>

Eg: An navigation agent that wants to know the user&amp;rsquo;s destination may have to decide between asking for a nearby landmark, or for the street name or for a clarification of prior utterence.
Rule based vs utility computation So, the agent needs some way of prioritizing various sub-objectives/ actions. It may do this using some rigid rules.</description>

Reader notes So much of this paper rang true even regarding my own experience as a grad student in USA 2007-10. Suhas mentions: &amp;ldquo;(This) has had a great influence on me, and several others (like Vishvas) that I have shared it with. Thank you for giving me the right perspective towards science at an early stage in my scientific training.</description>

      <description>Be wary of taste: Stomach over brain over tongue Taste was evolved to identify nutrient rich food; but in the modern world, the tongue is easily fooled by cleverly mixed chemicals. In this high calorie environment, it is not wise to trust whims of the tongue.
But, that said, the autonomous ganglion in stomach needs to be satisfied.
Vegetarianism In accordance with culture and current knowledge of healthy nutrition, stay ovo-lacto vegetarian.</description>

      <description>Overview It is very important to critique a paper or a talk, understand its shortcomings, suggest future improvements. Thence, incremental research occurs.
General loop: Find area. Find problem in a given area. Find solution strategy for a given problem. Implement solution, evaluate, communicate.
Popular research mode: Knowing and heavily using old techniques: take a few hammers, hit everything with it. Finding new techniques is rare and hard.
OFTEN, perturb the problem and extrapolate a solution.</description>

      <description>Components Every processor consists of an arithmetic and logic unit/ circuit (ALU), a few memory registers with a few layers of cache, memory and graphics controller circuits in order to be able to perform I/O operations and using extended working memory.
Tight knit Parallelism Multiple cores Usually multiple cores share memory.
Pipelines Aka instruction level parallelism.
Processing often has pipeline structure; eg: fetch instruction, fetch data, execute instruction, store data. There are usually separate functional units within a single processor which take care of these separate tasks in each clock cycle.</description>

      <description>Maintenance Fan vent cleaning In case of a laptop, the fan-vent needs to be cleaned periodically. CPU temperature can be monitored in the GUI using common applications.
Battery If laptop is always connected, best to disconnect battery \chk.
Vostro 1000 disassembly procedure Remove panel above keyboard. Disconnect keyboard, wires to monitor, trackpad. Remove screws in the front and in the back. Remove the panel from above the keyboard.
Upgrades Understand needs In order to understand what needs to be change, it is good to understand resource limitations: is working memory low, or is the CPU too slow.</description>

      <description>Workshops: Some explicitly deny that a presentation in a workshop does not count as a publication. So such stuff is publishable elsewhere. Other workshops are contrary.
Publish long versions of conference papers in journals.
1 top tier paper = many 2nd tier papers. It is far more important to publish regularly in a top tier conference than to publish profusely in a 2nd tier conference. Read papers from those conference and aim for such work.</description>

Never aim to say ’I am full’ after eating; instead aim to say: ’I won’t be hungry for 4 hours.’. Do not eat to relieve boredom or to take a break. Let it not be the dominant source of Ananda - use buddhi instead to gain Ananda from dhArmika-kAryas!
Example: Okinawans stop eating before they are 80% full: they say this to themselves before eating.</description>

      <description>Common assumptions A channel eventually (maybe at \(t=\infty\)) delivers all packets without corruption or dropping, in the correct order.
Processes can run at arbitrary, non 0 speed.
Don&amp;rsquo;t care about efficiency, focus on safety and progress.
Assume you have infinite buffers.
Synchronized communication Sometimes, this is needed. Max time to deliver a message is some t.
Proving algorithm efficacy Axiomatize the system, and use pure logic.
Usually 2 stages: safety property: you won&amp;rsquo;t fall into a wrong state; and progress property.</description>

Correctness Assertion Assertion p: Assume that p is true.
In practice, good programmers use special statements to check if assertions are true; eg: Java.
Correctness S is correct wrt precondition p and postcondition q if: starting with p true, run S, get q.
Partial correctness \(\set{p}S\set{q}\). S is correct wrt p and q if: starting with p true, if ye run S, ye get q if S terminates.</description>

      <description>General problem Many (x, y) pairs (observations), h(x, w) form (eg: degree of polynomial) known, parameters \(w\) in h(x, w) is unknown. Want to find \(w\). range(h) is not finite, it is usually continuous.
y is the response variable, \(w\) is called the regression vector. The matrix formed by \(x\) is often called the design matrix.
Many such continuous valued models are described in probabilistic models reference.
Linear regression The problem h(x, w) is linear in \(w\) (Eg: \(w_1 x^{3}+ w_2 \)x\( + w_3=0\): \(\ftr_{i}(x) = x^{i}\)).</description>

      <description>Here, rather than considering reproduction of cells in the body of a multicellular animal, we are concerned with production of entire new generations of organisms.
Sexual vs asexual Reproduction can be sexual or asexual. Some organisms are capable of both - they are aka hermaphrodites.
Sexual reproduction Combination of genes Sexual reproduction involves combination of genetic material from multiple (usually 2) organisms to produce genetic material for the next generation. Usually these parent organisms are of the same species.</description>

      <description>Risk and return-advantage types Risk in the investment is the potential to loose money. Risk is paired with advantage: investors promised a bigger return will tolerate some risk.
Credit default risk This risk is particularly relevant for bonds. This is the risk of businesses not repaying their loans.
The advantage is that riskier bonds yield bigger returns.
Credit rating agencies Sometimes, the ultimate owners of bonds sometimes do not have a clear idea about the risk involved.</description>

Loss functions: labeling single data points Different measures of goodness/ error functions are appropriate for different scenarios.
Loss functions: vector labels Loss functions in this case are often defined to penalize deviation from the actual label symmetrically.
See loss functions in regression section.
Loss functions for classification Below we mainly consider the loss functions \(l(\hat{y}, y)\) which are without regularization to account for prior belief.</description>

      <description>To facilitate and encourage saving for large expenses in the future, governments often provide tax breaks for special investment accounts for retirement, medical expenses and children’s education (college funds).
See here.
Taxation-deferred funds Incomes earned using these special accounts are exempt from taxes while they stay within the fund. However, withdrawals, which are only under very restricted circumstances, are taxed.
Eg: Individual Retirement Account [IRA] in USA.
Profit-tax free funds Money may be taxed at the time it is deposited in the fund, while withdrawals are tax-free.</description>

Concentration of activity in industry and agriculture (even coffee shops!) is justified by economic theory on the grounds of economies of scale (aka &amp;ldquo;marginal cost of production&amp;rdquo;).  Limitations  Via S Vembu. The costs drop rapidly with scale at first but beyond a certain scale (let&amp;rsquo;s call it &amp;ldquo;optimal scale&amp;rdquo;), stop dropping or even start increasing as dis-economies of scale kick in.</description>

      <description>Basic operations include listing elements, checking set-membership, finding unions and intersections.
Set implementations include the ListSet and the BitSet.
Bit-set BitSet uses a sequence of bits - one for each element. Theoretically, it can store arbitrary elements which may be mapped to integers, but is often used to store integers. Its size is equal to the largest number N stored in the set, though it may store k elements; so, from this perspective, using it in preference to ListSet makes sense when the set is dense.</description>

Importance This notion is useful because it enumerates the sets whose size we want to measure.
Product space You can take two measurable spaces \((S_1, F_1), (S_2, F_2)\), and, by set product get a bigger measurable space \((S_1 \times S2, F_1 \times F_2)\).</description>

      <description>Aka formula.
Language Syntax All sentences are written with symbols/ words drawn from some alphabet, in a formal language. A statement/ formula is said to be well formed if it makes sense according to some formal grammar.
Values The most basic statements are the values T / TRUE and F/ FALSE.
Semantics Corresponding to languages of various levels of expressiveness, there are Logics/ calculii which specify the semantics. They, for example, specify what &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;, \(\lnot P\) etc.</description>

Plastics  According to The Green Guide, a website and magazine devoted to greener living and owned by the National Geographic Society, the safest plastics for repeated use in storing food are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE, or plastic #2), low-density polyethylene (LDPE, or plastic #4) and polypropylene (PP, or plastic #5). [Ref] Some of its food storage containers use polycarbonate (plastic #7), which has been shown to leach the harmful hormone-disrupting chemical Bisphenol A (BPA) into food items after repeated uses.</description>

      <description>Structure Unrefined fats include double bonds in the carbon chain, which lead to a molecular structure which is not a straight chain. Upon hydrogenation, single bonds are formed in place of double bonds, with a strong preference for the formation of trans-hydrocarbon backbone rather than cis-bonds. Such molecules have a more linear structure.
Hydrogenated oil Most trans fats consumed today, however, are industrially created as a side effect of partial hydrogenation of plant oils.</description>

      <description>Overview  &amp;ldquo;We know that at least 44% of all infections&amp;ndash;and the majority of community-acquired transmissions&amp;ndash;occur from people without any symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Some experts estimate that as few as 1000 SARS-CoV2 infectious viral particles are all that will be needed.&amp;rdquo; - EB    corona-growth-visualization   Virus expulsion mechanics  &amp;ldquo;A single breath releases 50 - 5000 droplets.</description>

      <description>Based on similarity and dissimilarity of genomes, one can organize various species / classes of organisms into a tree.
Species of cellular life The top branches (superregna) are: archaea, bacteria and eukaryota (true nucleus). The prior two are called prokaryota (primitive - neucleus).
The top branches of Eukaryota (regna) include plants, animals, fungi and protista (amoeba and some other primitive classes of organisms).
A notable branch of animals include the phylum chordata - subphylum vertebrata.</description>

      <description>Intro  Unschooling is an educational method and philosophy that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning. &amp;ldquo;Unschooling is education whereby the learner determines what he learns (content, pace, depth), when he learns it (any age, or not at all), where his learns (home, community, online or school) and how he learns (self-taught, teacher-taught, facilitated, classroom, apprenticeship, online, correspondence, book, video, game, experiential, lecture, volunteering, project, job, or travel).</description>

      <description>General economy USA has high trade deficit: especially with oil producing countries and manufacturers like China.
GDP Growth is much lower than in emerging economies: 0-3%.
Industry USA’s industry is highly innovative - one of the best in the world. Industries are highly mechanized.
Manufacturing America is the biggest manufacturer of goods in the world. But, much of the manufacturing is done in highly automated factories which are run by a handful of skilled employees overseeing the automation; manufacturing involving low skilled labour has moved to countries (in the developing world) with cheaper labor.</description>

      <description>Principle You inject antigens into the body. Then antibodies are generated, which last for a certain duration. Booster doses might increase the duration.
Efficacy  Vaccine efficacy - % reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions Vaccine effectiveness - ability of vaccine to prevent outcomes of interest in the “real world” For some vaccines, booster dose increases efficacy.    vaccine efficacy   Policy Factors  Cost of disease vs cost of vaccination (including adverse effects)  </description>

      <description>Effectiveness expectations  There are different strains - so vaccination may not be totally effective (just as in case of reinfection). Flare-up possibility: The antibodies the vaccine elicits will have virus neutralizing capabilities and that is what needed. But there are other non neutralizing antibodies that gets produced that can flare up the disease. Called ADE (antibody dependent enhancement) has been observed in Dengue and other viral infections.  Effectiveness duration  T cell response following even mild and asymptomatic infection can last upto 6 months.</description>

      <description>Beliefs and market positions Agents, in trading securities, bet on change in market’s evaluation of securities. Thus, the market price of securities is adjusted continually.
If agents believe that a security will increase in value, they are said to act from a bullish/ long position. If the reverse is true, they are said to act from a bearish/ short position.
Agents may also believe a certain company will outperform or underperform other companies in the sector.</description>

Request/ response format They specify the serialization formats in which input/ request and output/ response objects (structured data) are to be encoded. This is usually in JSON or XML format.
XML, being more verbose, results in slower computation and transmission.
Underlying Protocol Usually, they use http or rpc protocol.
Web interface Protocols Simple Object access protocol (SOAP) It specifies the use of XML for representing objects, certain Message Exchange Patterns (MEP).</description>

Preparing the boat While sailing, the fin under the center board should be down in the water. The aft fin/ skeg is always down.
Mechanics The sail and the fin operate on the same principle as an airplane wing. Critical forces are lift and drag. The lift generated by the sail is at an angle to the orientation of the board defined by the relative orientation of the sail.</description>

The latter may be powered by UPS systems (inverters backed by DC battery) - by putting them downstream from UPS output.   Fuses or trip switches at switch boards and even at the plug point. 2 way switches for staircase lights, bedroom lights and fans. Good placement anticipating appliances like AC, fan, lights. Power generated in the household (solar, wind&amp;hellip;) may need to be consumed preferentially - or dumped to the grid.</description>

Collaborative filtering Latent factor approach Assume small number of latent random variables, which combine together to form various view points and data points, cause the labels.
Low rank factorization Let values of latent RV behind data pt j be \(v_{j}\), behind viewpoint i be \(u_{i}\); then get \(Y_{i,j} = u_{i}^{T}v_{j}\).</description>

Binary classification See the many hypothesis classes/ parametrized model families in the colt ref, boolean functions ref.
Non parametric methods k nearest neighbors A discriminative, non parametric approach. Number of examples: N. Samples: \(S = (x_{1}, .. x_{N})\). There are \(k\) classes. To classify \(x\), find \(k\) nearest neighbors in S; take their majority vote.
So, can&amp;rsquo;t ever throw away data points.
Linear models for discrete classification Linear separability of data sets or feature space: Decision surfaces are (p-1) dim hyperplanes in feature space.</description>

      <description>Trajectory prediction Problem Consider sequential data: observations \(S\) consisting of labels \(L_1 .. L_n\) observed at different positions \(X_1.. X_n\) (perhaps times). We want to predict \(L_{n+1}\) corresponding to \(X_{n+1}\).
The underlying process is such that the distribution of \(L_{n+1}\) depends on both \(S\) and \(X_{n+1}\).
Simplifications Even predicting a lower bound or upper bound (whp) of \(L_{n+1}\) may be useful.

      <description>Cubes with 1 side open  If the combustion area is large enough and not cramped, equivalent to burning wood out in the open. Or in principle equivalent to a &amp;ldquo;Cube with 2 sides open&amp;rdquo; type stove with pot on top. Example: traditional homa-kUNDa-s (Idealized).  Characteristics  Consumes quite a bit of wood. Lot of smoke when the fire is low, and in the initial and terminal stages. Ash accumulation + charcoal creation observed.</description>

      <description>Memory hierarchy Memory access could be 100 times slower than flops: this is an important consideration when optimizing algorithms. Hence, there is a hierarchy of memory:
Registers in the processor \(&amp;gt;\) On chip Cache: many layers \(&amp;gt;\) main memory \(&amp;gt;\) secondary memory located on the hard-disk for example.
Glossary SDRAM  Working memory is capable of random, rather than serial, access. Also, it is dynamic - it retains data only when supplied electricity to periodically refresh its memory.</description>

      <description>Objectives To publicize an important discovery, and submit it for criticism and improvement.
Let it be Explanatory Telling a story Write as if you are writing a story. The abstract and the conclusion should contain mostly the same text, except one may say ’we will show’, and the other should say ’we have shown’.
Don’t try to sound impressive Academics have the bad habit of using jargon and stilted prose. Explanatory writing sounds less impressive, and is longer.</description>

      <description>Target/ ध्येयम्  Stay at the lighter end of your body&amp;rsquo;s frame  Over-muscled, fueled by constantly eating, is not healthy    Physical Standards Via Guru Anaerobic:
 1 Deadlift: One-rep max of 2 x body weight (general strength) 2 Chin-ups: 20 (usable upper body strength) 3 100m sprint: Under 13 seconds (speed) 4 One mile: Under 6 minutes (endurance) 5 Body-fat: 10-12% - a six-pack is just visible (health)  These are not elite standards, but achieving all five would likely take you into the top 1% of the population.</description>
