If context was lacking, I would easily take it for a terrestrial scene of a dried-up river from a desertified land with haze from a sandstorm. It also seems like it was indeed once dotted with early life, much like Earth, which has now probably become extinct over all or much of the planet. Like the pArIkShita-s of hastinApura who once went extinct. It raises a philosophical question of whether there is anything to life at all if its ultimate destination is such extinction. Or are we ourselves descendants of life once shared by Mars and Earth&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
