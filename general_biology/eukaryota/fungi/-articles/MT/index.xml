      <description>&lt;p&gt;It appears that cold blooded animals are way more susceptible to fungal infections.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Warm blooded animals like mammals and dinosaurs are less so.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;One of the selective advantages that might have led to the fixation of warm bloodedness&lt;br&gt;&#xA;is probably a high degree of natural resistance to systemic mycosis.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;My own investigations suggest that cold-blooded animals&lt;br&gt;&#xA;might have a special defense against such fungal pathogens&lt;br&gt;&#xA;that we have lost as endothermy takes care.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Thus, we see frogs being decimated by systemic fungal infection&lt;br&gt;&#xA;but rare to see mammalian (except probably bats) or bird species being similar attacked. &amp;hellip;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So there has to be&#xA;a special condition for systemic mycosis &amp;amp; probably the diabetes prevalence in desh is the big factor in this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
