It appears that cold blooded animals are way more susceptible to fungal infections.  
Warm blooded animals like mammals and dinosaurs are less so.  
One of the selective advantages that might have led to the fixation of warm bloodedness  
is probably a high degree of natural resistance to systemic mycosis.   
My own investigations suggest that cold-blooded animals  
might have a special defense against such fungal pathogens  
that we have lost as endothermy takes care.  
Thus, we see frogs being decimated by systemic fungal infection  
but rare to see mammalian (except probably bats) or bird species being similar attacked. ...  
So there has to be 
a special condition for systemic mycosis & probably the diabetes prevalence in desh is the big factor in this.
