## Mucor
Mucors are more basal fungi (i.e. outside of the "crown fungi" composed of ascomycetes, e.g. the alcohol yeast & basidiomycetes, e.g. mushrooms).  
They are commonly seen as molds on decaying food and their spores are abundant in any place with a little decay, especially in desh.  
We inhale their spores all the time but normal humans are quite resistant to it.
