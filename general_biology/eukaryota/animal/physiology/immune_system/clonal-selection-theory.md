What is the Clonal Selection Theory?  
The clonal selection theory is a foundational concept in immunology that explains how the immune system generates a diverse range of antibodies to fight specific invaders (antigens) like viruses or bacteria. It was proposed by Australian immunologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet in 1957, building on earlier ideas by Niels Jerne and David Talmage, and was later supported by experimental evidence from Gustav Nossal and Joshua Lederberg in 1958.

## How It Works: The Core Idea  
Imagine your immune system as a library of specialized workers (lymphocytes, specifically B cells and T cells). Each worker is pre-programmed to recognize one specific "book" (antigen) out of millions of possible invaders. Here's the process in simple steps:

**Diversity Exists Before Infection**: Before you're exposed to any germ, your body already has millions of different lymphocytes, each with a unique receptor on its surface. These receptors are like locks, each designed to fit a specific key (antigen).

**Antigen Triggers Selection**: When a foreign antigen (e.g., from a virus) enters your body, it binds to the lymphocyte whose receptor matches it. This is the "selection" part—only the right cell is chosen.

**Clonal Expansion**: Once selected, that lymphocyte starts dividing rapidly, creating a "clone" of identical cells. Some of these clones become antibody-producing factories, releasing antibodies to neutralize the antigen. Others become memory cells, sticking around to respond faster if the same antigen returns.

**Self-Tolerance**: The theory also explains how the immune system avoids attacking your own body. During development, lymphocytes that react to "self" antigens are eliminated or suppressed, preventing autoimmune diseases.

## Key Evidence
In 1958, Nossal and Lederberg showed that a single B cell produces only one type of antibody, confirming the theory's prediction of specificity.

This built on Burnet’s hypothesis that the immune system's diversity is pre-existing, not created on the spot by the antigen (as older "instructive" theories suggested).
