      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/07/15/wasps-by-the-iron-fort/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the early 90s we decided to scale to the great cliff of Lohagad where the founder of the Maharatta nation had hidden his loot after his ferocious raid on Surat. The fort had remained largely impregnable till 1818 when the Britons of cursed memory took it by bombing it from the adjacent citadel of Visapur. The old fortications on the Lohagad spur appear to have been built by the Andhras with subsequent embellishements by the Maharattas forming the most prominent part. At its foot we saw a derilict Shiva temple that had been devasted by the Moslem hordes during the great 26 year Jihad in the Deccan. The settings were at their verdant best on the day close to the solistice when we visited the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
