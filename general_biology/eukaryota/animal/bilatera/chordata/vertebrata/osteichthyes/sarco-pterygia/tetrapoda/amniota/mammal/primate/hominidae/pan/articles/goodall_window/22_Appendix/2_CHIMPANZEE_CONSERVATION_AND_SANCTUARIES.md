THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN WORLD, and in many Third World countries, attitudes towards animals and the environment are changing. There is more awareness of the plight of chimpanzees than there was a few years ago, and with it a growing concern and desire to help. In answer to special needs, individuals emerge when they are most wanted.

Deeply involved in trying to instigate and assist conservation strategies in Africa is the Committee for Conservation and Care of Chimpanzees—“The Four C’s.” This is a body of scientists, all of whom are concerned with chimpanzee conservation and welfare. Its chairman is Dr. Geza Teleki, who is working with Dr. Toshisada Nishida and others to put together an action plan designed to help as quickly as possible the beleaguered chimpanzees across the African continent. The map on the next page shows the places where chimpanzees are still found, and the research projects, some of which \(such as those at Gombe and Mahale Mountains in Tanzania, Tai Forest in Ivory Coast, and Lope in the Gabon\) have been in progress for a good many years. In all cases these projects are highly beneficial to chimpanzee conservation in the immediate vicinity.

Surveys are needed desperately in many countries, to find out more about the actual range of chimpanzees today. And, in certain key areas, it is important to set up research projects as quickly as possible. Without such projects, carried out in conjunction with conservation education, tourism and agro-forestry, chimpanzees will disappear rapidly from a number of other countries. Of course, the studies will be important in their own right, too. They will enable us to learn more about one of the most fascinating aspects of chimpanzee behaviour—that about which we know least—behavioural differences between populations in different parts of Africa. As it is, not only are hundreds of individual chimpanzees perishing but, in addition, whole cultures are vanishing before we have had time to study them.

During 1989 I became involved in chimpanzee conservation and protection in Burundi, one hundred miles or so north of Gombe along Lake Tanganyika. This was a direct result of the conservation interests of Ambassador James D. Phillips \(Dan\) and his wife, Lucie. I first visited Burundi at their invitation, met with President Buyoya and a number of his ministers and other members of government, including the Secretary General, Venant Bambonehoyo, and was sincerely impressed by the efforts being made by this regime to save the remaining forested areas of their beautiful country. I was impressed, too, by the steps towards chimpanzee conservation that had already been taken. I met with Peter Trenchard, coordinator of the Biological Diversity Project, who had spent several months observing the chimpanzees of the Kibira National Park, a lovely mountain rain forest in the north of the country. I was taken by Paul Cowles and Wendy Bromley to visit a small group of chimpanzees in the south of the country. There a number of local people had been employed as “Chimp Guards” to monitor the movements of the chimpanzees as they travel from one strip of gallery forest to another, crossing cultivated areas and bypassing native villages. The close juxtaposition of chimpanzees and villagers is not unusual; the steps being taken to preserve the chimpanzees—initially set up by a conservationist of great foresight, Robert Clausen—I found unique. But the situation was potentially explosive since the farmers living nearby need land badly. Paul \(who had worked first as a Peace Corps Volunteer and was then the Catholic Relief Services technical consultant to the National Institute for the Environment and Nature Conservation \(INECN\)\) explained the agro-forestry project with which he was involved. First nurseries are developed for fast-growing tree species. The seedlings are then planted around villages. Many of the trees can be used within two years—for building poles, charcoal, firewood, as shade trees, and for enriching the soil with nitrogen. Each tree species has its own special function. The application of this project for the protection of the remaining indigenous forested areas is obvious. Wendy was working with Paul, explaining this new concept to the villagers. Burundi is to be congratulated on this programme, without which it might be impossible to conserve wild chimpanzees in this very small country that has such a high human population density.

In order to provide additional income and incentive to local people, it is clearly necessary to develop controlled tourism. As a first step, Charlotte Uhlenbroek, funded by the Jane Goodall Institute \(UK\), began to habituate a group of chimpanzees in the south of the country to the presence of humans. As an integral part of this programme \(which is, of course, aimed at collecting as much data on the behaviour of the chimpanzees as possible\) a number of the Chimp Guards have already visited Gombe for training in observational methods by the Tanzanian field staff.

A new awareness and interest in chimpanzees in the country brought to light the fact that there were a number of pet chimpanzees in the capital, Bujumbura, and in other places throughout the country. Most of these youngsters have almost certainly been smuggled across the border from neighbouring Zaire. Thanks to the support of the government and the help of many individuals, JGI \(UK\), in close cooperation with INECN, is now able to go ahead with the building of a sanctuary near Bujumbura where ex-pets, and any confiscated youngsters, can be released. This sanctuary has been planned, a site has been allocated and, with the help of Steve Matthews, the initial construction will commence during 1990. The first two orphans, Poco and Socrates, are in a temporary cage in the garden of Melinda \(Mimi\) Brian. An education centre, where local people and visitors can learn about chimpanzees and their behaviour, will be an important and central part of the sanctuary.

In the same year Karen Pack set out for Pointe Noire in Congo-Brazzaville to try to set up a sanctuary for ex-pet chimpanzees and those confiscated from hunters by the government. Karen is currently working for JGI \(UK\) at the zoo in Pointe Noire to enrich the environment of eight chimpanzees there. These eight will, it is hoped, join a number of ex-pets and confiscated youngsters in a sanctuary to be constructed by JGI. An education centre is planned, along the same lines as the one in Burundi. This will be with the full support and approval of the Congolese government. Once again, Steve Matthews will mastermind the construction, with the generous support of Conoco Inc.—an oil company that is showing genuine care for the environment. We are especially grateful to Roger Simpson. Until the sanctuary is built, Madame Jamart is caring for the young chimpanzees confiscated by the government. She and her husband are remarkable.

These will certainly not be the first sanctuaries for abused or unwanted chimpanzees. The first in Africa was begun in the late 1960s by Eddie Brewer. As a government official in charge of wildlife, Eddie confiscated young chimpanzees being smuggled through the Gambia \(where, by then, chimpanzees had become extinct\). His daughter, Stella, subsequently moved the chimps to Senegal, where every effort was made to reintroduce them into a natural habitat. Unfortunately, the wild chimpanzees objected to the intrusion into their territory, and it was necessary to remove the ex-captives and relocate them on Baboon Island on the Gambia River. For many years now this project has been carried on by an extraordinarily dedicated individual, Janice Carter.

A truly remarkable British couple living in Zambia, Sheila and David Siddle, have turned their home into a refuge for confiscated youngsters. Chimpanzees are not endemic to Zambia, and most of the orphans were confiscated after being smuggled out of Zaire. The Siddles have constructed a remarkable eight-acre enclosure and have an ambitious plan to fence in a huge area of bushland where, eventually, the whole group can roam in relative freedom. In almost every country in Africa where chimpanzees still live there is this problem of orphans. The Jane Goodall Institute itself operates five sanctuaries for orphaned chimpanzees in Kenya, Congo-Brazzaville, Tanzania, and two in Uganda.

In Chapter 19 I introduced those champions of abused chimpanzees, Simon and Peggy Templar. Some of their confiscated youngsters went out to the Gambia, but more recently the battered orphans from the Spanish beach racket have been finding refuge at Monkey World in Dorset, England. This sanctuary was created through the combined efforts of Jim Cronin, Steve Matthews and veterinarian Ken Park. Some of these youngsters were in pitiful shape when they arrived, but they were nurtured, played with, disciplined and loved by Jeremy Keeling, a truly caring person whose exceptional rapport with chimpanzees has done much to heal their mental scars.

In summary, the plight of chimpanzees worldwide is grim. In Africa there is desperate need for funding—for surveys, for studies and for sanctuaries—and a need too for qualified and dedicated people to conduct the surveys and studies. There is a growing need for sanctuaries outside Africa too, as illegal shipments of chimpanzees are confiscated in various countries, as individuals are rescued from the entertainment and pet trade, and as others are retired from laboratory research. Yet somehow I feel sure that wonderful and dedicated people like those who have already contributed so much and provided so many homeless chimpanzees with sanctuary—and love—will appear. Humans, through ignorance and greed, have brought hundreds of chimpanzees to this pitiful state; humans, through concern and compassion, must do what they can to address the wrong.
