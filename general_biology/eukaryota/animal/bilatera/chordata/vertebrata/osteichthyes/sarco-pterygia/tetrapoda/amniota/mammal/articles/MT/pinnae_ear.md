While all vertebrates have ears, the outer ears -- pinnae -- are new structures that emerged only in mammals. Where did they come from? Invented from nothing or from atavistic repurposing of some other structure? Recent work suggests that the external ears are repurposed gills of the aquatic ancestors of vertebrates. Further vertebrate gills share a common ancestry with invertebrate gills suggesting that the ancestral bilateral animal had a respiratory structure from which extant respiratory structures and the ear pinnae emerged.

This explains rare human mutants like a woman who supposedly grew ears on her neck.
