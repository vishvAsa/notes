We know hardly anything about the early dinosaurs: depending on how one interprets footprints from what is today Poland, they were possibly present as early as 250 million years ago and almost certainly by 246 MYA. Yet, barring the fragmentary Nyasasaurus (just a right humerus and a few vertebrae), skeletal remains appear only ~230 MYA. So the first 15-20 million years of Dinosaur history is a blackhole.
