JANE GOODALL’S WORK—begun at Gombe fifty years ago—has influenced and inspired hundreds of people and still touches the lives of millions as she continues to give lectures and attend conferences worldwide.

Jane and the Gombe research inspired generations of scientists, many of them women, to work in science and conservation and at universities around the globe.

A huge body of work from Jane and other scientists and field staff has come out of Gombe. The estimated numbers of publications, papers, and films inspired by this work are impressive:

  


+ 200 scientific papers
+ 41 Ph.D. theses relating to chimpanzees, baboons, monkeys, and ecology \(of these students nineteen were women\)
+ 16 major films by renowned companies, such as Discovery/ Animal Planet, National Geographic, BBC, HBO, and PBS; a large screen format film seen in 83 countries by over three million people; and a film for worldwide cinematic distribution launched for the fiftieth anniversary of Jane’s research at Gombe. Film teams from Japan, France, Germany, Austria, France, and Hungary have also made films about Jane and Gombe.
+ Hundreds of articles
+ 38 books, of which Jane Goodall published 14 \(not to mention the 8 children’s books she also authored\). Many of these books have been translated into foreign languages, including *In the Shadow of Man,* which has been translated into 52 languages.

  


*Contributors*

  


The following are some of the people who contributed to the collection of data and the administration at the Gombe Stream Research Centre. A full list of contributors will be made available on the Jane Goodall Institute website in 2010.

  


Four people stand out \(in addition to Jane Goodall\) for their very major contributions:

  

>
> HUGO VAN LAWICK, photographer and filmmaker, was able to document, for the first time, much of the behavior of the Gombe chimpanzees and baboons. It was his material, distributed through National Geographic documentaries and magazine articles, that validated Jane Goodall’s observations \(she had no university degree at the time\), and he played a major role in establishing the research station.
>
>   

>
> DEREK BRYCESON, as Director of National Parks, was able to help Jane maintain the research after the 1975 kidnapping incident made it impossible for several years for foreign students to work at Gombe.
>
>   

>
> ANNE PUSEY took on the task of computerizing all the data from 1960 to the present, working, with her students at Minnesota \(and now Duke\), to create a unique database of Gombe chimpanzee behavior.
>
>   

>
> ANTHONY COLLINS not only has conducted and directed baboon research at Gombe since 1972, but also has played an extraordinarily important role in maintaining good relations with the central and local government officers, linking field staff and visiting researchers, representing Gombe to the local community and throughout Tanzania, and maintaining continuity within the Research Centre.
