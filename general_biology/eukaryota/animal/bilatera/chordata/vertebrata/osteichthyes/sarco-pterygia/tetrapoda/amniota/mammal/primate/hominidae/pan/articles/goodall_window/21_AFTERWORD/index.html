  <meta property="og:description" content="OVER THE TWENTY YEARS following the publication of Through a Window, the total number of chimpanzees in Gombe has decreased. In the 1970s there were four communities. In the preceding pages we have seen how the males of the main study community, the Kasekela community, annihilated the Kahama community during the shocking Four Year War. The Kalande community, perhaps fifty strong, then moved northward, pushing the Kasekelan victors back on that front, while the equally strong Mitumba community pressed in from the north. Then, in 1987, there was a terrible epidemic of a flu-like disease that killed many chimpanzees in the Kasekela community and possibly the other two communities as well. By 1988, the Kasekela community had declined from about fifty to as few as thirty-eight.">

  <p>OVER THE TWENTY YEARS following the publication of <em>Through a Window,</em> the total number of chimpanzees in Gombe has decreased. In the 1970s there were four communities. In the preceding pages we have seen how the males of the main study community, the Kasekela community, annihilated the Kahama community during the shocking Four Year War. The Kalande community, perhaps fifty strong, then moved northward, pushing the Kasekelan victors back on that front, while the equally strong Mitumba community pressed in from the north. Then, in 1987, there was a terrible epidemic of a flu-like disease that killed many chimpanzees in the Kasekela community and possibly the other two communities as well. By 1988, the Kasekela community had declined from about fifty to as few as thirty-eight.</p>
<p>But the Kasekela community rebounded and gradually increased—t oday it numbers some sixty individuals, including eleven adult males, and has expanded its territory so that it now covers just over half the park. This expansion has been at the expense of the Mitumba and Kalande communities that were weakened not only by disease but by human farming activities, which had deprived the chimpanzees of key habitat outside the park. Also, evidence of some poaching surfaced in the south. Since 1993, Kasekela chimpanzees have not only acquired territory but also have attacked and mortally wounded at least five chimpanzees from the neighbouring communities.</p>
<p>The Mitumba community was down to twenty-one individuals by 1997. And, for some inexplicable reason, some of the remaining Mitumba males, on two separate occasions, ganged up and killed males of their own community. Nevertheless, despite this seemingly non-adaptive behaviour, the community, which now numbers twenty-five, may survive as there are several young males who will soon come of age and be able to help defend their territory. Indeed, the large Kasekela community has lost at least one of its adult females to attacks from Mitumba males.</p>
<p>We know less about the Kalande community, which we have monitored since 1999 but never fully habituated. We think there were well over thirty chimpanzees even in the late 1990s, but today the maximum number does not exceed sixteen, and there could be fewer. This decrease was a result of habitat loss, disease and intercommunity violence. And there was evidence that one individual was killed by humans.</p>
<p><em>Family Histories</em></p>
<p>In the space I have left, I want to give a quick update about the individual chimpanzees I introduced in the preceding pages of this book.</p>
<p>THE G FAMILY: Let me start with Goblin and the rest of Melissa’s children and grandchildren. Goblin lost his alpha position to Wilkie in 1989 during a fierce fight over a female, Candy. This left him with bad injuries to his scrotum. He kept well away from the other males during his convalescence (the story is told in the HBO film <em>Chimps: So Like Us)</em> but often groomed quietly with his sister, Gremlin. It was in keeping with his courageous, determined character that he made one attempt to regain his lost position—but it failed. He was again attacked, this time by many of the community—and once again he was driven into exile.</p>
<p>When Goblin finally rejoined the others, he played it safe, showing extreme submission to the high-ranking males. But while he never again tried to get to the top, he was very politically astute. When Freud became alpha, Goblin courted favor with him, gaining power from that friendship. When Frodo took over, Goblin transferred his attentions to him. He was even able to mate in their presence, usually after first “asking permission” by quickly glancing at, or briefly grooming or touching, his superior. But although he had much opportunity, it seems he sired no more offspring after his downfall. We think his injury must have left him sterile. Towards the end of his life Goblin looked old, his teeth worn to the gums. In August 2004, just before his fortieth birthday, he became sick. He showed up close to our research offices, possibly seeking help—for after his wounding we had taken him food and medicine. Mike Wilson, field director at Gombe at the time, writes, “We fed him, treated him with antibiotics, and several of us even spent the night in the forest with him, to ensure that he wasn’t attacked by leopards or bush pigs.” Mike describes how “he lay motionless in the bushes off the trail. It was terribly sad to see Goblin reduced to such a state. Despite our best efforts, he died.”</p>
<p>Goblin’s young brother Gimble, the survivor of Melissa’s twins, was always small. After Melissa died, he spent a lot of time travelling with Goblin. Despite his small size he developed an impressive display, and at one time, during the early days when Frodo became alpha, Gimble was clearly the second-ranking male. After this he gradually lost rank. He was last seen in 2007 when he was only thirty years old.</p>
<p>Goblin’s sister, Gremlin, after losing her firstborn, Getty (apparently killed for use in “witchcraft” or traditional medicine), had another son, Galahad, who was equally charismatic. We were devastated when she lost him also, during an epidemic of a flu-like disease in 2000.</p>
<p>After that her luck turned. Bill Wallauer actually filmed the birth of Gaia. And he filmed, too, the extraordinary and quite unexpected murderous attack on the newborn by Fifi, Gigi, and Fanni. It was then that I realized that the similar attacks by Passion and Pom were not incidences of aberrant behaviour after all. Fortunately, against all odds, Gremlin managed to keep Gaia safe.</p>
<p>Gaia was five years old when, during one of my rare visits to Gombe in 1998 (and during the making of the IMAX film <em>Jane Goodall’s Wild Chimpanzees</em>), Gremlin came into the feeding area with twin girls, Golden (Goldie) and Glitta. I was the first human to see them. It was an exciting moment—that turned to horror when Fanni, supported by Fifi, tried to seize the babies. Again Bill was able to film the shocking event—and again Gremlin somehow managed to protect her babies.</p>
<p>She was a marvelous mother to the twins, and Gaia was a great help, spending much time playing with, grooming, and carrying one or the other. Gaia preferred Glitta, while the more adventurous tomboy, Goldie, formed a really close bond with Galahad until his tragic death.</p>
<p>The twins have flourished. When Gremlin gave birth to her next child, Gimli, the twins took it in their stride. Perhaps because they were always together—or perhaps because their father was the tough Frodo—they showed early signs of independence. It will be fascinating to see how their relationship develops as they attain maturity. And it will be especially interesting to see what happens on their first consortships. If, as is likely, they continue to cycle in synchrony with each other, will each go off with a different male? Will one male try to take both? Or shall we see our first example of a double date! (There was an occasion when Satan’s ancient mother, Sprout, accompanied him on one of this consortships with a young female!)</p>
<p>Gaia had her first baby, Godot, in 2006. To our utter astonishment and dismay, Gremlin “stole” Godot very soon after his birth. He lived for five months but was always weak. Grem lin’s son Gimli was tolerant of the sudden intrusion of his infant nephew. He was two years old and possibly got more than his fair share of milk. A year later Gremlin took Gaia’s second baby—an autopsy showed it was stillborn and had never drawn breath.</p>
<p>Gaia soon became pregnant again and in 2008, to our delight, gave birth to twins. The gene for multiple births is, indeed, strong in this family! But our excitement turned to dismay when, for a third time, Gremlin intervened, snatching both babies away from her daughter. Neither survived, one dying at five days old and the other at thirteen days. It is hard to explain Gremlin’s behaviour. When she stole Godot I thought that perhaps, after looking after her twins for so long, she felt she needed a second infant to keep Gimli company. And Gaia was so used to Gremlin taking one or the other of the twins from her that she accepted the loss of her own baby in the same way.</p>
<p>Recently I was thrilled to receive news of the family from Gombe. “We are extremely happy to report that Gaia has given birth again and her infant is doing well,” wrote Anna Mosser, the field director. At 6 P.M. on June 5, 2009, Gaia and her newborn son joined a big group. At midday on the sixth Gremlin appeared for the first time. She showed some interest in her grandchild, but Gaia kept her distance from her mother and held the infant close. “We continued to follow the G-family (Gremlin, Gaia, and infants Golden, Glitta, and Gimli) for the next five days,” Anna wrote. During this time Gremlin continued to maintain possession. Her son is still alive at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Wilkie, as we have seen, took the alpha position from Goblin and reigned for three and a quarter years. He has always been a great groomer, and he has always been not only very highly motivated to mate with females but successful in his endeavours. DNA analysis shows that he has fathered at least six children, including Gaia.</p>
<p>THE F FAMILY: Fifi almost made it through the fifty years—she disappeared in 2004 along with two-year-old Furaha (meaning “Joy” in Kiswahili) and six-year-old daughter Flirt. They had been spending time in the north of their range and, although we shall never know, there is speculation that she was fatally attacked by Mitumba males—for she had shown no signs of ill health. To our delight, little Flirt showed up some weeks later. She often travelled with one or the other of her older brothers, Freud or Frodo.</p>
<p>Fifi was an incredibly successful mother—between 1971 and 2002 she gave birth to nine offspring, seven of whom are alive and well as I write. As she got older and rose in rank to become alpha female, so the intervals between births grew shorter. Her children all had different fathers, except for Fanni and Flossi, who are full sisters, fathered by Goblin. Fifi was a very special chimpanzee. I had known her since she was a tiny infant and there was a strange bond between us. Gombe, for me, can never be quite the same again.</p>
<p>But her sons and daughters and grandchildren are much in evidence: What an amazing family. We have seen how Flo’s son Figan, with the help of his brother, rose to become a powerful alpha male. And three of Fifi’s sons, Freud, Frodo, and Ferdinand—Flo’s grandsons and Figan’s nephews—have risen to the coveted alpha position.</p>
<p>Freud took over from Wilkie in 1993 and reigned for almost five years. He was, for the most part, a very laid-back alpha and spent much time grooming with the other males. But he did display, vigorously and repeatedly, at his childhood playmate Frodo, keeping his young brother in a state of terror. I was there once when Frodo, emitting small whimpers of fear, was kept up a palm tree for over an hour while Freud sat calmly grooming himself below.</p>
<p>Freud lost his position when he fell sick during an epidemic of sarcoptic mange. He began avoiding the other males. And then one day Frodo found him, hiding in thick vegetation. The scene that followed was extraordinary—and Bill Wallauer captured the whole sequence on video. Freud, hearing calls from the group of males that Frodo had just left, at once tried to move away. But Frodo displayed around him and, as Freud screamed in fear, repeatedly shook branches as does a male who is trying to persuade a female to follow on a consortship. Freud, still screaming in terror, repeatedly tried to flee, but his younger brother showed no mercy, relentlessly forcing the sick male to follow him into the group of highly roused males. Bill was steeling himself to witness a fearsome gang attack—but to his amazement Frodo then protected his older brother, throwing rocks at the roused and displaying males.</p>
<p>Despite much opportunity, Freud is not known to have fathered infants during his tenure as alpha, but subsequently fathered Candy’s infant Cocoa.</p>
<p>In 1997 Frodo easily took the alpha position from Freud after the incident described above. He was twenty-one years old, in the magnificence of his prime and the largest male we have known. He never lost the aggressive bullying behavior he had shown as a child, and was feared by chimpanzees—and many humans too. The other males would often leave a group when Frodo appeared—just as infants used to stop playing when he arrived nearby. Frodo seldom groomed others, preferring to sit and allow them to groom him. He had no need to form alliances—he could make it on his own. Like his uncle Figan, Frodo was a very successful hunter. Unlike Figan, he is also very successful at passing on his genes—DNA profiling shows he has fathered at least seven of the infants of his community, five during his five-year reign as alpha. One of these infants was conceived during incestuous matings: Fred, the seventh of Fifi’s offspring, who died in infancy during the mange epidemic, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Like his brother, Frodo lost his top status during a bout of sickness. Indeed, when I saw him at the end of 2003 I hardly recognized him, so wasted and drawn he had become. Bill and I were sitting with him when we heard a group of males calling nearby; quickly and quietly Frodo slipped away into the bushes, glancing nervously over his shoulder. It seemed for a while that he would not recover, but eventually he regained his health and much of his bluster—though not his alpha status.</p>
<p>Faustino and his young brother, Ferdinand, were Fifi’s fifth and sixth offspring respectively. Faustino, Wilkie’s son, rose to second rank in 2005—but then became very sick so that he dropped to a low position. After recovering he once again began to challenge other males. Today he is the main challenger to the current alpha—his own young brother, Ferdinand, who took over (from an older male, Kris) in March 2008.</p>
<p>Fanni and Flossi, although close during infancy, subsequently parted ways. Fanni remained in the same general area as Fifi, and mother and daughter were often together. Indeed, as we have seen, she supported Fifi in her murderous attacks on Gremlin’s infants.</p>
<p>Fanni, to my surprise, was not the attentive, supportive mother to her firstborn that I had come to expect from F family mothers. She lost Fax when he was just over four years old. But since then she has successfully weaned two sons and a daughter—Fudge, Fundi and Familia—all three fathered by Sheldon—and is currently nursing a second daughter, Fadhila. And, as was the case with Fifi, Fanni’s infants have followed each other in rapid succession, after a minimum birth interval.</p>
<p>Flossi left her natal community and emigrated to Mitumba in 1996. Although the resident females were aggressive, she was assertive and solicited support from the males. She rapidly settled in a prime area in the bottom of Mitumba valley and has so far given birth to four offspring—son Forest born in 1997, son Fansi born in 2001, daughter Flower born in 2005, and a new infant born in 2009—also with the short interbirth intervals characteristic of her family. Although not the oldest, she is one of the two top-ranking females of the Mitumba community.</p>
<p>PASSION’S FAMILY: After Passion’s death, Pom, without the support of her dominant mother, received a good deal of aggression from the other females and after a year she emigrated to Mitumba. Unfortunately we lost touch with her, and although she was seen with a small infant in 1986, she was not spotted again.</p>
<p>Prof, as predicted, never attained high status. He maintained his close relationship with little Pax throughout his life. Sadly, he disappeared at the start of 1998. It is thought that he moved south, possibly falling victim to the Kalande males. We shall never know, but it is interesting that Pax led several expeditions to the south after Prof’s disappearance, and it was speculated that he may have been searching for his lost brother. Unlike other males, Pax never grew larger than an adult female, and as a result of the injury he sustained in infancy has never mated. He is unusually playful—a sort of Peter Pan in chimp’s clothing.</p>
<p>PATTI’S FAMILY: Patti became a high-ranking and successful mother. She had a very central range, overlapping with that of Fifi. Her mothering skills, initially terrible, as described in this book, improved considerably over time, and she did a good job of raising Tanga, Titan and Tarzan. Like Fifi, she began spending more and more time in the north. In 2005, Patti, along with five-year-old Tarzan, was observed on a consortship with Frodo far to the north, near Mitumba valley. And there a group of two Mitumba males and four females found them. Frodo ran off, but Patti did not manage to escape and was severely attacked by the males. Two weeks later she died and was found to have suffered many severe internal and external injuries. It was a horrific incident, but during the assault, a young Mitumba female persuaded Tarzan to leave his mother and escorted him to safety. This prob ably saved his life. He returned to the south and now spends his time with his older brother Titan. They are both Frodo’s kids and have inherited many of his aggressive ways—Titan, for example, is a frequent and accurate thrower of rocks.</p>
<p>Patti’s eldest daughter, Tita, emigrated into the Mitumba community, gave birth there to a baby that died, and then was encountered only infrequently until 1998, when she disappeared. DNA from fecal samples recently found in Kalande suggest that she is still alive and now lives in the Kalande community with a son. Tanga stayed in Kasekela in Patti’s range and has two infants, Tom and Tabora.</p>
<p>Almost all the orphans I watched so closely and described in the preceding pages have died or disappeared, in many cases along with their protectors. Gigi vanished in 1993 and little Mel died a year later of wounds inflicted by an unknown assailant. After Gigi’s death, Skosha, who had for a while associated closely with her, became a somewhat tragic female. I shall always remember seeing her, when all the others were sharing meat after a successful kill, creeping around below and licking a few drops of blood from a few leaves—all that she could get. But gradually her situation improved and eventually she acquired middle-rank status, although she never gave birth. She was thirty-three when she disappeared and we do not know her fate.</p>
<p>Both Wunda and Wolfi vanished, and although there were reports of two individuals, who might have been the brother and sister, seen in the community in the south, this was not verified.</p>
<p>Darbee has survived, though; like all orphans, she matured slowly and did not show her first full swelling until she was thirteen. So long as she stayed within the Kasekela range she was subjected to attacks by the females of the community, and eventually in 1998 she emigrated to Mitumba. Eight years later she finally gave birth to a healthy infant, Maybee. Her brother Tubee has always been a bit of a loner. He has been a mid-to high-ranking male for many years and has fathered one child so far—Gimli.</p>
<p><em>Fifty Years Later</em></p>
<p>When I return to Gombe these days and find myself surrounded by a group of chimpanzees, I cannot help yearning for the days gone by when I could glance up into a tree and instantly recognize who was there. For I do not know the younger generation. Only Gremlin and Gaia. And Fifi’s older offspring. And Wilkie. One by one the others whom I knew so well, with whom I shared so many fascinating, exciting or tragic hours, have gone. I find myself spending more time, as I sit on the Peak or by the waterfall, thinking of David Graybeard and Goliath, of Flo and Melissa. Remembering the excitement of new discoveries, the explorations into unknown territory as I found out ever more about the forest world and its fascinating inhabitants. Yet fifty years have passed since those days—half a century. We have learned much during those years about Gombe chimpanzees. What new secrets, I wonder, shall we uncover during the years ahead?</p>
