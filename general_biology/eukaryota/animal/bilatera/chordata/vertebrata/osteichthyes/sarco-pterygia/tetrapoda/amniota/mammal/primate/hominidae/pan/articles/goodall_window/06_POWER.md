IT IS ONE THING to rise to the top-ranking position of a community. It is another matter to remain on top day after day, month after month. Figan had attained his goal thanks to the support of his brother—and Faben would not always be around, for every hour of every day. How would Figan manage then if one of the other males should challenge the new order?

The test came all too soon when Faben, involved in romantic dalliance with a female, vanished for three whole weeks to the northern part of the community range. Figan was extremely worried—and rightly so, for Humphrey and Evered might well have challenged their new alpha had they realized that his ally was so far away. Every so often Figan would climb a tall tree and, from the higher branches, gaze out in all directions as through searching for signs of his missing brother. Occasionally he would give the long, loud screaming calls that serve to attract the attention of friends in times of need—SOS screams, we call them. But Faben was too far away to hear and Figan was forced to rely on his own resources.

It reminded me vividly of the time when, at the beginning of Mike’s reign as alpha, we had removed his tin cans: for he had relied on them during his struggle for supremacy much as Figan had relied on Faben. In his effort to compensate for their loss Mike had expended huge efforts to make his displays impressive in other ways. He had hurled the very biggest rocks, dragged and flailed enormous branches—even two branches at a time. Once as he rushed towards a group of adult males with a palm frond in each hand, he had actually paused to gather up yet a third. Only very gradually had Mike relaxed, realizing that even without his precious cans he still held the respect of the other males.

And now, ten years later, Figan responded to a similar challenge in much the same way. The frequency and vigour of his charging displays increased dramatically, and he was a past master when it came to planning and executing these performances. Thus he would, if possible, move quietly upslope from some unsuspecting group, then charge down. Not only did this give him an element of surprise, but it enabled him to appear at his most impressive as he bore down upon the group, flat out, from above. And, of course, it is less tiring to run downhill; there will be more energy to spare if, in the face of any insubordination, it should be necessary to repeat the performance.

Most effective were his wild arboreal performances at the crack of dawn when it was still almost dark and the rest of the group was still abed. These caused pandemonium, with confused chimps screaming and hurling themselves from their nests. Back and forth, up and down—Figan leapt from branch to branch, shaking the vegetation, snapping great branches and, for good measure, pounding, from time to time, on some unfortunate subordinate. The confusion and the noise were unbelievable. And then, when it was all over, their new alpha, all bristling magnificence, would sit on the ground and, like some great tribal chief, receive the obeisance of his underlings.

And so, as a result of high motivation, determination and the expenditure of much physical effort, Figan stayed on top. And when Faben finally returned to the centre of the community range, Figan was able to relax and enjoy to the full the fruits of his labours—the respect of all the other members of his social group and the right of prior access to any feeding place or sexually attractive female that he fancied. Power.

One day, soon after Faben’s return, I watched as the two brothers, who had been on their own for a while, approached three of the other males who were peacefully feeding on fallen fruits. As Figan, closely followed by Faben, charged towards them, all three screamed and rushed up trees. Their point made, the brothers sat with bristling hair and looked up into the branches above. Satan, a good deal larger than the new alpha, and in his prime, hastened down and, with loud panting-grunts of submission, pressed his mouth to Figan’s thigh. And Figan, utterly relaxed, utterly self-confident, laid a munificent hand on the bowed head before him. Then, as Satan began to groom Figan, Jomeo and Humphrey also approached to pay their respects and, for a while, Figan was groomed by all three.

Faben, probably because of his paralysed arm, had never become a high-ranking male. But as brother of the alpha he was treated with a new respect by the other males—at least when Figan was around. Faben probably realized this quite quickly, for, after that initial three-week period in the north, he rarely spent more than a few days away from Figan.

Some adult males spend a good deal of time on their own—Mike, even when alpha, had sought occasional spells of solitude. But Figan, from earliest childhood, had wanted to be in the thick of things, been happiest when part of a noisy, excitable group—males, females, the more the better. And Faben, now that he was spending so much time with Figan, became more social too. The two brothers formed, in a way, the hub around which the wheel of society revolved. The other chimps, particularly the males, were fascinated as well as intimidated when Faben, charging along with his splendid upright gait, limp arm swinging, hair bristling, joined in the already impressive displays of their alpha.

For the first two years of his reign Figan held a position of almost absolute power in the community. This meant that he could, if he so wished, maintain all but exclusive mating rights over any female who caught his fancy. Once he had proclaimed his interest by threatening any would-be suitors who approached too closely, his mere presence, close to the lady friend of the moment, was usually sufficient to inhibit the sexual advances of the other males. He established a pattern, taking over the community females, one after the other, when they were at their most alluring—during the last four or five days of their swellings.

Faben’s privileged position was very apparent at such times for Figan usually shared his sexual possessions with his brother much as he shared precious food items, such as meat. And Figan received a payoff for his generosity: Faben helped to keep an eye on the current lady friend when Figan was momentarily busy elsewhere. However, even Figan and Faben between them could not prevent their female from enjoying occasional clandestine intercourse with one or other of the frustrated lower-ranking males. Such opportunities arose when the attention of the alpha male and his brother was temporarily diverted. Once, for example, when Figan and Faben were intently watching a troop of colobus monkeys with an eye to acquiring monkey meat, three other males copulated with their female in quick succession: neither of the brothers even noticed\!

It always surprised us that the females themselves were prepared to cooperate in these illicit affairs. Because when Figan did notice he would race towards the pair and, very often, bash the female for her faithlessness. This made more sense than attacking the rival male—for a skirmish of that sort would have left the female unguarded and available for yet another quick clandestine mating\!

The male who sneaked the most copulations with Figan’s females was adolescent Goblin. He was utterly fascinated by sex and, incidentally, utterly fascinated by Figan, too. Because he was not perceived as a rival \(he was only nine years old when Figan came to power\) Goblin was able to maintain surprisingly close proximity to the succession of females with whom the alpha male satisfied his sexual needs. Thus, even if Figan’s attention was diverted but momentarily, Goblin was on hand to take advantage. And since the sexual act comprises no more than ten to twelve rapid pelvic thrusts, the briefest of opportunities sufficed—so long as the females cooperated, and for some reason they usually did. So closely did Goblin follow those tempting pink bottoms that he was occasionally able to snatch a few seconds of sexual gratification as Figan led the way through dense undergrowth.

Sometimes an adolescent male selects one of the senior males as his “hero.” He is attentive to all of them, but it is his hero whom he watches most closely, and with whom he is most likely to travel when he leaves his family. Figan, without a shadow of doubt, was Goblin’s hero. Often, after watching Figan closely, Goblin imitated his behaviour. One day I watched as Figan did a magnificent display, dragging a large branch, slapping and stamping on the ground, and drumming on the buttress of a large tree. Goblin, from a discreet distance, watched intently and then displayed in his turn, following the exact route that Figan had taken, dragging the self-same branch and drumming on the same tree. I was reminded of those times when Figan had practised with Mike’s empty cans.

Figan, for his part, was remarkably tolerant of his small and persistent shadow, but very occasionally, when Goblin got too close—when he was feeding, for example—Figan threatened him mildly. This would throw Goblin, temporarily, into a frenzy of apology. Sometimes Figan supported his young friend if he got into trouble with other individuals. Little did any of us realize then the far-reaching consequences, both for Figan and for Goblin, of this special relationship between them.

Under the rule of a powerful male the conflicts between the other members of the community are kept to a minimum, for he uses his position to prevent too much fighting among his subordinates. What motivates him is not always clear. Sometimes there may be a genuine desire to help the underdog. At other times it may be that the alpha feels his position is challenged if another male initiates a fight. I remember once when Figan and Faben jointly attacked a female during the excitement of a reunion. But when, a few moments later, young Sherry attacked the same female, Figan, a picture of chivalry, raced over, bashed the aggressor and so “rescued” the female. But whatever the driving force behind Figan’s interventions in the affairs of his underlings, his behaviour served to terminate countless squabbles. Moreover, I suspect that many would-be aggressors, anticipating the displeasure of their boss, exercised more self-restraint when he was around. Thus Figan, during the years of his power, helped to promote and maintain an atmosphere of social harmony among the members of his group.

During the second year of Figan’s reign two of the students—David Riss and Curt Busse—asked me if they could follow Figan, monitor his movements, behaviour, and relationships with other chimpanzees, for fifty consecutive days. I was not sure. Perhaps this would be too much of an intrusion into his life, make him uneasy or irritable. But there was a precedent—six years earlier Flo had been followed for sixteen days in an attempt to witness the birth of her last infant \(the attempt failed as the baby was born at night\). Flo had not appeared to mind at all, and Figan was as tolerant of humans as she had been. And so I agreed—on condition that the follow be called off if Figan became upset.

The marathon began on 30 June 1974 and continued until 18 August. David and Curt, each accompanied by one of the field staff, spelled one another every four days, so that while one of them was clambering around the mountains after Figan the other was writing up the information he had collected—and resting af ter the arduous four days of following. The fifty days with Figan gave us invaluable data about the behaviour and social life of one of the most powerful top-ranking males Gombe has known, at a time when he was at the zenith of his career.

In those days, when all the students gathered together for dinner, there was a great exchange of information every evening. Many were the tales told around the tables in the mess. There were Caroline Tutin’s accounts of the sex life of the various females, Anne Pusey’s descriptions of adolescence, Richard Wrangham’s stories of feeding and ranging behaviour, and countless anecdotes concerning the development of infants recounted by the various young people involved in the long-term mother-infant study. And now we had, in addition, daily reports on Figan.

During the fifty days there were two sexually popular pink females, and Figan monopolized them one after the other. The first of these was Gigi. Large and sterile, Gigi, who has shown one sexual cycle after another since 1965, uninterrupted by pregnancy and childbirth, is, in many ways, rather masculine. She has a mind of her own and does not submit readily to male bullying. There was no doubt but that, during the days when she was fully pink, she controlled Figan’s movements and thus those of his entire group. One day, for example, when the chimps were headed towards a stand of *kifumbe* fruits, Gigi suddenly left the trail and plunged into the undergrowth. Figan and Faben followed at once, while the others hung about, waiting. Some climbed to feed on other fruits nearby, the rest sat or lay on the ground.

Gigi made for a nest of *siafu*—those vicious, biting driver or army ants that are such a delicacy for the chimpanzee. Upon arrival at the site she broke a long straight branch from a nearby bush, removed the side branches, then carefully stripped the bark until she had made a smooth tool, about three feet long. She reached her hand a short way into the opening of the nest and, for a few seconds, dug frantically until the ants began to swarm out. Quickly she plunged her tool into the nest, waited for a moment, then withdrew it covered by a seething mass of ants. With rapid movements she swept the stick through her free hand, pushed the ant-mass into her mouth, and crunched vigorously. As the ants poured out of the nest in ever greater numbers, agitated by the intrusion, Gigi climbed a sapling nearby and, reaching down with her stick, continued her meal. Every so often she had to slap frantically at her feet and kick at the trunk to repel those ants that were finding their way to the source of the raid. Now that she was using one hand to hold onto the sapling while she fished with the other, she had to transfer the tool to one foot between each dip, thus freeing a hand for sweeping the ants into her mouth. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, she persisted.

Figan, meanwhile, had begun to fish for *siafu* as well. But after only ten minutes he left his tool and rushed away to pick off the ants that had crawled up his arms and legs. Faben then picked up the abandoned tool but after fishing for only a couple of minutes he too gave up. The two brothers then started off in the direction of those delicious *kifumbe.*

Gigi, however, did not follow. She had positioned herself, by this time, on a low branch directly above the nest and, from this place of comparative immunity, continued to feed on ants. So Figan and Faben sat and waited. After a while Faben lay and closed his eyes. But Figan gradually became more and more impatient. Seven times he uttered his characteristic “Let’s go\!” grunt, but Gigi completely ignored these pleas. From time to time he shook little branches at her, requesting that she should follow him. But he did not do this very vigorously, and she paid absolutely no attention. Only when she had been fishing for forty-five minutes \(with an average of about two stickfuls of ants per minute\) did she finally give up and join Figan. Then the three of them moved after the rest of the group.

The following day, when Gigi’s feeding preferences conflicted with his, Faben left her and went off with the group. But Figan remained faithful. For a total of one hour and twenty minutes, spread over five different episodes during the day, he waited patiently while she fed, grumbling his soft “Let’s go\!” grunts from time to time. But only when she had quite finished feeding did she climb down and calmly follow where he led. By the following morning Gigi’s swelling had waned and Figan’s proprietary interest in her ended.

During those few days when Figan and Faben were both dancing attendance on Gigi, one most unusual event took place, when Curt was following them:

“Just after they’d left their nests I saw Faben mating Gigi,” he told us that evening. “Suddenly Figan noticed and charged at them with his hair out. He actually stamped on Faben’s back. He stamped three times, quite hard, and Faben screamed like anything, and then waa-barked as Figan charged off. Just a bit after that, Figan mated Gigi himself.”

“That’s about the only time Figan has minded sharing his female with Faben, isn’t it?” I asked.

“I saw it happen one other time,” said Caroline. “That was when Faben was mating in thick bush—I don’t think Figan realized who it was for a few moments. They both looked surprised afterwards\!”

When Patti went pink in her turn, Figan did not make any obvious attempts to prevent Faben from mating with her. And after she had subsided there were no more pink females for the rest of the fifty-day follow. It would be crude and altogether disrespectful to an alpha male to describe here David’s observation, made six days after Patti’s detumescence, which led him to suspect that Figan, sound asleep in his nest, was dreaming about the sexual delights of the previous weeks\!

One evening Curt had an exciting story to relate. Figan, travelling with Faben, Satan, Goblin and four females, had begun hunting baboons. While Faben and Goblin sat below and watched, Figan had climbed slowly towards a baboon mother and her small, black infant. But she was alert and, although he chased her a short way, she easily escaped.

“Do you know who it was?” asked Tony Collins, one of the students studying baboons.

“Yes. It was that A troop mother with the blind infant—what’s her name—Hokitika isn’t it?”

“Well, I’m glad she escaped,” said Craig Packer, another member of the baboon team. We were all glad, although the future for a blind infant baboon was hardly rosy and, in fact, she died just one week later.

After that, Figan had remained up the tree a while, looking in all directions. Suddenly he had climbed to the ground and hurried lower down the slope. As he approached a tall, dead tree—little more than a post, with stumpy, broken-off branches—he had begun to move cautiously and silently. Peering through the foliage, Curt had seen, up near the top where the dead tree was thickly draped in vines, a very small baboon—little more than an infant. There was an adult male baboon feeding some thirty yards away, but he had taken no notice as Figan slowly climbed towards his intended victim.

“Fig suddenly made a rush towards the infant. He nearly caught it, too. But somehow or other it escaped and leapt to the ground. It was amazing—it must have been at least forty feet, that leap. And then the little thing landed right between Faben and Goblin\!”

“Now I suppose you’re going to describe a horrible, gory kill,” said Julie Johnson, another of the baboon team. “I don’t think I want to stay and listen.”

“No, it was okay,” Curt reassured her. “Just at that moment the male baboon finally arrived and there was a great commotion. The little bab got away. The male pitched into Goblin and there was a truly spectacular fight. I don’t know how Gob did it, but somehow he won and chased off after the bab. And just at that moment another big male arrived. We knew him—it was Bramble. He began to threaten Faben, and two female baboons joined in. Faben was quite scared and rushed up a tree.”

“Didn’t Figan help him?” I asked.

“No—he just sat and watched. In that same place where he’d almost caught the baby. Then, after a bit, he climbed down and the chimps all wandered away.”

In fact, Figan and his group hunted relatively seldom during those fifty days. There were eight colobus monkey hunts and seven kills—Figan, who has always been a successful hunter, made three of the kills himself.

Nor did they make many journeys to the peripheral part of their home range. Once they travelled far to the south, penetrating the overlap zone between their community and the neighbouring Kahama community. They heard calls that were presumably made by Kahama chimpanzees and became very excited, embracing one another, grinning, travelling silently, and spending some time gazing southward from a high ridge. But nothing further happened, and presently they all returned to the north, displaying frequently and calling loudly, as though to release the tensions that had built up while they were close to strangers.

Figan, as might be expected, spent more time with Faben than any other adult male, and young Goblin was often tagging along with them. Figan also spent many days with Gigi, not only when she was pink, but also when she was flat and sexually uninteresting. And quite often he was with his sister Fifi and her infant son Freud. Most of his interactions with the individuals of this community were, at that time, relaxed and friendly. He was so clearly dominant over them that, except when there were moments of tension such as during a reunion, he had no need for violent demonstrations of strength and mastery.

Unless Evered was around. And then Figan, joined almost always by Faben, displayed with unusual frequency and vigour. It was as though despite his position of great power, despite the support of his brother, and despite the memory of those clear-cut victories over Evered the year before, Figan still felt threatened by the rival of his adolescent days.

David was bursting with excitement one evening when, as usual, we had all gathered in the mess.

“I saw the most unbelievable attack on Evered today,” he said. “The whole thing lasted for almost two hours.”

It happened when Evered, by himself, joined the group. He didn’t see Figan and Faben at once, for they were feeding in thick undergrowth. But suddenly they charged towards him and he rushed, screaming, up a tree. Figan and Faben displayed below him a few times, then they settled down on one of the lower branches of his tree and began, very calmly, to groom one another.

“It was pathetic,” said David. “Evered was about twenty feet above them and he whimpered and gave little screams almost non-stop. He was watching them all the time, but they just ignored him and went on grooming.

“After that,” David went on, “Figan and Faben left the tree and did some more fabulous displays. They charged about together—four times in the next half hour.

“Then came the actual violence. Figan started it—he went leaping up into Evered’s tree and kept chasing him from branch to branch. After a bit Evered managed to leap to another tree, but Figan followed.

“And all the time Faben was charging about on the ground below and Evered was screaming, terrified out of his wits, and keeping as far as he could from Figan.”

David paused. “It was awful really, watching it all,” he said. “It was almost like seeing a cat playing with a mouse, because I knew that there wasn’t any way that Evered could escape—unless they actually allowed him to.”

By this time we were all caught up in the drama, tense and expectant.

“Suddenly Evered made a huge jump into a third tree,” David continued. “Figan leapt after him and Faben suddenly rushed up as well and they had Evered sort of stuck between them. And then they both jumped him together, and they all fell and just went on fighting on the ground till poor old Ev got away.”

“Poor old Ev” it was, for the brothers followed, and again cornered and attacked him. He managed to get into a tree and his persecutors continued to charge about in great excitement for a further ten minutes until, perhaps because another adult male arrived on the scene, Figan and Faben left and Evered, still screaming, was finally able to escape.

A month later Figan and Faben encountered Evered after a two-week separation. Curt observed the reunion which took place in a tall tree. It was tense and dramatic. Figan and Evered embraced, both screaming. The other chimps present were watching intently. They too were highly excited and screaming loudly.

“I was looking up, doing my best to see exactly what was happening,” said Curt, “when the unimaginable happened.” He paused dramatically and we all wondered what was coming next. “Well, you know what fear and excitement can do to your guts,” Curt went on. “One of those wretched creatures—I’m pretty sure it was Gigi—suddenly let go. I was absolutely showered with warm shit\!”

Of course we were sorry for him, but nevertheless the whole mess collapsed laughing while Curt tried to look pained and aloof. Poor Curt—he had had to leave all the excitement and go and wash off in the stream. He was lucky that there *was* a stream close by\! Fortunately he was with Eslom, who had recorded the details of the fight that took place.

On that occasion Evered was set upon by five aggressors, for Humphrey, Gigi and an adolescent male had joined forces with Figan and Faben. The attack looked—and sounded—incredibly violent and it was amazing that Evered sustained only a few small wounds. He stayed with the group for the rest of the day, but left before the others settled down for the night and was not seen again for another two weeks.

It was hardly surprising that, in the face of this bitter persecution, Evered spent less and less time in the central part of the community range. It really seemed as though Figan, with Faben’s help, was actually trying to drive Evered right out of the Kasekela community.

And then, quite suddenly, things changed. Almost exactly two years after he had taken over as alpha male, Figan’s days of absolute power came to an end. Faben disappeared—this time for good. Gradually the other males must have realized what had happened for they began to capitalize on Figan’s vulnerable position. In groups of two, three or more they ganged up on their alpha in dramatic confrontations. It seemed that he could never hold his own against them.

But by that time, in June 1975, there were no longer any American or European students at Gombe to record the events.
