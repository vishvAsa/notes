Recent studies suggest that non-Africans have descended from a common ancestor who admixed with Neanderthals 49-45K years ago. Thus, the spread of non-African sapiens around the rest of the world began then.

Neanderthals are currently not known to have drawn animals, though they made abstract art and hand stencils. It is believed that only sapiens had this capability.

The rock art dated to 51200 years from Sulawesi (below) has so far been attributed to sapiens. However, that is too old for sapiens as they started outside-Africa radiation only 49-45K years ago. Before sapiens, in Southeast Asia, there were Denisovans, Indonesian erectus (last seen 108-117Kya) and floresiensis (190-50 Kya). Homo erectus was probably gone by then (why is a question), and the hand stencils suggest it was not H. floresiensis. 

Hence, were these Sulawesi art made by Denisovans? However, there is a paradox. Denisovans are closer to Neanderthals, who never drew animals as far as we know.

Hence, we are left with the possibility that Denisovans, unlike Neanderthals but like sapiens, were able to draw animals. 

Or there was a lineage of sapiens that left Africa to reach Asia before extant humans. For some reason they left no imprint and became completely extinct for unknown reasons. This will be a great puzzle of human evolution that will be debated in the coming years.
