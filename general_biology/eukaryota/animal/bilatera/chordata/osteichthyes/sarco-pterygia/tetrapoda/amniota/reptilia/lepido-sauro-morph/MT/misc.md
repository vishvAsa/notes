## Bellows
Varanus lizard hunting. Most ordinary lizards face a constraint that prevents them from running faster than a certain speed: they use the same muscles to run and breathe, so fast movement limits airflow. However, Varanus lizards have a pump in their throat, the gular pump that acts like bellows to keep up their breathing efficiency while sprinting: that's how you can see it keep up with a mammal. Thus, it is likely its breathing capacity converged on some Mesozoic basal archosaurs with similar hunting strategies.
