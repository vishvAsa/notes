Reasonable review on the impact of Neanderthal introgression on modern sapiens. A big factor in the survival of N alleles is the selective pressure from infections. Interestingly, a study found that E.Asian came under strong selection from coronavirus(es) within the last 900 generations. Think about what the implication of that is for the so-called lab-leak hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2. 

Interestingly, several genes that might play a role in viral immunity show introgressed Neanderthal variants. Interestingly, the chemokine receptor CCR9 N variant has increased susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 in places like the Indian subcontinent; see [link](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/10/12/pandemic-days-6-genetic-risk-factors/) . This suggests that in the past, the CCR9 N variant might have provided protection against some other virus that became a liability with Wuhan. On the other hand the N variant associated with the OAS1 which codes for synthetase generating an immunity signaling oligonucleotide  increases SARS-CoV-2 resistance. 

Over at least ~200 immunity-related variants might have risen from N introgression. Thus we could say that a major factor for the survival of the Neanderthal within us was shaped by the concurrent and subsequent encounter with various pathogens primarily viruses. Thus, the role of the admixture in the conquest of non-African lands by sapiens cannot be understated.
