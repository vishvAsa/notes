> 50k year old pre-Clovis stone tools from Pedra Furada, north-eastern Brazil, were likely made by capuchin monkeys.

Stone tool use is definitely there other than in Sapajus, Cebus (both platyrrhines or New world Monkeys), Macaca, probably Pongo, Pan & Homo ( Catarrhines (apes&monkeys proper). Are we missing its wider use across simiiform primates? Also has it convergently evolved many times?
