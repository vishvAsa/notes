*Mission*

  


The Jane Goodall Institute \(JGI\) advances the power of individuals to improve the environment for all living things. While continuing Dr. Jane Goodall’s efforts to study and protect chimpanzees, JGI has also become a leader in innovative conservation approaches that better the lives of local people. In addition, the Institute’s global youth program, Roots & Shoots, inspires young people of all ages to become environmental and humanitarian leaders.

  


*Dwindling Forests and Chimpanzee Populations*

  


We stand on the threshold of a future without chimpanzees and other great apes in the wild. Where chimpanzees once numbered perhaps one million at the turn of the twentieth century, today there are fewer than 300,000 remaining in the wild. A key factor is destruction of habitat—Africa loses more than 10 million acres of forest every year, twice the world’s deforestation rate \(Source: UNEP\). Meanwhile population growth in Africa is faster than anywhere else, with accompanying poverty and lack of basic necessities.

  


*Meeting the Challenge*

  


JGI’s approach to conservation represents a philosophy thoughtfully developed by Dr. Goodall to help ensure success. In addition to traditional conservation tools, JGI addresses the needs of human populations in and around forest habitat—the only way to long-lasting, systemic change. Engaging youth of all ages around the world is also a critical part of JGI’s comprehensive approach to conservation.

Today, there are more than twenty-five JGIs around the world committed to supporting Dr. Goodall’s vision and mission.
