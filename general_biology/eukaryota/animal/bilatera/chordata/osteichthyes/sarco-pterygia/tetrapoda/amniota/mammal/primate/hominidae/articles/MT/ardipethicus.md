The solid black represents the current range where our closest living cousins the 2 Pan species are found. The * shows the site where the only known fossil chimp from ~545 KYA was found. Here it overlapped in space & time with an extinct grade of Homo, probably erectus. Thus, Image Pan and Homo lived in close proximity as recently 545 KYA. But the paradox is, where are the fossils of the Pan lineage then? While Sahelanthropus & Orrorin were probably close to the Homo-Pan common ancestor, most apes after that, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Paranthropus are are seen as closer to Homo than Pan. 

The genetic evidence suggests that even if Sahelanthropus & Orrorin were close the divergence of the two lineages, they continued to mate with each other down to the time of Ardipithecus -- it could have been from a population that, at least in the earlier part of its temporal range was likely still mixing with Pan. The estimated cranial capacity of Ardipithecus of around 350 cc would have been close to that of the chimp lineage around that time, along with comparable arboreality making them behaviorally comparable.
