Heard of a weird case of an old dog from a German guy: The original owners had given their dog away to a friend. They then moved far from their home to a different part of the city beyond a certain river. Their former dog suddenly appeared years later at their new place. It stayed with them for a night and then returned to its current place. It died a few days later. The new owner confirmed that it was missing for a day before that.

Don't know if it is made up or true, but there is a tale of an American dog called Bobbie that travelled 1000s of miles over 6 months across rough terrain to reach its owners after being accidentally lost.

Some dogs may use the protein Cryptochrome 1, like some birds, "to see" magnetic fields and find their way or to orient themselves N-S while defecating. But this case is unusual in that the dog supposedly found the new house of the former owner.

> This happened to my mother after my father died. My father used to feed this street dog and then they moved away to a different place. Same city but far away. Some time later when he passed away, the dog suddenly appeared a few days later and waited for my mother to come out.. buried its head in her sariâ€¦stayed for some time and then left..never to be seen again.
