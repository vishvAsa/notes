- Aka true flies
- use only a single pair of wings to fly, 
- the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as gyroscopes and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics
- foot of a fly has a characteristic form with double pulvilli (circled in blue) -- pads, which distinguish it from the distinctive double clawed foot of the wasp.

## Senses
> Wing of a Drosophilid fly. Stout sensillae (red arrows): mechanosensory organs -- like touch; thinner ones (orange) are taste organs. The hairs on wing surface are believed to direct airflow. Thus, a fly integrates vibration/touch-sensing with tasting compounds in microdroplets. - MT
