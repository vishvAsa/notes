      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/05/22/on-cicadas-and-their-kin/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those were days when I was the local expert on hoppers and to lesser extant on Hemipterans in general. They are all around and we had our favorite haunts to pursue these insects. The lake-side-haunt and the hill-of-ill-luck were the best locale to get these insects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more unusual ones were the rare Dictyopharids: &lt;em&gt;Dictyophara&lt;/em&gt; had a long nose and was usually found on grass the other was &lt;em&gt;Orthopagus lunulifer&lt;/em&gt; with a small and pudgy nose. The classic cicadellid hoppers have a row of spine running down the powerful hindleg that is used in jumping. Then there were the cercopidae which have a rim of spine around the end of tibial segment of the hindleg. Then there are the membracids with a sharp backward pointed notum that shields a part of the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
