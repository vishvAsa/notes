It is interesting to see a vR^iShabha show such affection towards its human companion. 

## Cows
In the wild, the cattle herd separately. The females and calves form a matriarchal herd led by the chief cow. Within these herds the adult females have close bonds with chosen companions. 

## Bulls
The bulls form smaller bands that meet with the former only during mating periods. 

The most dominant bulls go totally solitary: 'ekavIra.' 

## Lore
This word is mentioned only once in the whole RV in the apratiratha aindra chant where indra is termed bhIma vR^iShabha. 

However, the AV preserves a recension of the famous sUkta of gR^itsamada shaunahotra ending in refrain "sa janAsa indraH |" which is one of the other rare occurrences of the word "ekavIra" in the shruti which was evidently inspired by the solitary bull released to wander around:

> yaH somakAmo haryashvaH sUrir  
yasmAd rejante bhuvanAni vishvA |  
yo jaghAna shambaraM yash cha shuShNaM  
ya ekavIraH sa janAsa indraH ||
