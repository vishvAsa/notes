Humans had their origins as an ape in an incredibly rich fauna. A [recent monograph](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040618225004215) studies the fauna cooccurring with the primitive member of the human lineage Kenyanthropus platyops: pythons, Varanus lizards, gigantic crocodiles, several species of pigs, hippos, rhinos and elephants, an array of antelopes and bovids and several large cats. 

The primitive members of the human lineage appear to have lived in bands in close association with troops of the monkey Theropithecus. This gigantic baboon probably had a complex vocalization convergent on a primitive language comparable to what was developing among human-like apes. It is possible that the only living member of this lineage, the gelada, has something like a language, representing a stage close to what might have been seen in early human-like apes. 

Our whole "personhood" as a species was forged in this extremely dangerous African wild, and it still lurks in our midst. We suspect that the monkey Theropithecus lived in large troops and had intra-troop violence for the takeover of harems from alpha males. One wonders if the apes like Kenyanthropus had a more human-like social structure with violence between bands, with battles fought on trees.
