In the closing stages of the age of the dinosaurs, there appeared a small arboreal animal, perhaps just 50 g in weight. With the great extinction decimating the non-avian dinosaurs in the trees, they underwent an ecological release and radiated into the forms like those shown below.  They were the plesiadapiforms -- the group within which primates -- thus our ancestors from the opening of the Cenozoic. Little would have one expected that a descendant of theirs would spread all over the world like a weed by the billions.

We suspect their enlarged first incisors were probably a feature of their shared ancestry with rodents and rabbits. They had 3 incisors in each quadrant, like the ancestral placental, but one of those was lost down the line as modern primates emerged within them.
