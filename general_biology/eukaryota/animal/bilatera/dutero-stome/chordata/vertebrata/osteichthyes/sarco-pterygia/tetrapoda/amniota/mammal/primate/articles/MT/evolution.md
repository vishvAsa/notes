In the closing stages of the age of the dinosaurs, there appeared a small arboreal animal, perhaps just 50 g in weight. With the great extinction decimating the non-avian dinosaurs in the trees, they underwent an ecological release and radiated into the forms like those shown below.  They were the plesiadapiforms -- the group within which primates -- thus our ancestors from the opening of the Cenozoic. Little would have one expected that a descendant of theirs would spread all over the world like a weed by the billions.

We suspect their enlarged first incisors were probably a feature of their shared ancestry with rodents and rabbits. They had 3 incisors in each quadrant, like the ancestral placental, but one of those was lost down the line as modern primates emerged within them.

From around 56 to 34 million years ago, North America was a lemurian paradise with a diversity of lemur-like (adapiform) and tarsier-like (omomyoid) primates that went entirely extinct. Barring one migrant that might have reached around 30-26 Mya from East Asia, there were no primates thereafter until Homo sapiens invaded the continent 10s of thousands of years ago.

Between 30-26 million years back, about 5 million years after the primates had gone completely extinct in North America, a mysterious primitive primate Ekgmowechashala appeared in the Midwest and Western USA from Asia. It briefly established the primates on the continent once more before going extinct again. It may have been more distantly related to the lemur-like form Sivaladapis from the Indian Sivaliks
