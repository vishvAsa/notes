      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1596347480752496641.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A rather remarkable &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-04122-0&#34;&gt;study - Parasitic infection increases risk-taking in a social, intermediate host carnivore - Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;. The authors propose that infection by the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma changes the behavior of wolves and makes them greater risk-takers, thereby increasing their tendency to break off and found their own packs or become leaders of packs. They propose that this behavior brings them in contact with pumas that the wolves normally avoid and results in increased propensity for them being infected by the parasite on one hand and increased propensity to transmit them to the cat, which is the definitive host (where the parasite completes its sexual cycle), on the other. Thus, the parasite manipulates the behavior of the wolf, in a sense it even imparts the host with a possible positive effect on fitness, to further its own transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
