- inactivated / attenuated whole virus particles 
- DCGI approval for Phase 3 clinical trials in 26,000 participants in over 25 centres across India.

## Severe Adverse reactions
- 1 person developed encephalitis. Was threatened with a lawsuit.

## Efficacy
- The efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100 per cent (95%CI: 60-100), with an impact on reduction in hospitalisations. The efficacy against asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 70 per cent, suggesting decreased transmission in COVAXIN recipients.
  
## Dosage gap
- However, the immunity level produced after the first dose of Covaxin is not as high and "this means the second dose should be taken after four weeks to ensure full efficacy".
