Deaths 𝙬𝙞𝙩𝙝 Covid

(Grok):

> Misclassifications don’t change the raw count of bodies. The total number of deaths is what it is, whether we label them COVID, heart disease, or something else. That’s why excess deaths are such a useful yardstick here: they sidestep the whole “what’s on the certificate” debate and just show how many more people died than we’d expect based on pre-pandemic norms. 

So, if the total’s fixed, the question becomes what drove that excess. Misclassification might shuffle the deck—say, tagging a death as COVID when it was really a stroke—but it can’t explain why the deck got so much bigger in the first place. 

During 2020-2021, the U.S. saw excess deaths climb by roughly 20% over baseline, sometimes more in peak months. That’s not a rounding error; it’s a signal something systemic was hitting hard.

The COVID-attributed deaths—around 1.1 million in the U.S. by now—don’t perfectly match the excess death tally, which is a bit higher. That mismatch fuels the misclassification argument: maybe some of those “COVID” deaths were just coincidentally timed with a positive test. Fair point.

But even if we strip out every questionable case—say, deaths where comorbidities were the real killer—you’re still left with a huge pile of extra corpses that don’t fit the usual patterns. Flu didn’t surge. Car accidents didn’t triple. 

Lockdown stress or skipped doctor visits might’ve nudged up things like suicides or heart attacks, but studies peg those contributions as real but small—nowhere near enough to account for the full excess. Might’ve nudged up things like suicides or heart attacks, but studies peg those contributions as real but small—nowhere near enough to account for the full excess.

The timing’s the kicker: those death spikes track COVID waves like a shadow—spring 2020, winter 2020-21, Delta in mid-2021. Delta in mid-2021. Places that dodged big outbreaks, like some rural areas, often saw less excess mortality. That’s not proof every COVID death was correctly labeled, but it strongly suggests the virus was a major player in pushing totals up. Misclassification can muddy the why, but it doesn’t erase the what: way more people died, and the pandemic’s the most obvious culprit.

This was as obvious as Durante's nose, but lots and lots of people sure seem to believe that putting bodies in the wrong category changed the total number of bodies. They're dumber than an LLM. I have made this point ( misclassification does not change the total # of deaths ( or the # of anything else) MANY times, and I cannot remember a single case in which the person I was addressing understood it.

There were some people arguing (early in 2020) that probably lots and lots of people had already had Covid, which would have meant that lethality was a lot lower than the current estimates. Considering that PCR didn't work for very long after infection, perhaps possible. Except - for an epidemic of a totally new virus, nobody is immune, and growth is exponential at first. Which means that the great majority of all cases are _recent_ - and thus, almost all are detectable by PCR. So no, there weren't lots and lots of people already infected.

Jay Bhattacharya didn't understand this. When he later? did a better survey of baseball people ( looking for antibodies, which last) , he found the number infected was just as low anyone competent expected them to be. He was surprised. I was not. 

Why didn't Bhattacharya understand this? Well, I'd say that he doesn't automatically make math models for things, doesn't have the chops to rapidly see such patterns, to do that kind of analysis. Not unusual.

Grok:

> " an interesting point about the dynamics of PCR testing and epidemic growth. PCR tests are indeed designed to detect active infections by identifying viral RNA, so they’re most effective when someone’s recently infected and still shedding the virus.

> In the early stages of an outbreak like COVID, when cases are doubling fast—say, every few days due to exponential growth—a "short-memory" test like PCR would still pick up most cases because the majority of infections at that point are fresh. The lag between infection and detectability is small compared to the rapid spread.

That, and he was letting his druthers influence his analysis. He wanted low-lethality to be true, and like so many, let his desires influence his attempts at understanding. Which is a mistake, always.

Does all this make a Bhattacharya good candidate for head of NIH? Of course not: not much insight, and a wishful thinker. Unrepentant too, I might add. On the other hand, he looks damn good compared to RFK Jr.
