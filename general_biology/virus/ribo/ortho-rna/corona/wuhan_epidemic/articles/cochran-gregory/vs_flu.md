The COVID-19 control measures (masking, distancing, reduced gatherings, etc.) created what epidemiologists might call a "transmission bottleneck" that affected different respiratory viruses differently:

- For influenza (R0 ~1.3-1.5): The interventions reduced transmission potential below the critical threshold of R0=1, causing cases to plummet globally
- For SARS-CoV-2 (starting R0 ~2-3, increasing over time): The same interventions reduced transmission but often not below the critical threshold, especially as more transmissible variants emerged.

> Influenza got hit so hard by the control measures it looks like one of the 4 big strains of it *went extinct*.  COVID is just a different beast.

Understand that this is literally beyond the comprehension of many people. Half the population?  More ?
