chatgpt: "COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have significantly reduced the risk of death associated with the virus. For instance, a study in New South Wales, Australia, found that unvaccinated individuals were more than 16 times more likely to experience severe illness or death compared to those who were vaccinated. Additionally, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that unvaccinated people were 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those fully vaccinated. These findings underscore the substantial protective effect of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 mortality."
