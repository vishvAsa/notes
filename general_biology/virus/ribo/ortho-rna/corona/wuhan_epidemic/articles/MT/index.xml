      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;202107&#34;&gt;202107&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some sociobiologists have speculated that the long arc of the 1918 Spanish Flu was what led to the rise of National Socialism in Ger and the events culminating in WWII. This extrapolation is from the well supported correlation between behavioral/personality traits &amp;amp; disease load.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Wuhan disease has already caused overt aggravating effects: Some people have (massively) suffered while others have hugely profited. There will probably be long term consequences of this. There would also be a lot of other subtler effects where causality with be hidden behind a long fuse. In the occident this will entangle with the rise of navyonmAda &amp;amp; everything that would trigger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
