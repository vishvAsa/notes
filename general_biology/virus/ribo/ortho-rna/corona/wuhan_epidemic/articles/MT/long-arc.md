Some sociobiologists have speculated that the long arc of the 1918 Spanish Flu was what led to the rise of National Socialism in Ger and the events culminating in WWII. This extrapolation is from the well supported correlation between behavioral/personality traits & disease load.

The Wuhan disease has already caused overt aggravating effects: Some people have (massively) suffered while others have hugely profited. There will probably be long term consequences of this. There would also be a lot of other subtler effects where causality with be hidden behind a long fuse. In the occident this will entangle with the rise of navyonmAda & everything that would trigger. 

India of the recent centuries has been the land of ill health. It is conceivable this will be exacerbated by the effect of the Wuhan corruption. India being very receptive to bad ideas from the occident will also be afflicted to a degree by navyonmAda. However, there could be other troubles -- antibiotic resistance. The uniquely India mycoses para-epidemic gave a taste of these "side-effects" of possibly ill-prepared medical mechanisms. A lot of the details are hard to work at present. 

The chIna-s will feel enormously vindicated about their approach to things even as the western approach tinged by navyonmAda will look less shiny. However, the economic ascendancy of the west would mean that it will remain an attractive destination for seekers, like those coming in from the south into the US or Europe. Whether these might change the demography is early to say but they have great potential as a vote bank for piNDaka-s supporters & the occident will in the least see the rise conflicts from them at a small-middle scale. 

The Rus despite Sptunik have failed to control the virus and will face further decline.

South America will decline too with the talk of the Brazilian promise probably ending. 

South Africa is already on the brink. All these little events could be the effects.

The homecoming of Wuhan shows the ultimate failure of the lockdown strategy against a highly infectious pathogen. I doubt anyone really understood the best way to handle it from the beginning. Some countries which did well in the start ultimately succumbed to the newer strains. But a few things might be worth looking at with the retrospective lens.

### National strategies
- Italy & Iran: caught by surprise nothing much could be done. Being the first to be hit in an information-poor environment did not help;
- The Swedish & original English approach of "herd immunity": many say retrospectively it was good, but it was certainly not handled well by English & I doubt by the Swedes either.
- Some epidemiologists in the US/UK suggested a more directed protection rather than wholescale lockdowns -- my hunch is that this might have been the best for the US with high proportion of isolated nuclear families. However, it might not have been of much use in India with multigenerational families. We don't know how that might have gone as those proposing it were demonized.

#### 5 eyes
Did look at the pa~nchanetraka-s comparatively: clearly the antipodal "moated" states fared better than the parent island or the continental land masses. There could be many factors: 

1. the moat; 
2. the draconian lockdowns; 
3. vaxx enforcement; 
4. population density. 

To tease these apart, we have to look more closely.  

- Of the 5, Canada, like NZ & Aus was heavy on lockdowns & vaxx enforcement. However, it fared worse, though better than USA & UK. Canada has some densely populated centers close to the US border and is sparse elsewhere. 
- Australia also has a biased distribution of population to dense & spare zones. The fact that Aus still did better and is with NZ on the lower band of the case/death plot suggests that the moat effect was a big factor for the antipodean states. They shut themselves off from the rest early & got some immunity from the weak vaxx before they were stormed. 
- Canada adopted similar measures but could not do as well. The connectedness of its densest centers to the US probably had a role here. It again shows that contingency might have a bigger role than strategy.

Scaling factors also clearly play a role: what can be done in a 5 million people island country cannot be replicated in larger nations. Thus, even if the current wave is just an omicron strain, the chIna-s cannot do as well as NZ.


### Personal protection
Most of us bought into the chIna canard of fomite spread in the beginning: buying up disinfectants etc. (wonder if they did it deliberately.)

While I started using masks early & still use them like say in air travel. It is not clear to what degree they helped. Might have helped with the original Wuhan but not the more infectious omicron. The cloth masks & the callous style of wearing them common in the desh definitely did not.

#### Vaccines
My hunch based on the US data is that they provided some protection in the first few months -- especially against delta. 

There may be some background T-cell immunity that still helps a bit against severity. Perhaps the biggest support for this is that failed chIna vaccines have meant lower immunity against omi.

Multiple bi-yearly jabs -- seems quite useless especially given the way the mRNA vax has been developed & deployed: Israel -- case in point.

#### Natural immunity
Has to be best given all that we know of immunology: seems borne out by the Indian experience. The chIna experience with lockdowns till breakdown also seems to support this.

### Meds
Remdesivir: useless; Paxlovid: not great; Ivermectin: don't know. HCQ: probably useless. +++(treatment or prevention??)+++ 

### Aftermaths
- hard decouple the downsides of vaxx (cardiovascular effects) from those due to actual infection by the virus. 
- Has aided the cementing of navyonmAda, which might destroy the American academe going forward -- might take years by the disease helped.
- Economic: inflation/recession: resembles old yugachakra turn after 1918 influenza.
- Social: prediction: will see a widening gulf between the "haves" and "have nots". For some people, across professions, the pandemic has been a great thing. For others it has been terrible. The former will capitalize on the headstart to get ahead in the aftermath.
- Countries with good social cohesion perhaps did well in face of the overall bad scenarios and decisions -- still hard to assess. I wonder how H think India fared. The official numbers of deaths: not bad.
