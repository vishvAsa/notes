## Limits on population growth

### Dismal theorems
> If the only ultimate check on the growth of population is misery, then the population will grow till it is miserable enough to stop its growth. 
> 
> - Kenneth Boulding

Moderately cheerful version:

> If something else other than misery and starvation can be found which will keep a prosperous population in check, then the population does not grow till it is miserable and starves, and it can be stably prosperous.

## Criteria to judge models
- Does it answer some clear causal questions? (of the type: "Under conditions A, X leads to Y.") Or does it intend to make quantitative predictions?
- Is it sufficiently abstract (and therefore intelligible), and not loaded down with unnecessary details?
- Is it mathematically elegant (in a way that could contribute to building mathematical theories for their own sake)?

## Approaches
- Process based, open ended "theory"
- Fitting a model to a specific dataset/ outcome.

## Equilibrium
- At equilibrium, population size remains constant: \\(N_{t+1} = N_t = N^*\\).
- Or \\(f(x^*) = x^*\\)

### Stability
- An equilibrium is stable if any perturbation from the equilibrium dies down. Local extinction (N=0) is an unstable equilibrium - introduce a few individuals and population size starts approaching a different equilibrium N.
- \\(\abs{f'(x^*)} < 1\\)
