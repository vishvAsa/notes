## Unusual

One of the plus sides of the otherwise deleterious picture-scrolling on twtr the volume of data it offers on unusual inter-species relationships between normally antagonistic species: cats and dogs; Felis catus and Lynx, chicken and cat; dog and cow etc. It brings to mind something viShNusharman had described in his tales of such unusual alliances overcoming svabhAva-vairam. People have debated if other animals have the same "emotions" as humans. We believe that these are evidence for them being on the same spectrum of emotions as humans with much overlap among phylogenetically closer organisms.
