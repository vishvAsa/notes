## Pig, dog, cat
Objectively, a pig is more intelligent than a dog. Maybe a pig is more intelligent than a domestic cat, too. 

pig > cat(?) > dog. 

Yet dogs get more attention from humans. One can attribute this to 1. charisma -- probably, most people see dogs as more charismatic than a pig; 2. A dog connects emotionally more to humans than pigs -- they are primarily valued for this rather than just intelligence; 3. They cultivate a codependency with humans, which is definitely more than cats and likely also pigs.
