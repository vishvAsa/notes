In 1968, at age 79, António de Oliveira Salazar, long-time dictator of Portugal,  suffered a severe stroke after a fall, leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Believing he wouldn't recover, Portugal's President replaced him with Marcello Caetano as Prime Minister on September 27.Surprisingly, Salazar regained partial consciousness later that year but was left with major cognitive impairment and memory loss. To avoid shocking the frail ex-dictator (or causing a crisis), his inner circle maintained an elaborate deception for nearly two years until his death in 1970:They staged fake cabinet meetings and brought him documents to "sign."

A special custom-printed edition of the newspaper Diário de Notícias was created daily — edited to erase any mention of Caetano and make it seem Salazar was still ruling.
Salazar died still believing he was Portugal's leader — a surreal end to 36 years of authoritarian rule.
