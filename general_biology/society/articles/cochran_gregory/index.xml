      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people opt to copy really stupid customs that originated in their upper class.  Foot-binding. In Roman Egypt (Faiyum), sibling marriage was pretty common in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;representativeness&#34;&gt;Representativeness&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More often than not, immigration flows are broadly representative of the population they originate from, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Irish potato  famine, the poorest starved to death, those in trouble but with some assets bought passage to the US, comfortable people stayed home.  Roughly speaking. The point being that the Irish moving to the US were not wildly unrepresentative - not just the dregs, not an elite either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Salazar</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1968, at age 79, António de Oliveira Salazar, long-time dictator of Portugal,  suffered a severe stroke after a fall, leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. Believing he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recover, Portugal&amp;rsquo;s President replaced him with Marcello Caetano as Prime Minister on September 27.Surprisingly, Salazar regained partial consciousness later that year but was left with major cognitive impairment and memory loss. To avoid shocking the frail ex-dictator (or causing a crisis), his inner circle maintained an elaborate deception for nearly two years until his death in 1970:They staged fake cabinet meetings and brought him documents to &amp;ldquo;sign.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kaprun&#34;&gt;Kaprun&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On November 11, 2000, a train in a tunnel in Austria caught fire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12 people broke a window and escaped &lt;em&gt;downward&lt;/em&gt; along a narrow catwalk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many more tried to escape &lt;em&gt;upward&lt;/em&gt; , but heat and smoke also went upward.  They all died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
