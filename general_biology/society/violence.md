> Intraspecies violence resulting in lethal injuries occurs in a variety of mammal species1, and has been suggested to follow patterns explicable by kin selection2,3 and evolutionary game theory4.

## Interspecific
> Interspecific violence including lethal encounters has been reported across a variety of species and taxa and has been traditionally categorized as predation or competitive killing27,28.
> 
> Interspecific competition can involve (i) exploitative competition (in which a species indirectly competes with other species for common resources), and (ii) interference competition (in which a species attempts to free resources by interfering directly with another species in the form of aggression, intimidation, harassment, competitive exclusion, or killing of the interspecific competitor)27,30.
