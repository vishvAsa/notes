### Huaorani of Equador - feet
> The Huaorani people, who have a rich history of tree climbing as a vital skill for their way of life, have undergone physical adaptations in their feet. As a result, their feet have flattened over time.  
>
> Their main source of food comes from hunting monkeys and small game with spears and blowguns. The limited gene pool, continuous interaction with the challenging environment, and the need to climb trees have all contributed to these adaptations. In fact, some individuals in the tribe have six toes on each foot and six functional fingers on each hand. It's fascinating to note that the structure of their feet changes over time, starting with straight toes at birth.
