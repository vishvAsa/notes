      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/common-disease-common-variant/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;common-disease-common-variant&#34;&gt;Common Disease, Common Variant&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, prominent geneticists put forth the notion that a&#xA;given common disease was probably caused by a very limited number of&#xA;alleles. If so, that would have made life easier: testing and drug&#xA;development would have been simpler. The argument was that the number&#xA;of alleles at every locus should have been low way back in prehistory,&#xA;since the effective population back then seems to have been small.&#xA;This model assumed that most of the common diseases under consideration&#xA;had little selective impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
