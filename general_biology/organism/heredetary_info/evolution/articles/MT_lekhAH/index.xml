      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/07/30/end-of-crick/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the men who solved the crystal structure of DNA is dead. Francis Crick was a great scientist- man full of great ideas. His partner James Watson was more of gas and show.+++(5)+++ Amongst Crick’s other great contributions was the idea of the selfish DNA, panspermia and musings on the neural cognates of consciousness. The last of these topics was built up by Kristhof Koch, though it is far from clear if these insights help in dealing with what Chalmers calls the “Hard problem of consciousness”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1974242582033993746&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An acquaintance showed me AI-generated perfect human faces. They were more attractive/better-looking than real-life humans; thus, it was capturing a &amp;ldquo;Platonic ideal&amp;rdquo; for at least a subset of humans. Why is this ideal never/v.rarely achieved in real life?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two forces acting against.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious is the environment: even if you had the genetic potential for it, various environmental factors can damage it during development and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolution-teaching in India</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1666634215801094145.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A longish thread related to teaching evolution in Indian education: I heard via this medium &amp;amp;other that they had moved the teaching of evolution from the 10th class to a later class. In my days 10th class was the last year of compulsory school after which you could go to junior college or continue in school. We too did not have evolution in 10th class in our state. However, we had a little chapter on DNA which most students did not fully grasp as their chemistry was not up to mark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Intelligent life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1838098814818738537&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intelligence-emergence-on-earth&#34;&gt;Intelligence emergence on earth&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The earth is 4.54 Billion years old. For most of that period, Earth had life on it. From at least around 4.1-4.2 Bya there was life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The neural foundations for high intelligence &amp;ndash; say dog, cat or heron level &amp;ndash; emerged only in the late Triassic 227 &lt;em&gt;Million&lt;/em&gt; years ago. Thus, for around 4 billion years, earth had life, but not the foundation for higher intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tholinovory</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/notes/general_biology/organism/heredetary_info/evolution/articles/MT_lekhAH/tholinovory/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the early work of Sagan and Khare we conjecture that life began via tholinovory; however, it soon evolved away from tholino-vory and those that remained so soon became extinct.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
