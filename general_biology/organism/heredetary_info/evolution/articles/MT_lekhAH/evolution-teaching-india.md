A longish thread related to teaching evolution in Indian education: I heard via this medium &other that they had moved the teaching of evolution from the 10th class to a later class. In my days 10th class was the last year of compulsory school after which you could go to junior college or continue in school. We too did not have evolution in 10th class in our state. However, we had a little chapter on DNA which most students did not fully grasp as their chemistry was not up to mark. 

In our days the curriculum and most teachers were substandard; hence, it really did not matter much. In the ideal world, we would begin the biology course, in whatever class it starts (in our days 5th class), with the evolutionary theory. It is probably the most solid theory in all of science and can be understood by relatively simple-minded folks. Everything in biology would be taught around it. 

Now, I saw left-liberal mlechCha academics suddenly getting interested in India and piling on H in this regard. I'd tell them to GTFO and stick to their business -- they have forsaken common sense itself for the soraShaNDAditattva, so don't lecture the H. 

That said, it must be said education in evolutionary theory and biology might help wean the H of contrafactual fantasies they gravitate towards, such as OIT. 

It was recently brought to our attention that a major H organization was presenting material for H self-definition. There an _atheist_ was presented as one believing in evolution; while H, as per their definition, were portrayed as believing in scientific theories like ``quantum mechanics''! So there is a lot of house cleaning even in our pakSha. 

I was reminded of a mlechCha woman saying how a pretasAdhaka was advising her family when she was young to throw out a statue of Darwin because it was causing ghosts to possess her/their house.
