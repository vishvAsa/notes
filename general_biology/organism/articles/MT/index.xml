      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/i/lists/934873690050740224&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have not seen all the Star Wars movies but it involves numerous alien types various planets all over the galaxy. That makes an attractive and engaging story. At some point in my youth independently of seeing any Star Wars, I too used to think of the plausibility of such a universe, with numerous alien species interacting in interstellar conflict. I thought we were not yet part of it as we were primitive and uninteresting. However, the more I thought I of it, the more I became Fermian. That will remain restricted to the realm of cinema fiction. I believe what is closer to reality is that there are indeed numerous alien species but they don&amp;rsquo;t interact like the Star Wars aliens. Instead, each type mostly remains on its planet. If they do interact, then they do so at the level of microbial life &amp;ndash; like bacteria and archaea interacting to give rise to a new life form that includes us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
