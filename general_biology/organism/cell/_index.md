## Cell
Cells are the basic unit of life: they consist of genetic material together with apparatus to create and expend energy in order for the genes to survive and proliferate. 

### Differentiation
Cell take on different functions based on their circumstance.

### Reproduction
#### Asexual reproduction
Cells divide to form other cells. 'Mitosis' is asexual reproduction: copies of the DNA are made.

#### Gamete formation
Gamete is a cell with only one set of genes: it is haploid. It is generated during the first stage of 'meiosis', a type of cell division. During this process, gene exchange occurs among the chromosomes, so that the gamete formed is a unique combination of genes.

#### Gamete combination
The gametes combine, and a new organism with distinct gene-combination is created.

## Organelles
### Nucleus
Cell may be Eukaryote or prokaryote. In the former case, it has a well defined neucleus, with chromosomes, in which DNA is bundled tightly.

#### Chromosome Structure
Genes are contained in clusters called chromosomes.

#### Chromosome number
Cells may be diploid or haploid, depending on the number of genes it has. In diploid cells, each copy comes from one parent.

Ordinary human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes. 

#### Special chromosomes
Sex is usually determined by the types of sex chromosomes an entity has.
