A SOLUTION FOR LONG TERM SECURE PRESERVATION OF DIGITAL DATA
For any human organization (companies, institutions) the preservation of information or strategical documents due to their economic, juridical or patrimonial value is a major issue. Risks of loss of this information are increasing on very long-term.

In order to answer to this issue of conservation of digital information with high safety level, ARNANO developed a technology allowing « to reproduce » at a microscopic scale the documents on an extremely stable sapphire wafer. So it guaranties a very long life to the informations. The NANOFORM, sapphire wafer that can contain up to 10 000 A4 pages, is:

Extremely resistant, it can be stocked in surrounding air during several hundred of years and manipulated without extreme caution or maintenance.  
Forgery proof,  
Readable through the wafer by transparency manually or automatically  
Independent of technological evolutions because documents are not encoded.  
A “document” with probative value

*NANOFORM is made up of a sapphire wafer in the middle of which information is engraved at a microscopic scale and revealed by a titanium nitride coating. These very high performance materials allow the NANOFORM to resist to the most severe attacks:

Scratches and abrasion (Hardness of 9 on a scale of 10 (diamond))  
Water, saltwater, salt atmosphere, solvent and acid resistant  
UV and electromagnetic radiation resistant  
Thermal resistant (up to 950°C)


The unique know-how of ARNANO allows engraving a numerical document under analogical form with a very strong reduction (of X 32 to X170). This microscopic engraving is accomplished on wafers of “synthetic sapphire” of 200 mm in diameter. Any types of information (texts, plans, drawing, and photographs) can so be recorded on this extremely long life support. Information (up to the equivalent of 10 000 A4 page) so protected will have a life of several millenniums.


Directly viewable by means of magnifying optical tools.
