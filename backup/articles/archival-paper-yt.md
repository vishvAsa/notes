[0:00] What makes a print archival and does that mean that the print will last forever?   [0:04] check out today's video and you'll find out [0:13]  

## Archival Paper
Archival Paper [0:33] - they're using archival paper and archival ink   

Archival paper means that the paper will last for   [0:41] many years think centuries  
before it starts  to break down and become brittle  
think about [0:46] a very old book that might be 100 200 years  
and if  you try to bend the sheet it will just break off   [0:53].  
that's why acid-free and lignin-free are what  make paper considered archival  
because it's the [0:59] acidity that's what's breaking down the paper.  

### Lignin
now  lignin is an organic substance found in wood pulp   [1:05].  
the lignin breaks down into acid which will yellow and discolor the paper over time.  
now lignin's only   [1:12] still used in packaging supplies and newspaper.  
that's why newspaper yellows very quickly   [1:19]  
it's not used in pretty much any offset  paper inkjet paper  
and so you don't have to [1:24] worry about the lignins too much,  
there are other  environmental factors that can lead to yellowing [1:29] your paper  
or damaging it over time  
such as  pollutants in the air  
as well as uv rays 

### Acidity
now   [1:35] when it comes to acidity,  
all paper archival or not will become acidic over time and that is because [1:41] all paper begins with acidity when it's first  made  
(it) comes from organic substances  
and there is   [1:47] a buffering agent that is used to ph balance out the paper  
which decreases the acidity  
but there's   [1:55] really truly no such thing as 0.00 acid-free paper  
because there's always just the slightest bit that   [2:03] buffering agent gets as close to ph neutral as  possible  
but over the years that buffering agent   [2:09] breaks down  
and then thus the paper goes back to his more acidic state  
and then that increases over   [2:15] the years  
thus leading to breakdown and allowing  the paper to break down over hundreds of years. 

## Archival Ink
Archival Ink [2:22] what about the ink?  
now pigment ink is considered  archival ink and it's the main determining factor   [2:28] for how long your image will last.  
many think it's  the paper it's not it's the ink  
so if you have   [2:34] pigment ink then you either have archival  ink  
and whether it's on archival paper or not   [2:39] your image will last longer  
than with dye ink. 
now  dye ink - rule of thumb is usually about 20 plus   [2:45] years before fade,  
whereas pigment is about 50 plus  years before fade.

printer manufacturers will say   [2:50] 100 or 200 plus years for a pigment  
and up to 100  for dye  
but that's with lab testing.  
the technology   [2:56] is not 100 years old  
so that's using lab testing  
and also more ideal print storage conditions.   [3:03] 

## Print storage
which brings me to my next point  
that print  storage is key  
and also making your images   [3:08] last longer.  
whether you're using archival paper  and ink or not  
if you have poor conditions where [3:14] it's exposed to sunlight or air pollutants  
such as  kitchen smoke candles incense air fresheners etc   [3:21]  
those will all damage the print  
and it will fade  much more quickly or yellow much more quickly.  

## When to use archival?
[3:26]  
should you only use archival paper and archival  ink  
and this really just depends on the final   [3:32] purpose of your print uh  
we have many people  saying they just they have to have it  
and because   [3:37] they feel in the market they need to get it but  really think about what the end consumer is going   [3:42] to be using it  
for for instance greeting cards   
most likely people will not keep over 20 years   [3:47]  
so you dye ink on whether it's archival paper  or not  
all of our greeting cards by the way   [3:52] are archival paper grade  
but you don't have to be  archival paper because most people usually don't   [3:59] keep it that long.  
now if you're doing a single  one and painting in it  
and making it really unique   [4:04]  
if you want to do archival you can  
but like i said  our paper is archival  
it just i don't know if you   [4:09] need to go and buy the more expensive printer  to have the pigment ink with it um  

some other   [4:15] things people i know  
we have artists that like to  sell prints for like rule of thumb is  
if it's less   [4:20] than 40 dollars  
i don't believe people are usually  planning on keeping that  
and passing it down to   [4:25] next generations  
and so on so usually the  consumer is not expecting a print to last   [4:30] over 50 years or even over 20 years  
if it's just a  fun print they bought now.  
if you're selling prints   [4:36] really unique fine art limited run fine art  prints and or if you're doing portraits you know   [4:42] portraits people might want to pass that one down   
or at least keep a few prints and pass that down   [4:47] in the family  
those might be better to do at the  very least archival ink  
because even again if it's   [4:52] not on archival paper  
the ink will make it last  longer  
and those are conditions you might want to   [4:58] do that  
but if you're just a hobby photographer  or maybe you do some nature photography and   [5:03] you'll have it for a few years  
but you don't  see yourself having it again more than 20 years   [5:07]  
i don't really know if it's necessary to have  either archival paper or archival ink  
but it   [5:12] comes down to you and what you want  
just be  prepared that if you're wanting all archival   [5:16]  
it's going to be more expensive  
and certain  papers are going to take a lot more of your time
