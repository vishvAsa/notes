In 1690s, if you were in Kashmir and wanted to procure a complete manuscript of Kashmiri recension of Mahabharata having ~1.1 lakhs shloka-s, what would be the price of it? We don't need to hypothesize because there is a recorded sale of such a manuscript from 1682.

Aurel Stein acquired a manuscript of Mahabharata from Kashmir in 1898. The text was written in Sharda script and it only contained a few parva-s as it wasn't a complete manuscript. However, he found something quite interesting in the portion that he acquired.

There was a sale deed of the manuscript recorded in Sanskrit and Persian describing the sale of the complete manuscript by its owners. The date recorded comes as July 10, 1682. The deed was executed in the presence of a witness and Bhatta Haraka acted as the writer of the deed. Image

The manuscript was sold by Pandit Lal, Srikanth and others who lived at Didda Matha Srinagar and sold the manuscript having two volumes and containing the entire text to Guru Anand for 45,000 Dinars. The price may appear astronomical but Stein explains why it wasn't.

In Kashmir, the currency had undergone gradual debasement and during the times of Akbar, 1000 Kashmiri Dinars were equivalent of 1/4th of a Rupee. So, 45000 Dinars come to around 11.25 Rupees. To better put in perspective, one could purchase 88 Maunds of rice with it.

Taking one Maund to be ~25 kg (as prevalent during Akbar's time), you could purchase ~2200 kg of rice after selling the manuscript. If one takes the current average rate of rice at 3000/quintal, it's equivalent to INR 66,000. Not a bad deal for selling a voluminous manuscript !
