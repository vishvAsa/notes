**How to best preserve our knowledge (physical and spiritual) and texts?**

## Post-industrial age
The post-oil, post-industrial-age world will arrive (details [TM](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m)), with much unrest, by 2160 (or 2260 if ice-methane extraction works out). Lack of fertilizers will lead to famine and a big drop in population. Raw materials like plastics, copper, and lithium too will be rarer. Machines - let alone computers - will be scarce. So, electronic data will be ephemeral.+++(5)+++ 

(Even while the industrial age is going strong, 38% of web-pages from 2013 was not accessible anymore in 2024. [PR](pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/))

**How then to best preserve our knowledge (physical and spiritual) and texts?**

Lists of oldest surviving documents - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_documents)

### 6k+ yr
#### Ceramic microfilms
Ceramic microfilm [MOM project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_of_Mankind), which is a 1 mm thick rock-hard sheet 8 x 8 inches (20 × 20 cm). The tablets can withstand alkali and acid environments, but also temperatures up to 1300 degrees Celsius.  A laser is then used to etch character, full-colour graphics.

The smallest text size is 4 pt in Arial style. It is the still readable with the naked eye. The capacity  (of latin letters) is about 40 000 characters on the 20x20 cm surface of a MOM tablet.

Further compression - Holds 1-5 million characters of text that could be read with a 10x magnifying lens. (Half way during the development of the Cerabyte technology and patented this as a kind of ceramic microfilm) 

#### Ceramic colors
Special ceramic colors or stains are used by MOM project to print photographs and illustrations with 300 dpi resolution.

#### Clay tablets
Babylonian clay tablets have survived from 4000 BCE (=7k years). But they are fragile - and need to be preserved.

David Zaitlyn used morse in [2013](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~wolf2728/Clay/index.html).

#### Stone
Stone tablets survive from 3500 BCE.

Is there an automated rock engraver - to engrave given text into a rock slab?? (analogous to CNC on metal https://youtube.com/watch?v=SdSVMygb450 ) Want to preserve important knowledge.

#### Synthetic sapphire disks
Synthetic sapphire disc of 200mm diameter from ARNANO.



#### Religious oral tradition
Eg. Vedas.

#### Metal plates
Metal plates risk being stolen, melted and reused in a metal-scarce world.

Metal engraving is relatively easy with a CNC machine. 

Modern attempts:

- Rosetta Nickel Disk (Long Now).

#### Metal grammaphone records
Can even record sound for grammaphone.  

Voyager golden record - copper disk 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter plated first with nickel and then gold. The record's cover is aluminum and electroplated upon it is an ultra-pure sample of the isotope uranium-238. Expected to remain intelligible for more than a billion years in sterile space.

### .5-1k yr
#### Waferfiche

Needs only a magnifying glass to read.

#### Archival DVDs
- 1000 Years Archival Hitachi/LG Digital Storage Blank M-Disc DVD+R | 4.7GB | 3 Pack Jewel Case

#### Palm leaf / birch manuscripts
Last few decades to 600 years, depending on local climatic conditions.

#### Papyrus
Made from plant leaves. No fold-endurance - Used as a scroll. Degrades due to acidic nature.

Dead Sea Scrolls were preserved due to low-circulation arid atmosphere.

#### Microfilms
polyester based microfilm - .1-.5k yrs. Used for storing newspapers.

#### Parchment (Skin)
Treated animal skin. If reused, called palimpest.  
Parchments from 1600 years ago survive - many were in regular use for hundreds of years.

### .1k-.3k yr
#### Museium grade paper
Curators love these papers because they’re made of 100% cotton rag and have no OBAs. The base stock is both acid- and lignin-free. The coating is acid-free.

it must be manufactured using pure cotton fibres (a.k.a. cotton rag) or pure alpha cellulose fibres, which are naturally more durable than wood pulp.

Must still be saved from acidic mats and sunlight.

#### Archival paper
Archival papers are (~100%) acid-free and lignin-free.  
They can be made of virgin tree fiber (alpha-cellulose) or 25% to 100% cotton rag.  
Oft  contains an alkaline reserve of calcium or magnesium carbonate to prevent acid degradation. This alkaline reserve can be achieved by adding bicarbonate during the drying process, which converts to calcium or magnesium carbonate. To last at least 100 years, archival paper needs an alkaline reserve of at least 2%.

Still, atmospheric pollutants cause acidity and degradation.

#### Pigment Ink
\~ 50 yrs before beginning to fade.

#### Photo grade paper
Most photo-grade paper is resin-coated and designed to look and feel like modern photo lab paper. The core is covered by a thin layer of polyethylene (plastic) coating, which gives the paper its photo feel, stability (flatness), water resistance, handling resistance, and excellent feed consistency. 

All resin-coated papers fall short of archival-grade for two reasons. First, the plastic content is not technically archival by museum standards. Second, the resin coating is slightly acidic, which will deteriorate the paper over time.

#### Dye ink
\~ 20 yrs before beginning to fade.

#### Common paper
Paper, having acid, degrades over time.  
Wood pulp is oft used. Has lignin, which breaks down to acid over time.  
you can put stable ink on non-archival paper and still achieve 70 years of on-display life.

### .01k yr

#### Shellac records
Quite brittle.

#### Vinyl records
Last 100 yrs under good conditions.

## Retrieval/ playback
Grammaphone doesn't require electricity to play sound. It's relatively easy to construct.

## Storage
- Cold storage reduces chemical decay rate.
- Low humidity prevents mold.
- Store away from insects and rodents.

## Profession
- Record keepers
  - Recordkeepers are responsible for documents from the moment they are created by an entity up to and beyond the point when they are preserved solely as archives
- Archivists
  - Archivists tend to be responsible for records once they become archives and are thus no longer used for their original purpose.
  - Canadian council of Archives recommendations [2003](https://archivescanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/RBch6_en.pdf)

### Location
- Temples
  - one should have an effort to engrave important texts on to temple walls.

Other efforts

- Memory of Mankind [archive](https://www.memory-of-mankind.com/?ref=longnow.org) - Hallstatt/Austria
  - The geological structure of the surrounding rock must not destroy the archive.
