  <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<h3 id="importance-efficient-solvability">Importance, efficient solvability</h3>
<p>Superset of LP. Many problems in nature are convex optimization problems. Many non-convex problems have convex equivalents : see section on modelling/ specifying optimization problems.</p>
<p>(Nesterov, Nemorinsky) For any convex optimization problem, there exists self concordant barrier functions; so interior point methods and barrier methods can be made applicable: This is a non constructive proof. So, there exists a polynomial time algorithm for every convex optimization problem, but you will find it with certainty only if you can find these self concordant barrier functions.</p>
<h3 id="standard-form">Standard form</h3>
<p>\(\min f_0(x): f(x) \leq 0, Ax = b\).</p>
<p>All \(f_i(x)\) are convex.</p>
<h3 id="convexity-of-feasible-region-x">Convexity of feasible region X</h3>
<p>Optimization fn is convex, constraint sets are convex sets. So, X is convex.</p>
<h4 id="geometry">Geometry</h4>
<p>\(\gradient f_0(x^{<em>})\), if \(\neq 0\), defines supporting hyperplane for X at \(x^{</em>}\). Imagine contours of \(f_0\), with minimum outside X, colliding with X at some point \(x^{*}\).</p>
<h3 id="identifying-convex-opt-problems">Identifying convex opt problems</h3>
<h4 id="check-convexity-of-fesible-regions">Check Convexity of fesible regions</h4>
<p>Maybe compare with known convex sets (see vector spaces survey).</p>
<h5 id="any-equality-constraints-should-be-linear">Any equality constraints should be linear.</h5>
<p>Eg: \(x: h_i(x) = b\) not a convex set when \(h_i(x)\) is a quadratic fn. These could be replaced by 2 inequality constraints in the standard form; both of which would need to represent convex sets.</p>
<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
<h4 id="local-optimum-is-the-global-optimum">Local optimum is the global optimum</h4>
<p>By contradiction: Take radius R local optimum x; suppose there were y more than R away from \(x\) with \(f_0(y) &lt; f_0(x)\); then, can conjure a point z, a convex combination of y, \(x\) which is less than R away from \(x\) with \(f_0(z) &lt; f_0(x)\).</p>
<h4 id="lagrangian-dual-functional">Lagrangian dual functional</h4>
<p>Can easily get the Lagrangian dual functional: \(g(l, m) = \inf_x L(x, l, m)\) by setting \(\gradient_x L() = 0\) and eliminating \(x\) from L(x, l, m).</p>
<h4 id="certificate-of-optimality-with-strong-duality">Certificate of optimality with strong duality</h4>
<p>Aka KKT certificate. If feasible \((x&rsquo;, l&rsquo;, m&rsquo;)\) satisfy KKT conditions, they are optimal. THis is a good way of solving convex optimization problem.</p>
<p>Pf: From complimentary slackness: \(f_0(x&rsquo;) = L(x&rsquo;, l&rsquo;, m&rsquo;)\); from the optimality condition and convexity of \(f\), \(f_0\): \<br>
\(g(l&rsquo;, m&rsquo;) = \inf_x L(x, l&rsquo;, m&rsquo;) = L(x&rsquo;, l&rsquo;, m&rsquo;) = f_0(x&rsquo;)\). So, \(x&rsquo;\) is optimal.</p>
<h4 id="bound-norm-of-solution">Bound norm of solution</h4>
<p>All sublevelsets of \(f_0\) are convex. So, find a ball \(\set{x: f_0(x) \leq B &gt; p^{*}}\) which includes \(0\); then we can say that \(\norm{x} \leq 2B\).</p>
<p>Eg: This technique was used in bounding the deviation of the solution of a l1 regularized logistic regression problem from the actual parameters defining an ising model by pradeep etal.</p>
<h3 id="dual-problem">Dual problem</h3>
<p>Strong Duality usually holds. &lsquo;Constraint qualifications&rsquo; can tell you whether strong duality holds.</p>
<h4 id="strict-feasibility-constraint-qualification">Strict feasibility Constraint qualification</h4>
<p>(Slater) If there exists  some strictly (primal) feasible \(x\), strong duality holds. \exclaim{This is very general: some strictly feasible \(x\) should exist!} Generalizable to convex programs specificed using conic inequalities.</p>
<p>Actually, can relax constraint qualification to: \(\exists x: \)x\( \in relint(D)\) wrt affine plain \(Ax - b = 0\).</p>
<p>\exclaim{Applies to convex conic inequality constraints too!} Also, this is a way to get strong duality without using the global optimality criteria perspective.</p>
<h5 id="from-supporting-hyperplanes-view">From supporting hyperplanes view</h5>
<p>Consider the supporting hyperplanes view of the dual problem (see dual problem section). For convex optimization problems, convexity of \(f\), \(f_0\) ensures that  \(G = \set{(u, t)| f_0(x) \leq t, f(x) \leq u}\) is convex. So, supporting hyperplane at \((0, p^{*})\) for both G and \\(G'=\set{(u, t)| f_0(x) \leq t, f(x) \leq 0}\) are the same.</p>
<p>When the primal is strictly feasible, the supporting hyperplane at \((0, p^{*})\) is non vertical; so intercept with \(f_0\) axis is well defined; and the dual problem is feasible. Thence, slater&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<h2 id="unconstrained-problems-algorithms">Unconstrained problems: algorithms</h2>
<h3 id="problem-algorithm-framework">Problem, algorithm framework</h3>
<h4 id="problem-assumptions">Problem, Assumptions</h4>
<p>Problem: \(min_x f(x)\), f convex.</p>
<h4 id="algorithm-framework">Algorithm framework</h4>
<p>Produce sequence \(x^{(k)} \in dom(f), k\in Z_+\): \(f(x^{k}) \to p^{*}\). Input to algorithm: starting point \(x^{(0)}\).</p>
<p>Alternate notation: \(x^{+}\) for current iterate.</p>
<h5 id="as-iteratively-solving-gradient-eqns">As Iteratively solving gradient eqns</h5>
<p>Can be interpreted as iterative methods\<br>
for solving optimality condition \(\gradient f(x) = 0\): a set of non-linear equations.</p>
<h4 id="common-assumptions">Common assumptions</h4>
<h5 id="assumptions-about-f">Assumptions about f</h5>
<p>f is twice continuously differentiable, so dom(f) is open.</p>
<p>\(p^{*}\) is attained.</p>
<h6 id="strong-convexity">Strong convexity</h6>
<p>If f is strongly convex, \(f(x) - p^{*} \leq (2m)^{-1}\norm{f(x)}_2^{2}\); so RHS can be used as a stopping criterion.</p>
<p>Also guarantees that sublevelsets are bounded: \(f(y)\geq f(x) + \gradient f(x)^{T}(y-x) + \frac{m}{2}\norm{x-y}_2^{2}\); this ensures faster convergence.</p>
<h5 id="initial-point-assumptions">Initial point: Assumptions</h5>
<p>\(x^{(0)} \in dom(f)\).</p>
<p>Sublevel set \(S = \set{x: f(x) \leq f(x^{(0)})}\) is closed. This is hard to verify usually, except when all sublevel sets are closed \(\equiv\) epigraph of f is closed. This is needed, because some methods try to draw secants in the epigraph of f(x).</p>
<h3 id="descent-methods">Descent methods</h3>
<h4 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h4>
<p>\(x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)}+ t^{(k)}\change x^{(k)}\) with \(f(x^{(k+1)}) &lt; f(x^{(k)})\); do this repeatedly until stopping criterion is met, in each iteration: finding step or search direction \(\change x\), the step size/ length t.</p>
<p>This is guaranteed to eventually come arbitrarily close to the minimum.</p>
<h5 id="descent-direction">Descent direction</h5>
<p>\(\change x\) is a descent direction if \(\gradient f(x)^{T}\change x &lt; 0\).</p>
<h4 id="find-search-direction">Find search direction</h4>
<p>\label{descent:Search Direction}
See later sections.</p>
<h5 id="search-direction-from-optimality-conditions-of-approximation">Search direction from optimality conditions of approximation</h5>
<p>Aka Newton equations in some cases.</p>
<p>Maybe model f(x) with \(\hat{f}(x)\), to find a search direction: find the optimality conditions for minimizing \(\hat{f}(x)\) or f(x) and find \(\change x\) which does this exactly or approximately.</p>
<p>For examples, see section on 2nd order approximation descent.</p>
<h4 id="line-search-for-t">Line search for t</h4>
<h5 id="restriction-to-a-slice">Restriction to a slice</h5>
<p>\(g(t) = f(x+ t \change x)\) is f restricted to a slice along \(\change x\). This is convex as f is convex.</p>
<h6 id="visualization">Visualization</h6>
<p>Plot \(g(t)\) vs t, try to find \(t\) which minimizes this.</p>
<h5 id="exact-line-search">Exact line search</h5>
<p>\(t = \argmin_{t&gt;0} g(t)\). This is usually expensive.</p>
<h5 id="backtracking">Backtracking</h5>
<p>Parameters: \(a \in (0, 1/2), b \in (0, 1)\); b is the shrinkage parameter.</p>
<p>Start with t=1 (or small enough \(t\) to guarantee that \(x + t\change \)x\( \in dom(f)\)), repeat \(t \dfn bt\) until stopping criterion is met:
\(f(x + t \change x) &lt; f(x) + at\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x\). With shrinkage of t, the RHS reduces. This is aka Armijo&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>Can be rewritten as \(f(x + t \change x)- f(x) &lt; ah(t)\), where h(t) is the change in f for t, according to a linear approximation of \(f\). This form is useful when f() is composed of differentiable and non-differentiable parts.</p>
<h6 id="guaranteed-reduction-in-objective">Guaranteed reduction in objective</h6>
<p>As \(\change x\) is a descent direction, \<br>
\(\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x &lt; 0\).</p>
<p>So, when \(f(x + t \change x) &lt; f(x) + at\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x\), we have \(f(x + t \change x) &lt; f(x)\), so it is a step size which definitely reduces f().</p>
<p>Such a \(t\) will always exist: you keep decreasing \(t\) until that happens.</p>

<p>Take \(g(t):R \to R\): one dim fn. Consider \(\gradient_t g(t)\) at t=0.
\(\gradient_t g(0) = \gradient_x f(x) \change \)x\( \leq 0\). \(g(0) + at\gradient_t g(0) = f(x) + at\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x\), when a=1, is the tangent to g(t) at t=0, and therefore to f(x). \(f(x) + at\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x\), for \(a&lt;1\) is such a secant: you are making the slope less negative.</p>
<p>x changes along the search direction only, but you change \(t \in [0, t_{0}]\), to get \(t\) which is close (from below) to the intersection of a secant in the epigraph of g(t) with g(t).</p>
<p>As \(f(x) + at\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x\) is a secant, for the stopping condition should be met for some \(t\) if \(\change x\) is indeed a descent direction. This ensures that \(t\) is such that \(f(x + t \change x) - f(x) \approx  at\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x\), the improvement achieved by using a secant.</p>
<h6 id="variants">Variants</h6>
<p>Rather than ensure that \(t\) is such that \<br>
\(f(x + t \change x) - f(x) \approx  ah(t)\), the improvement achieved by using a secant; one can use second order approximations instead to define h, rather than a linear approximation: this perspective is different from the &lsquo;secant view&rsquo;.</p>
<h5 id="arbitrary-choice">Arbitrary choice</h5>
<p>Using backtracking rule or doing exact search during line search guarantee reduction in the objective (and therefore convergence), but they can be expensive. An alternative can be to just use 1 as the step length.</p>
<p>The cost of doing so is that convergence is no longer guaranteed: it is possible for example that, taking the step 1 repeatedly, one cycles between the same pair of points between which lies the optimal point. However, in practice, convergence is usually observed.</p>
<p>This technique is used, for example, in \<br>

<p>Consider contours/ level sets of \(f:R^{2} \to R\). The level set \(\set{x:f(x) = t}\) surrounds \(\set{x:f(x) = t-1}\); etc.. At \(x: f(x) = t\), the \(\gradient f(x)\) is perpendicular to level set \(\set{x:f(x) = t}\), pointing away from \(\set{x:f(x) = t-1}\); and so is the gradient descent direction; but it points towards \(\set{x:f(x) = t-1}\).</p>
<h5 id="goodness-for-circular-level-set-case">Goodness for circular level set case</h5>
<p>If the level set contours are circular, then \(-\gradient f(x)\) points straight towards the minimum level set. But, consider an ellipsoid. Then, \(-\gradient f(x)\) is passes through a few level sets \(\set{x:f(x) = t&rsquo; &lt; t}\), but it misses many smaller level sets. Eg: imagine level sets which are shaped like concentric rounded triangles.</p>

<p>If you choose a good \(\norm{.}\), the shape of whose unit ball approximates the shape of the level sets/ contours, \(\change x\) will be such that it points towards the minimal contour of \(f\), while still having a large enough inner product with \(-\gradient f(x)\) to guarantee that it is a descent direction. So, you can get to \(x^{*}\) more directly.</p>

<p>Note: picking \(\norm{x} = (\dprod{x^{T} Px})^{1/2}\) for \(P \succeq 0\) yields ellipsoid unit balls. This can be thought of taking: \(\hat{f}(x + v) = f(x) + \dprod{\gradient f(x), v} + 2^{-1} v^{T}Pv\) and using \(\inf_v \hat{f}(x + v)\) as the search direction.</p>

<p>Equals length of \(\change x\) in the local Hessian norm : see steepest descent connection.</p>
<p>Also measures the \(\change x\) directional derivative, \(\gradient f(x)^{T} \change x = -\gl(x)^{2}\). So, it measures how close \(\gradient f(x)\) is to being 0, as it is at \(x^{*}\).</p>
<p>This is also affine invariant, unlike \(\norm{x}\). Pf: Consider x = Ax&rsquo; +b. Consider \(D_{x&rsquo;}f(Ax'+b) = D_{Ax'+b}f(Ax'+b)A = D_{x}f(x)A\); thence get \(\gradient_{x&rsquo;} f(Ax'+b)\), and thence \(\gradient_{x&rsquo;}^2 f(Ax'+b) = D_{x&rsquo;} \gradient_{x&rsquo;} f(Ax'+b)\).</p>

So, dual problem: \(\max \dprod{A_0, Z}: Z \succeq 0, \dprod{A_i, Z} + c_i = 0 \forall i\). (Note: used self-duality of \(S_{++}^{n}\) in writing \(Z \succeq 0\).) \exclaim{Also an SDP!}</p>
<p>Dual of dual is the primal!: Use \(L(Z, m, L) = \dprod{G, Z} + \sum_i m_i  \dprod{F_i, Z} + \dprod{L, -Z} + c^{T}m\).</p>

<p>The main difficulty here arises from the presence of a large number of local optima.</p>

<h3 id="convexification-smoothing">Convexification/ smoothing</h3>
<p>Turn it into a convex optimization problem: eg change objective fn to \(e^{x}\), or maybe strong duality holds: so can solve dual problem: see section on modelling/ formulating problems too.</p>
<h4 id="dual-of-the-dual">Dual of the dual</h4>
<p>Dual of the dual is sometimes a convex relaxation to the original problem, besides being a lower bound to it.</p>
<h4 id="local-approximation">Local approximation</h4>
<p>Or approximate \(f_0\) (maybe locally) by a convex function or atleast a smoother function. Eg: Trust region methods.</p>
<h4 id="smoothing">Smoothing</h4>
<p>Smoothing reduces irregularity of the function output - ie it reduces the depth of local minima.</p>
<p>Gaussian smoothing is frequently used: \(g(x_0) = \int_{x \in [-\infty, \infty] } e^{-\gl (x-x_0)^{2}} f(x) dx\).</p>
<h3 id="as-sampling">As sampling</h3>
<p>Global optimization can be seen as sampling from the feasible set, using anything monotonic with \(f_0(w) = E(w)\) as a measure of energy/ improbability - albeit with the intention of finding the minimum.</p>
<p>In exploring the feasible set with special attention towards finding an optimum, one would want most updates to improve the objective, while the remaining updates help get out of local minima.</p>
<h4 id="stochastic-gradient-descent">Stochastic gradient descent</h4>
<p>Often the objective function can be decomposed as follows: \(E(w) = \sum_{i=1:n} E_i(w)\) - for example, in terms of various data-points in the case of maximum likelihood esitation.</p>
<p>Here, for each iteration, one chooses a data-point \(E_i(w)\) at random or in a sequence, and uses \(-\gradient E_i(w)\) as a descent direction.</p>
<h5 id="comparison-with-stochastic-gradient-descent">Comparison with stochastic gradient descent</h5>
<p>Unlike gradient descent, which, using \(\gradient E(w)\) as a direction, can consistently reduce E(w) if the step size is appropriately chosen, stochastic gradient descent does not make such a guarantee. The advantage of stochastic gradient descent is in not being stuck at local optima, and in the greater speed with which \(\gradient E_i(w)\) can be evaluated.</p>
<h4 id="damping-jitters">Damping jitters</h4>
<p>Sampling techniques may sometimes result in excessive oscillations in the value of \(E(w)\) after each variable update: \(w_i = w_{i-1} + \change w_{i-1}\), where \(\change w_{i-1} = \ga t_{i-1}\) using step size \(\ga\) and direction \(t_{i-1}\).</p>
<p>One may use a momentum parameter to dampen the abrupt changes in direction: \(\change w_{i-1} =  \change w_{i-2} + \ga t_{i-1}\).</p>
<p>This is beneficial because in exploring the feasible set with special attention towards finding an optimum, one would want most updates to improve the objective, while the remaining updates help get out of local minima.</p>
<h4 id="using-distribution-sampling-techniques">Using distribution sampling techniques</h4>
<p>See section on sampling from a distribution in randomized algorithms survey. Note that in sampling for optimization, algorithms may pay attention towards finding optima.</p>
<h2 id="local-optimization">Local optimization</h2>
<h3 id="result">Result</h3>
<p>The result is often highly sensitive to the initial value of \(x\). Also, one cannot guarantee that one will reach the minimum closest to the initial point: For example, when gradient descent is used, the angle of the gradient may lead one to a point which then leads a different well.</p>

<h2 id="optimal-substructure-problems">Optimal substructure problems</h2>
<p>Aka Dynamic programming.</p>
<h3 id="applicability-decision-tree-view">Applicability: Decision tree view</h3>
<p>The problem can be cast as one of taking a sequence of decisions, and one wants to find the optimal sequence of decisions. So, essentially, one tries to find the optimal path through a decision tree. The number of decisions one needs to take is bounded by \(N\).</p>
<p>Problems exhibit the &lsquo;optimal substructure&rsquo; property, and also often the &lsquo;overlapping subproblems&rsquo; property.</p>
<h4 id="optimal-substructure">Optimal substructure</h4>
<p>Optimal solutions of simpler subproblems can be compared in some way to find the overall optimal solution.</p>
<p>A problem corresponds to a decision tree \(D_l\) at level \(l\). Each subproblem corresponds to finding optimal path \(p_i\) through a different decision subtree \(D_i\) one would arrive at by fixing the first decision to be \(e_i\). One constructs the optimal decision path \(p= \min_i f(p_i + e_i)\).</p>
<p>Eg: In case of shortest path problem: \(d(s, e) = \min_{v \in \nbd(s)}[d(s, v) + d(v, e)]\).</p>
<h5 id="remembering-subproblems-used">Remembering subproblems used</h5>
<p>\(p\) is a sequence of decisions \(d_{l, i}\) - each corresponding to making decision \(i\) at level \(l\) of the decision tree. One needs to remember the decision taken at level \(l\) - the optimal subpath augmented. Eg: in the example above, in order to reconstruct the shortest path from s to e, one needs to remember which \(v \in \nbd(s)\) was used.</p>
<h4 id="overlapping-subproblems">Overlapping subproblems</h4>
<p>The subproblems solved are repeated. This corresponds to the case where decision sub-paths to various leaves are actually identical. So it is profitable to remember solutions to subproblems.</p>
<h3 id="top-down-vs-bottom-up">Top down vs Bottom up</h3>
<h4 id="top-down-solution">Top down solution</h4>
<p>A top down solution can be easily expressed in terms of a recursive function \(f(D)\) which acts on a certain decision tree and returns a] the optimal decision path \(p\) and b] its cost.</p>
<p>In doing this, if the &lsquo;overlapping subproblem&rsquo; property holds, the algorithm memoizes : ie remembers optimal solutions to these subproblems whenever they are solved.</p>
<h4 id="bottom-up">Bottom up</h4>
<p>This solution is only applicable when the &lsquo;overlapping subproblem&rsquo; property holds.</p>
<p>The algorithm solves decision trees of the smallest depth, records their results and builds solutions to progressively larger decision trees. So, one goes from level \(N\) and works one&rsquo;s way up to level \(1\).</p>
<h5 id="tabular-view">Tabular view</h5>
<p>Suppose that any node in the decision tree has at most \(N\) children. This process can be viewed by means of a \(N \times M\) table or a list of \(N\) lists.</p>
<p>First, one constructs a list or column corresponding to the consequences of \(M\) different decisions at level \(N\).</p>
<p>Then, one constructs a list corresponding to the consequences of \(M\) decisions at level \(N-1\), and also a list of &lsquo;backpointers&rsquo; specifying the ideal decision at level \(N\) if one were to fix decision \(d\) at level \(N-1\).</p>
<p>One does this unductively until one covers all decisions up to level \(1\).</p>
<h4 id="time-complexity">Time complexity</h4>
<p>From description of the bottom up solution, it is clear that time/ space required is \(M*N\) - unlike \(M^N\) in case all paths in the entire decision tree are to be considered (true in case &lsquo;overlapping subproblems&rsquo; property does not hold).</p>

<p>Systematic enumeration of all candidate solutions, where large subsets of fruitless candidates are discarded en masse, by using upper and lower estimated bounds of the quantity being optimized.</p>
<h2 id="with-belief-propogation">With belief propogation</h2>
<p>Rewrite as a problem of finding the mode of a distribution: \(\max_x Pr(x): Pr(x) \propto 1_{f(x) \leq 0, h(x) = 0} e^{f_0(x)}\): the exponentiation is to ensure non-negativity.</p>
<p>This is useful when \(f_0, \)f\(, h\) are decomposable into functionals over cliques: then can take advantage of factorization.</p>
