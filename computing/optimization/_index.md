Aka Mathematical programming.

Notation: Vector space V, field F.

## Solver design
Make fast solvers for specific classes of problems.

Make specification frameworks (see later section).

## Applications of Constrained optimization
Convex optimization problems found widely in nature.

Untrained intuition is not very good at recognizing and formulating proper optimization problems: easy problems appear hard.
