\section{1: 2.1: Convex combinations of points in a convex set}
\subsection{To prove}
Let C be a convex set. Show that convex combinations of any number of points is also in C.

\subsection{Proof by induction}
\subsubsection{Notation}
Below, we assume that $x_i\in C, t_i \geq 0$.

\subsubsection{Base case}
By definition, if C is a convex set, for $t_1 + t_2 = 1$, $t_1 x_1 + t_2 x_2 \in C$.

\subsubsection{Induction}
Assume that, for some $k \geq 2, \sum_{i=1}^{k} t_i = 1, \sum_{i=1}^{k}t_ix_i \in C$ for any set of k points in C. Then, we will show that, if $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} t_i = 1$, $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}t_ix_i \in C$ for any set of k+1 points in C.

$\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}t_ix_i  = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_i}\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_ix_i + t_{k+1}x_{k+1}$. But, by our inductive assumption, as  $(\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_i)^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_ix_i$ is some $x' \in C $. So, $\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}t_ix_i  = (\sum_{i=1}^{k}t_i) x' + t_{k+1}x_{k+1} \in C$, again by our inductive assumption.

\section{2: 2.5: Distance between hyperplanes}
Take 2 parallel hyperplanes: $\set{x \in R^{n}: a^{T}x = b_1}, \set{x \in R^{n}: a^{T}x = b_2}$. The vector a is perpendicular to both planes, so the distance should be measured along this vector. Considering the point along $a$ which lies on these planes, we see that the distance from the origin of these planes is $\frac{b_i}{\norm{a}}$. So, the distance between these planes is $(\norm{a}^{-1}|b_1 - b_2|)$.

\section{3: 2.6: containment of halfspaces}
Consider halfspaces $H_1 = \set{x \in R^{n}: a_1^{T}x \leq b_1}, H_2 = \set{x \in R^{n}: a_2^{T}x \leq b_2}$, with $a_i \neq 0$.

\subsection{Condition for containment}
By geometric intuition, we see that one halfspace contains the other only if the hyperplanes defining the halfspaces are parallel. $a_i$ is the vector which is perpendicular to the hyperplane defining halfspace $H_i$. So, for hyperplanes to be parallel, $a_1, a_2$ should be collinear; ie: $a_1 = k a_2$ for some scalar k. Furthermore, both half spaces should lie on the same side of the defining hyperplanes. To ensure this, we need the additional condition that $sign(b_1 b_2) = sign(k)$.

\subsection{Condition for equality}
For two halfspaces to be equal, they should contain each other. So, the \textbf{conditions mentioned earlier should hold}. As the hyperplane defining both halfspaces is exactly the same, we need the following condition to ensure that these hyperplanes are of equal distance from the origin: $\frac{b_1}{\norm{a_1}} = \frac{b_2}{\norm{a_2}}$. Using the condition that $a_1 = k a_2$, we can state this as: $\frac{b_1}{b_2} = k$.
