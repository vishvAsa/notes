\section{The illumination problem}
\subsection{The problem}
$\min_p g_0(p) = max_{k \in [1,n]} h(a_k^{T}p) : \forall j p_j \in [0,1]$.

$f_0(p) = \log g_0(p)$.

\subsection{a Problem instance}

\subsection{b Equal lamp powers}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{code/equalPowers.jpg}

Graphically, the optimal power associated with each lamp seems to be 0.35.

\subsection{c Least squares with saturation}
$\min \norm{Ap - 1}$, set values of $p_i >1$ to 1, and values $p_i<0$ to 0.

Least squares with saturattion: 8.627836e-01.

\subsection{d Regularized least squares}
$\min \norm{Ap - 1}^{2} + l \norm{p - (1/2)1}^{2}$. We want to find l which satisfies that atleast one i has $p_i \in [0, 0.05]$ or $p_i \in [0.95, 1]$.

The problems is solved by solving the equation: $(A^{T}A+lI)p = A^{T}1+(l/2) 1$.

Least squares with regularization: 4.463576e-01


\subsection{e Chebyshev approximation}
$\min \norm{Ap -1}_\infty : 0 \leq p \leq 1$.

Constrained Infinity norm approximation: 4.198242e-01


\subsection{f Exact solution}
Exact solution: 3.574743e-01

\section{Reformulating constraints in cvx}
Each of the following cvx code fragments describes a convex constraint on the scalar variables x, y, and z, but violates the cvx rule set, and so is invalid. Briefly explain why each fragment is invalid. Then, rewrite each one in an equivalent form that conforms to the cvx rule set. In your reformulations, you can use linear equality and inequality constraints, and inequalities constructed using cvx functions.

You can also introduce additional variables, or use LMIs. Be sure to explain (briefly) why your reformulation is equivalent to the original constraint, if it is not obvious.

Check your reformulations by creating a small problem that includes these constraints, and solving it using cvx. Your test problem doesn’t have to be feasible; it’s enough to verify that cvx processes your constraints without error.

Hint. You will definitely want to have Appendix B from the CVX User’s Guide handy while you do this problem. In fact, it will help to read it before you begin. In particular, learn about the functions that end in \_pos, such as square\_pos.
Remark. This looks like a problem about ‘how to use cvx software’, or ‘tricks for using cvx’. But it
really checks whether you understand the various composition rules, convex analysis, and constraint
reformulation rules.

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(a) norm( [ x + 2*y , x - y ] ) == 0
Invalid constraint: {convex} == {constant}
Fix: [x + 2*y , x - y] == [0, 0]
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(b) square( square( x + y ) ) <= x - y
    Illegal operation: square( {convex} ).
Square is not monotonic.
Fix:
square_pos( square( x + y ) ) <= x - y
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(c) 1/x + 1/y <= 1; x >= 0; y >= 0;
    Cannot perform the operation: 
    {positive constant} ./ {real affine}
Fix:
inv_pos(x) + inv_pos(y) <=1; x >= 0; y >= 0;
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(d) norm([ max( x , 1 ) , max( y , 2 ) ]) <= 3*x + y
    Cannot perform the operation norm( {convex}, 2 )
Fix:
    variable x1;
    variable y2;
    
    max( x , 1 ) <= x1;
    max( y , 2 ) <= y2;
    norm([x1, y2]) <= 3*x + y;
\end{verbatim}
Above, we assume that the objective is altered to minimize x1 and y2 too.

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(e) x*y >= 1; x >= 0; y >= 0;
    Invalid quadratic form(s): not a square.
Fix:
x >= inv_pos(y); x >= 0; y >= 0;
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(f) ( x + y )^2 / sqrt( y ) <= x - y + 5
    Cannot perform the operation: {convex} ./ {concave}
Fix:

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(g) x^3 + y^3 <= 1; x>=0; y>=0;
    Illegal operation: {real affine} .^ {3}
    (Consider POW_P, POW_POS, or POW_ABS instead.)
Fix:
pow_pos(x,3) + pow_pos(y,3) <= 1; x>=0; y>=0;
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{}
\begin{verbatim}
(h) x+z <= 1+sqrt(x*y-z^2); x>=0; y>=0;
    Invalid quadratic form(s): not a square.
Fix:
A = [x z; z y];
x+z - det_rootn(A)<= 1; x>=0; y>=0;
\end{verbatim}
