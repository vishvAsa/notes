## Display screens
Liquid Crystal displays tend to be more ergonomically friendly than CRT tube monitors.

### Quality
#### Image quality
Display screens vary in image quality parameters: screen size, maximum resolution: SVGA (800 x 600), XGA (1024 x 768), SXGA (1280 x 1024), or UXGA (1600 x 1200), contrast ratio.

They also vary in refresh rate, in the case of images generated from projection, as in CRT monitors or projectors: low refresh rate results in flicker and eye strain - especially from typing distance. Higher resolutions require correspondingly higher refresh rates.

#### LCD screens
In addition LCD screens vary in adjustibility of height, orientation etc. and whether they also function as a touch sensitive input device. Screen size of around 14' has been quite adequate in my laptop computer.

#### Best and economical
23 inch LCD without touch sensitivity was available for around 110\\\( in a sale.

## Projectors
Using projectors for display allows display size to be set dynamically; allowing a variety of postures and ability to view from a distance, it may be ergonomically better. But, it is not suitable for close viewing (and there fore use as a second monitor), because of the flickering in the display.

### Quality
Besides image quality parameters described in the Display screens section, Projectors vary in portability, the noise they make while operating due to cooling needs, the brightness of the image, lamp life, energy consumption.

### Best and economical
Image brightness of atleast 1400 is good (2300 was tested successfully). Lamp life should be atleast 2000 lumens.

For 340\\\), good projectors are available.

## Adjustment
- Brightness shouldn’t be lighter or darker than your surroundings.
- Lower color temperature - less blue light, which is linked to more eyestrain.
- Raise the device’s refresh rate. That will cause less flickering of the screen.
