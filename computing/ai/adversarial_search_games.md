The game tree: max and min levels. Utility functions and evaluation functions to approximate utility. Labelling the nodes with utilities.

## Minmax algorithm
\\(\alpha \beta\\) pruning : visit nodes only to decide the best move. Games against nature: Expectiminimax algorithm.

The horizon effect: exploring some branches more deeply.
