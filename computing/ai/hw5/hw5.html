Homework Assignment #5: Probabilistic Reasoning and Decision Theory<br>
Due: November 28, 2007
</font></font></h3><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"><br> </font><p>

</p><ol>

<font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"><li> (30%) Consider the application of the Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm to a Bayesian network. <br>
<p>

</p><ol>

<li> Recall that the <b>Markov blanket</b> of a variable in a Bayesian
network is the set that includes the variable's parents, children, and
children's parents. 
Derive Equation 14.11 from the textbook.  That is, show that the
probability of a variable given its Markov blanket
is proportional to the probability of the variable given its parents
times the probability of each child given its respective parents:<br>

<p>

</p></li><li> Now, consider the following network, where the variables are all
binary:<br>
<p>

</p><center><img src="hw5_files/fig5x1b.jpg" width="120"></center><br>
<p>

<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are both uniformly distributed, and <i>Z</i>
is the deterministic exclusive or of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.  
Show that running MCMC on this structure
with the evidence <i>z=1</i> will estimate <i>P(x=1|z=1)</i> as either 1 or 0.
Why does this happen?

</p></li><li> What will happen if we make <i>Z</i> a slightly noisy exclusive or of
its parents? That is, with some small probability <i>q</i>, <i>Z</i> is chosen at
random with uniform distribution regardless of the values of <i>X</i> and
<i>Y</i>, and with probability <i>1-q</i>, <i>Z</i> is the exclusive or of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.
What can you conclude about problems that MCMC can encounter
in its attempts to do a random walk?

</li></ol>
<p>

</p></li><li> (25%) It has sometimes been suggested that <b>lexicographic
preference</b> is a form of rational behavior that is not captured by
utility theory.  Lexicographic preferences rank attributes in some
order X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub>, and treat each attribute as
infinitely more important than attributes later in the order.
In choosing between two prizes, the value of attribute X<sub>i</sub>
only matters if the prizes have the same values for
X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>i-1</sub>.  In a lottery, an infinitesimal
probability of a tiny improvement in a more important attribute is
considered better than a dead certainty of a huge improvement in a less
important attribute. <p>

</p><ol>
  <li>Give a precise definition of lexicographic preference between
  deterministic outcomes. <p>

  </p></li><li>Give a precise definition of lexicographic preference between
  lotteries. <p>

  </p></li><li>Does lexicographic preference violate any of the axioms of
  utility theory?  If so, give an example. <p>

  </p></li><li>Suggest a set of attributes for which you might exhibit
  lexicographic preference. <p>
</p></li></ol> <p>


</p></li><li> (30%)
An engineer responsible for a new product development for a computer
manufacturer must decide whether to develop or drop a new modem
interface.  The prior probability of success is .60 if the device is
developed, in which case company profits are expected to increase by
$1,000,000 over the lifetime of the product (this expected profit is 
<i>after</i> deducting all associated costs, including development
costs!).  If the device fails to catch on, development costs of
$200,000 will be lost.
No direct costs have yet been incurred for the device. <p>

</p><ol>

<li> Compute the expected monetary value (EMV) of each action. <p>

</p></li><li> Compute the value of perfect information (VPI).  What is the most
the engineer would pay for information that would predict the success or
failure of the modem interface? <p>

</p></li><li> Suppose that a panel of potential users can evaluate a mock-up
device and simulation.  The panel consensus will be to dislike the
device, have mixed opinions, or like it.  Previous testing has
established probabilities for these respective outcomes of .10, .30, and
.60 given that the test item becomes successful and .80, .15, and .05
given that it fails.  The cost of the test is $30,000.  Construct the
engineer's decision tree showing all choices and possible outcomes.
<p>

</p></li><li> Add all the corresponding probabilities to the branches of the
decision tree. <p>

</p></li><li> Evaluate your decision tree and find which course of action
maximizes the expected profit. <p>

</p></li></ol> <p>

</p></li><li> (15%) Prove that the value of information, as defined in class, is
nonnegative.  How do you explain the fact that in practice too much
information can lead to deterioration in decision quality? <br>
<p>

</p></li><li> (optional)
Suppose you are a company bidding on a DOD contract. Assume you will get
the contract if your bid b is lower than your competitors' lowest
bid l. Your costs to carry out the contract if you win it will be
c, resulting in net profit b-c. If your bid is not lowest, your
profit from sitting around doing nothing is 0. The problem is that c and l
are unknown. Our prior probability distributions are that c is
uniformly distributed between $0 and $1 million, and l is uniformly
distributed between $0 and $2 million. <p>

</p><ol>

<li> Write down your expected profit as a function of b only, given
these priors.

</li><li> Figure out the best bid to make, and show it yields an expected
profit of $281,250.

</li><li> Now assume you can hire a management consultant who can figure
out an exact value for your costs c. Supposing you had this
information, write down an expression for the expected profit in terms
of b and c only, and figure out the best bid as a function of c.
From this, calculate the expected profit from the best bid, again in
terms of c.

</li><li> Using the prior distribution for c, figure out how much you
would expect to make if you had exact information about c, and hence that
the management consultant is worth <i>at most</i> slightly over $10,000.

</li><li> Repeat the exercise for a "consultant" who can provide exact
information about the competitors' lowest bid l. 
Draw conclusions.

</li><li> Repeat the exercise for the case in which you hire both
consultants before bidding. Does the value of information add up?
Would you expect it to?
