  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> (12%) Consider the following game tree in which the static
heuristic scores are given for all the tip nodes. </font>

      <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> What move should MAX choose?

        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> Which nodes would not need to be examined using the alpha-beta
algorithm -- assuming that nodes are examined in left-to-right order?

        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> What changes of values assigned to the leaves are necessary so that
the maximum amount of prunning will occur?  How many additional nodes
would be pruned this way?

        </font></li>
    </ol>
    <font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> </font>
    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> (20%) Consider the following procedure for
choosing moves in games with chance nodes:

    </font>
    <ol>


      <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> Generate a suitable (say, 200) dice-roll sequences down to a
suitable depth (say, 8).

        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> With known die rolls, the game tree becomes deterministic.  For
each die-roll sequence, solve the resulting deterministic game tree
using alpha-beta.

        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> Use the results to estimate the value of each top-level move and choose the
best one.

        </font></li>
    </ol>


    <font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica">Will this procedure work correctly?  Why (not)?<br>

    </font>
    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> (16%) Suppose we play a variant of Tic-Tac-Toe in which each player
sees only his or her own moves.  If the player makes a move on a square
occupied by an opponent, the board "beeps" and the player gets another
try.  Would the backgammon model (the EXPECTIMAX-EXPECTIMIN algorithm
described in Section 5.5) suffice for this game, or would we need
something more sophisticated?  Why? <br>

    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> (20%) Knowledge representation in first-order logic. Represent the
following sentences in first-order logic, using a consistent vocabulary
(which you must define):

    </font>
    <ol>

      <font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica">  <li> The best score in CS683 is always higher than the best score in
  CS610.
  </li>
      <li> No one in this neighborhood buys flood insurance.
  </li>
      <li> None of the President's aides has issued this statement.
  </li>
      <li> The President's aides issued conflicting statements.
  </li>
      <li> Politicians can fool some of the people all the time, and they
  can fool all the people some of the time, but they can't fool all of
  the people all of the time.
      </li>
      </font>
    </ol>
    <font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> </font>
    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> (16%) Backward-chaining inference.  Consider the following set of
Horn sentences:<br>


    </font>
    <p></p>
    <ul>

      <font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica">&#8704;x,y,z Greater(x,y) &#8743; Greater(y,z) &#8658; Greater(x,z) <br>

  <li><font face="Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"> (16%) If a course is easy, some students are happy.  If a course has a
final, no students are happy.  Use resolution to show that, if a course
has a final, the course is not easy. </font>
