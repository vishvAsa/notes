  <li><big>(12%) Iterative lengthening search is an iterative analogue
of uniform-cost search. The basic idea is to use
increasing limits on path cost. If a node is generated whose path cost
exceeds the current limit, it is immediately discarded. For each new
iteration, the limit is set to the lowest path cost of any node
discarded in the previous iteration.
    
    </big>
    <ol>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (3%) Show that this algorithm is optimal for general
path costs.</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ol>
        <big>


      
      </big>
      </ol>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>Suppose that N is
the set of all nodes which are in the explored part of the search tree.
(Every node belonging to the explored part of the search tree has
undergone the "goal test".) Also, let NF stand for the set of all nodes
in the fringe of the explored part of the search tree.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>Initially,&nbsp;N
and NF
consist of only the node corresponding to the initial state. Initially,
the limit used by iterative lengthening is 0.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>Each successive
iteration of
Iterative lengthening works by generating all the successors of the
fringe nodes, and discarding all nodes which exceed the current limit.
Amongst those nodes which are discarded, the lowest path cost is set to
be the limit used by iterative lengthening during the next iteration.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>So, if the search
progresses by
one more iteration, N grows by the addition of the nodes with the least
path cost, from amongst all the nodes which do not already belong to
N.&nbsp;Thus, all nodes which are not part of N have a path cost
greater than the maximum path cost for the nodes belonging to N.
[Observation 1.1.1]</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>During each
iteration of the
algorithm, N grows by exactly by the number of nodes whose path cost
equals the limit for the iteration. These nodes undergo the goal test.
If one of these nodes is identified as a "goal node", the algorithm
halts. So, whenever the algorithm proceeds to another iteration, it is
implied that all nodes which have been previously added to N have
undergone the goal test, and they are known to be non-goal
nodes.&nbsp;[Observation 1.1.2]</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">Now,
suppose that during some search iteration, the goal node is found.
Considering [Observation 1.1.2] and [Observation
1.1.1], there does not exist another goal node with a lower path cost -
because, if there were such a node, it would be part of N, and the
algorithm would have halted. Hence, the algorithm is optimal.</span></big></li>

      </big>
      </ol>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (4%) Consider a uniform tree with branching factor <i>b</i>,
solution depth <i>d</i>,
and unit step costs (each action costs one unit). How many iterations
will iterative lengthening require?</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>If d=0, then the
initial state
is also the goal state. The limit is initially 0. In the solution
below, in counting the number of iterations required, I count the
iteration described above.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">In
order to find the goal
node, the algorithm, for this problem, will have to undergo d+1
iterations (including the first iteration, where the maximum path cost
is 0).</span></big></li>
        <big>


      
      </big>
      </ul>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (5%) Now consider step costs drawn from the continuous
range [e,1]
for some 0 &lt; e &lt; 1.
How many iterations are required in the <i>worst case</i>?</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>Note that the
question
specifies the lower bound on the step size, e. Then, iterative
lengthening will undergo at most d/e iterations.</big></li>

  <li><big> (12%) Suppose you were doing an A* search and there were a
number of
different ways that you could compute an admissible heuristic value.
Suppose that some were very cheap to compute
but also very inaccurate estimators while others were very expensive to
compute but were very accurate estimators. How would you determine
which computation to use for a given application?<br>



    
    </big>
    <ul>
      <big>


      </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big> There are
limitations on the space and time available to an agent for
computation. This
is especially true where the agent is required to respond in real-time.
In dynamic environments, the situation may change during the time the
agent spends in thought. If, for a given problem, an agent does not
have the luxury computing a complex heuristic without incurring a
penalty, the agent should choose the simple heuristic. Humans, for
example, use simple heuristics in daily life.</big></li>
      <big>


      </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">On the
other hand, if the
agent were dealing with a static envronment, and if the agent had all
the time it needed, it would use the more expensive, but accurate
heuristic in the hopes of safely arriving at the solution faster. This,
of course, assumes that the heuristic function is cheaper to compute
than the problem of exploring the problem search tree directly. (That
is, if the heuristic is not exponential in time.)</span></big></li>
      <big>


      </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>One would consider
the reduction
in the
number of nodes expanded against the computational complexity of the
expensive heuristic. If the more-accurate heuristic is accurate enough
to guarantee subexponential growth in the number of nodes expanded with
comparitively little computational cost, one would choose the more
accurate heuristic. (This happens when the error in the heuristic
function at node n &lt;= O(log( actual cost to get to the goal from
node n)).)</big></li>
      <big>


    
    </big>
    </ul>
    <big>


  </big></li>



  <li><big> (12%) Give an example of a search space in which A* would
generate
a node first with a <i>g</i>-value that is not the
shortest distance
between that node and the initial state. To do that, draw a small
graph, designate one node as an initial state and one node as the goal
state. Assign path costs to edges and an admissible heuristic estimate
to each node.
    
    </big>
    <ol>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (5%) Show the graph and trace the execution of A*
until it terminates.</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul>
        <big>


        </big><li><big>The graph is as follows:<br>

          <big>
          </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>A* generates node B, using the longer, but direct, path. But, B is not expanded.</big></li>
          <big>
          </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>A* generates node C, whose f-value is equal to the F value of B, as generated above.</big></li>
          <big>
          </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>A* arbitrarily chooses to expand node C, and finds a shorter route to node B.</big></li>
          <big>
          </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">In the final step, A* expands node B to arrive at the goal, the node D.</span></big></li>

        <big>


      
      </big>
      </ul>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (4%) Is your heuristic function consistent?
Is it generally possible to create such an example when the heuristic
is
consistent?</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul>
        <big>


        </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">In
case of Consistent or monotonous heuristics, the f-value never
decreases along a path in the search tree.</span></big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">My
heuristic function is
not consisitent. It is not generally possible to create such an example
when the heuristic is consistent. (A proof is not provided, as it was not asked for.)<br>



          </span></big></li>
        <big>


      
      </big>
      </ul>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (3%) In general, will A* still find the optimal
solution when this
happens (i.e., a node is generated with a <i>g</i>-value
greater than
the shortest distance from the initial state)?</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul style="font-style: italic;">
        <big>


        </big><li><big>A* will still find the optimal solution when this
happens!
This happens because the algorithm will faithfully switch to using the
shorter path, if necessary. The optimality of A* has been guaranteed
and proved in the class.</big></li>
        <big>


      
      </big>

  </big></li>



  <li><big> (16%) In this exercise, we consider the choice between two
    <i>admissible</i> heuristic functions, one of which is
always "at least
as accurate" as the other. More precisely, for a fixed goal, let
h<sub>1</sub> and h<sub>2</sub> be two
admissible heuristic functions
such that h<sub>1</sub>(n) &lt;= h<sub>2</sub>(n)
for every node n in
the search tree. <br>



Now recall that the A* algorithm expands nodes according to their f
values, but the order in which nodes of equal f values are expanded can
vary, depending on the implementation. For a given heuristic function
h,
we say that an ordering of the nodes in the search tree is h-legal if
expanding the nodes in that order is consistent with A* search using h.
    <br>



Let N denote the set of nodes expanded by an A* search using h<sub>1</sub>
(the "less accurate" heuristic function). Prove that there is always
some
search ordering that is h<sub>2</sub>-legal that expands
only a (not
necessarily strict) subset of the nodes in N. <br>



That is, prove that it is always <i>possible</i> that h<sub>2</sub>
leads to a
smaller search space than h<sub>1</sub>.
(Note that the question asks you to find <i>some</i>
search ordering such that certain properties hold. Do you
see why it is not possible, in general, to show that these properties
hold for an <i>arbitrary</i> search ordering?)</big></li>



  
  
  <ul style="font-style: italic;">
    <big>


    </big><li><big>Let C = optimum solution path cost. Also, let f1 and f2 be the f values corresponding to h1 and h2.</big></li>
    <big>


    </big><li><big>A* using h2 will never expand more nodes than A* using
h1,
except possibly for some nodes&nbsp;with f(n)=C. This is proved
below.</big></li>
    <big>


    </big><li><big>It was proven in class that every node with f(n)&lt;C
is surely
expanded. In other words, every node with h(n)&lt;C-g(n) is
expanded.</big></li>
    <big>


    </big><li><big>But, as h2 is at least as big as h1 for all nodes, every
node which is surely expanded by h2 is also surely expanded by h1. In
other words, all nodes for which f2&lt;C are definitely expanded by
both heuristics. [Observation 4.1]</big></li>
    <big>
    </big><li><big>But, consider the nodes for whom fn(n)=C. The set of these
nodes will include the goal node, for which g=C and h=0. Let N1=set of
such nodes for h1, and N2= set of such nodes for h2. It follows
directly from the data that all nodes present in N2 are either present
in N1, or f1(n)&lt;C for them.</big></li>
    <big>
    </big><li><big>For nodes present in both N2 and N1, suppose that h1
arbitrarily chooses a node to expand, and that it turns out to be the
goal node. In this case, h1 will immediately terminate.  Also suppose
that h2 were to expand the goal node only after it expanded every node
present in N2. In this case, h2 will have expanded nodes which h1 did
not have to expand!&nbsp;[Observation 4.2]</big></li>
    <big>
    </big><li><big>But, if both h2 and h1 were to follow the same ordering of
nodes to expand when fn(n)=C for both heuristics, we can say that every
node, for which f2(n)=C, which expanded by h2 is also expanded by
h1.&nbsp;[Observation 4.3]</big></li>
    <big>
    </big><li><big>So, from [Observation 4.1]
and&nbsp;[Observation 4.3], we
conclude that for some search ordering, the set of nodes expanded by h2
is a subset of the set of nodes expanded by h1. Also,
from&nbsp;[Observation 4.2], we see that this does not hold for any
arbitrary ordering.</big></li>

  <li><big> (24%) A knight moves on a chessboard two squares up, down,
left, or
right followed by one square in one of the two directions perpendicular
to the first part of the move (i.e., the move is L-shaped). Suppose the
knight is on an unbounded board at square (0,0) and we wish to move it
to square (x,y) in the smallest number of moves. (For example, to move
from (0,0) to (1,1) requires two moves.)
    
    </big>
    <ol>
      <big>


      </big><li><big> (4%) Explain how to decide whether the required number
of moves is even
or odd without constructing a solution.</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul style="font-style: italic;">
        <big>


        </big><li><big>Consider a knight at the position (0,0). Suppose that
the knight wanted to move either to (1,0) or to (0,1). This can be
accomplished with 3 moves.
Suppose instead that the knight wanted to move to (1,1). This can be
accomplished with 2 moves. Suppose instead that
the knight wanted to move to (1,2). This can be accomplished with 1
move.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li><big>From
the above observations, we make the following generalization: If a
"target square" can be reached from the origin-square by only making
diagonal moves of arbitrary length and direction, then, a knight
starting from the origin-square will be able to reach the "target
square" using
an even number of moves. Otherwise, the knight will only be able to
reach the target square using an odd number of moves.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li><big>A proof of the above
generalization is outlined here (A rigorous proof is not provided, as
it was not asked for.): Color the unbounded chessboard such that all
diagonally connected squares share the same color. An inescapable
property of a knight's movement is that the "color" of its square
changes with each move. Using this property, it may be proved by
induction that to reach a square of the same color, a knight has to
undertake an even number of moves, and to reach a square of the
opposite color, the knight has to undertake an odd number of moves.</big></li>
        <big>


      
      </big>
      </ul>
      <big>


      </big><li><big>(6%) Design an admissible heuristic function for
estimating the minimum
number of moves required; it should be as accurate as you can make it.
Prove rigorously that your heuristic is admissible.</big></li>
      <big>


      
      </big>
      <ul>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>I define the term
"hvd distance from A to B" to mean
the number of moves required by a King (a chess piece which can move
diagonally, vertically or horizontally one square in any
direction)&nbsp;to reach square A from square B. Consider all the
squares surrounding a square (x,y), such that they fall within a hvd
distance of 2. There are 9 such squares (including the
original square).</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>The heuristic
algorithm computes the hvd distance
from the origin square to the target square. It then divides this
number by 2 and rounds it off to the next highest natural number, to
arrive at a number called "the ring ordinal". If the&nbsp;"the ring
ordinal" is
odd, but the expected actual number of moves is even, (or vice versa)
the "ring ordinal" is incremented by 1. The value of the heuristic is
the "ring ordinal" we finally reach. (One can decide whether even or
odd number of moves are required for reaching the target square by
using the reasoning provided in answer to the question 5.1.)</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>Rigorous proof of
admissibility:</big></li>
        <big>


        
        </big>
        <ul>
          <big>


          </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>It immediately
follows from the definition of the
knight's move that a knight cannot travel more than 2 hvd distance
units per move. So, at maximum, the knight can reach a square 2*"number
of knight-moves" away in terms of hvd distance. In other words, "hvd
distance" &lt;= 2*"number
of knight-moves".</big></li>
          <big>


          </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>From the above
observation, it follows that
ceil("hvd distance"/2) cannot be greater than the number of moves
required by the knight.&nbsp;ceil("hvd distance"/2)
represents the real number&nbsp;"hvd distance"/2
rounded off to the next highest natural number.</big></li>
          <big>


          </big><li style="font-style: italic;"><big>But, if one were
to observe that&nbsp;ceil("hvd distance"/2), the lower bound on
the number of knight-moves required, is odd, but knows that an even
number of moves are required (as deduced using the
reasoning provided in answer to the question 5.1.), one can safely
increment the lower bound to&nbsp;ceil("hvd distance"/2)
+1, with the guarantee
that admissibility is maintained. This conclusion follows from the
facts mentioned in the antecedent of the above sentence. One may
similarly prove that&nbsp;ceil("hvd distance"/2)
+1 remains admissible in the case where ceil("hvd distance"/2)
is even and the number of knight-moves required is known to be odd.</big></li>
          <big>


          </big><li><big><span style="font-style: italic;">Hence,
we claim that the heuristic described has been proved.</span></big></li>

  <li><big> (24%) The traveling salesperson problem (TSP) can be
solved via
the minimum spanning tree (MST) heuristic, which is used to estimate
the
cost of completing the tour, given that a partial tour has already been
constructed. The MST cost of a set of cities is the smallest sum of the
link costs of any tree that connects all the cities.

the TSP.</big></li>

        <big>


        </big><li><big>States: Each state corresponds to the path traced by
the
travelling salesperson so far. It is a sequence of verteces V eg:
&lt;v1, v4, v5, v2&gt;. The verteces are numbered v1 to vx,
where x is
the number of verteces. The cost of the edge between any pair of
verteces is known. Valid
states do not contain repeated verteces, except when the circuit represented
by the state contains all verteces.</big></li>
        <big>


        </big><li><big>Initial state: The
salesperson has not visited any vertex.</big></li>
        <big>

through all the nodes. The optimal goal state corresponds to the
minimum cost circuit which can be traced by the salesperson.</big></li>

          </big><li><big>Suppose that N is the set of all cities. Suppose that the
set G is the set of all cities which are part of a partially completed
tour, which ends at node A and begins at O. The TSP problem, at each
stage of the construction of the tour, would be to start from A and
return to O after touring all nodes in N-G, with the minimum path-cost.
This is the problem the salesperson has to face at each stage of the
construction of the tour. We will relax this problem to obtain the MST
heuristic.</big></li>
          <big>
          </big><li><big>Suppose that instead of having to find a tour through the
cities in the set N-G to O, the salesperson were to find a minimum
spanning tree through those nodes. By definition, a relaxed problem has
fewer and/or relaxed constraints when compared with the original
problem. Here we relax the original problem by asking the salesperson
to find a MST through the cities, rather than asking him to find a
*minimal path* through those nodes. (A path is a special kind of tree.)
Hence, by virtue of relaxing the constraints on the TSP, we have
arrived at the MST heuristic.</big></li>
