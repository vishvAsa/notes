\title{Verification and validation: Quick reference}
\author{vishvAs vAsuki}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Mainly from Alan Cline's handouts.

\part{Notation}
S, $S_{i}$, $S_{i};S_{j}$: Pieces of code.

\part{Themes}
\section{Validation}
Are we trying to make the right thing? Are we solving the right equation?

\section{Verification}
Have we made what we were trying to make? Are there errors in our implementation of the model?

\part{Reasoning about programs}
Also see distributed computing ref.

\section{Correctness}
\subsection{Assertion}
Assertion p: Assume that p is true.

In practice, good programmers use special statements to check if assertions are true; eg: Java.

\subsection{Correctness}
S is correct wrt precondition p and postcondition q if: starting with p true, run S, get q.

\subsection{Partial correctness}
$\set{p}S\set{q}$. S is correct wrt p and q if: starting with p true, if ye run S, ye get q if S terminates. This is useful notation for proving correctness of program segments.

\subsubsection{Axioms}
[Hoare] F indicates set of empty set of states (unreachable); so: \\
$\forall q, S:: F S \set{q}$; $\set{p}S F \implies \lnot p $: if S results in unreachable state, initial state itself must have been unreachable.

$\set{p_{1}} S_{1}\set{p_{2}}\land \set{p_{2}} S_{2} \set{p_{3}} \implies \set{p_{1}}S_{1};S_{2}\set{p_{3}}$.

\section{Verification with forward chaining}
\subsection{Picking invariants}
During verification, select invariant weak enough to remain true before and after loop is executed, also strong enough to lead to the required postcondition: necessary to ensure postcondition even if loop not entered.

\subsection{Translate program into hoare triples}
If S = if cond then $S_{1}$ else $S_{2}$: $(\set{p \land cond} S_{1} \set{q})\land (\set{p \land 
 \lnot cond} S_{2} \set{q})$.

Iteration: S = while cond do S', $q = (p \land \lnot cond)$: $(\set{p \land cond} S \set{p})$: p is the loop invariant; cond is loop variant. p can be false during loop execution, but returns to true in the end.

Assignment: $\set{p(x)} x \dfn E \set{p(E)}$.


\section{Verification with preconditions}
Aka back substitution. This is backward chaining.

\subsection{Weakest preconditions for program S, postcondition q}
p = wp(S,q). Weakest assertion p: $\set{p} S \set{q}$. For any r : if $\set{r} S \set{q}$ $\land$ S terminates; $r \implies wp(S,q)$. Converse is true.

So, use this if you want to show that $\set{r} S \set{q}$ (like $\set{r} x \assign 5 \set{x\geq5}$): take q, substitute the effects of S in q, thence get wp(S, q); show $r \implies wp(S, q)$!

$wp(S_{1};S_{2}, q) = wp(S_{1}, wp(S_{2},q))$.

wp(if cond then S; q) = $(cond \implies wp(S,q)) \land (\lnot cond \implies q)$.

$wp(x \dfn E, q(x))$ = E is defined, q(E) true.
