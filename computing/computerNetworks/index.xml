      <description>Given a computer network, suppose that we want to get any $k$ given computers to communicate accurately and easily in order to provide a variety of services to the users. This involves many common/ separate tasks which can be implemented as separate modules, which inturn can be arranged as a stack or hierarchy of layers. For details, see software architecture survey.
Common layers are described below, with TCP/IP protocol stack as a specific common instantiation, which dominated other standards due to it being open-source.</description>
