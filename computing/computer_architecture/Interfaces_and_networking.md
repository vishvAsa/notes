## Device interfaces
Common standards are often used to connect a wide variety of device pairs.

### Universal serial bus
USB is currently most popular. USB 3 enables superior data-transfer speeds.

USB allows for a tiered star topology: so one can connect many devices to a particular device with a single usb wire branching out into many others. Power dissipation limits the extant to which this can be done.

### USB Plugs
USB wires have 4 (sometimes 5) terminals arranged in various shapes.

Type A is most common.

Micro B is a small trapezoid - often used with pocket computers.

Mini A and B are also sometimes used.

Type B is used with monitors.


## Modems
Modems provide a link to a wider network - usually the Internet. They differ based on the means of communication used in providing this link, and the links it can provide to devices seeking connection to the wider network.

### Mobile Wifi (MiFi)
These connect to the wider network using 3G or 4G compatible protocols; and allow devices to connect to it using WiFi protocol - for which reason, they are called 'hotspots'.
