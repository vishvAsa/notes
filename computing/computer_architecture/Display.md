## GPU
-  nVidia GP107 [GeForce GTX 1050] - DP 1.43, HDMI 2.0b, Dual Link-DVI

## Display screens
Liquid Crystal displays tend to be more ergonomically friendly than CRT tube monitors.

### Quality
#### Image quality
Display screens vary in image quality parameters: screen size, maximum resolution: SVGA (800 x 600), XGA (1024 x 768), SXGA (1280 x 1024), or UXGA (1600 x 1200), contrast ratio.

#### Refresh rate
They also vary in refresh rate, in the case of images generated from projection, as in CRT monitors or projectors: low refresh rate results in flicker and eye strain - especially from typing distance. Higher resolutions require correspondingly higher refresh rates.

Some ad fraud: "75hz is only on 1280x720 resolution, so viewsonic is lying about 75hz."

#### LCD screens
In addition LCD screens vary in adjustibility of height, orientation etc. and whether they also function as a touch sensitive input device. 

First, screen size of around 14' has been quite adequate for laptop use. Later, external monitor became indispensable.

#### Borders and mounts
Borderless monitors may be useful for stacking.

100x100 VESA mount is common.

#### Response time
Short response time (1ms) is useful for gaming. 5ms is common.

##### Bleed
IPS panel - some glow and backlight bleeding is common.

#### Ports
Cheap monitors come with fewer or obsolete ports.

#### Best and economical
24 inch LCD without touch sensitivity was available for around 110 USD in a sale.

## Projectors
Using projectors for display allows display size to be set dynamically; allowing a variety of postures and ability to view from a distance, it may be ergonomically better. But, it is not suitable for close viewing (and there fore use as a second monitor), because of the flickering in the display.

### Quality
Besides image quality parameters described in the Display screens section, Projectors vary in portability, the noise they make while operating due to cooling needs, the brightness of the image, lamp life, energy consumption.

### Best and economical
Image brightness of atleast 1400 is good (2300 was tested successfully). Lamp life should be atleast 2000 lumens.

## Adjustment
- Raise the contrast on your screen.
- Brightness shouldn’t be lighter or darker than your surroundings.
- Lower color temperature - less blue light, which is linked to more eyestrain.
- Raise the device’s refresh rate. That will cause less flickering of the screen.

### Gamma
Too low means you can't make out greys on a black background. Too high means you can't make out greys on a white background. 1.64 seems to provide a good balance.

### Dark vs light themes 
- Black text on a white background is the best. This comes down to the properties of color, light, and the human iris. White essentially reflects every wavelength in the color spectrum, which means our irises don’t need to open wide to absorb enough light, leaving them in their natural shape.
- Dark themes can put more strain on your eyes in high-light conditions, since it washes out the text. 100% contrast (white text on a black background) is typically harder to read and may cause more eye strain. Dark themes can reduce eye strain in low-light conditions (night-time or dimmer workspaces). 
- Try to control your screen brightness and your ambient light situation instead of changing the colors.
