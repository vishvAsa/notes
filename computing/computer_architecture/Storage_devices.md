## Magnetic storage
Unlike optical storage, magnetic storage is re-writable.

### Bus interface
While SCSI has a processor integrated into the controller, SATA makes greater use of the system processor to serve that function; the former is costlier.

### Quality
Hard disk drives differ mainly in speed, storage capacity, size, redundancy (RAID), error correction, shock resistance.

#### Best and economical
Areal density doubling every two to four years since their invention. So, even 1TB is economical.

## Optical storage
They are compact, but have the disadvantage of being over-writable a limited number of times.

### Quality
#### Best and economical
Blu-Ray - where blue laser is used - is the rage. It is even more burdened than the DVD with copy-protection mechanisms like region code and DRM.

## Flash memory
These use floating gate MOSFET transistors. They are fast and compact.

### SD cards
#### Size
They come in 3 sizes: micro, mini and regular. A smaller card can be used in place of a larger card using an adapter.

#### Speed
Depending on transfer speed (in MBps), they are classified into various classes, with class 4 commonly used. Class 10 is recommended for watching movies etc..
