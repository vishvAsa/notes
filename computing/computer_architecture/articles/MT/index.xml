      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an old rUs book (translated into English) I learnt of two remarkable Russian engineers who invented analog computers that were critical for the success of the Soviet rUs empire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first of these was Alexei Krylov who built a mechanical computer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His successor was Vladimir Lukyanov who built the first water computer using water flowing through tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The final models of this were so accurate that they were not beaten by digital computers until the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
