Architecture considers how code may be organized.


## The overall picture

Programming is a matter of unambiguously telling the computer what to do, in a language it understands.

### Analogies
Programming is analogous to wiring a complicated electronic circuit: Joining wires of various modules is the right way.

Programming is analogous to designing a pipeline or circuit on the computer (as in chip design or in designers like rational rose, or in rapidminer or in lego robotics).
