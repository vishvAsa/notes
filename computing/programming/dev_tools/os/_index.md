## Operating system strategy
- Arch Linux given the continuous update model.
  - This periodically causes problems - GUI may not function. 

### Redundancy
- Hence some redundancy in terms of display managers installed - GDM, LXDM, SDDM.
- Further, redundancy is desired for desktop environments.
  - Current favorites list: Cinnamon, Deepin, Bludgie
- Similar redundancy is desired for important tools such as editors.

## Virtual machines, emulators
An emulator provides the same interface as another operating system to some application. A virtual machine simulates computer hardware.

### Emulators on linux
WINE emulates windows.

mono emulates standardized part of the .Net framework. Command: mono something.exe.
