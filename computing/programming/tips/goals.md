title: Goals

## Overview
In roughly descending order of importance:

- Easy to understand.
- Easy to modify.
- Few errors.
- High coding speed.
- High computational efficiency.

## Understanding specifications

In the industry, this involves surveying customers, rapid prototyping, talking to end-users etc.. In research, the specifications come from the research problem.

## Complexity

More complex code is harder to implement : sometimes, there one can make choices which lead to simpler code - by simplifying requirements or interface languages for example.

#### Cyclostomic complexity

This is the number of edges in a representation of a program as a flow chart. The more conditional and looping statements there are, the greater the cyclostomic complexity.

## UI Goals

### Right mental model
Let users get the right mental model to operate the machine as easily as possible.

Mental model factors

- Affordances
- Restrictions
- Causalities
- Mapping
- Transfer effects
- Stereotypes, cultural standards and habits
- Instructions

#### Target user

Design to cover > 0.95 of users.

Design for extremes - designing for 'average user' is wrong.
