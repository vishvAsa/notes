Let us say "high" IQ is about >=135, probably the minimum IQ needed to be an effective scientist (I don't believe Feynman/Wilson' s self-reported IQs) then 2 tend to be positively correlated, i'd hazard with a r^2 \approx 0.6 or so. Of course, there is something like a virtuoso programmer, just like there is a virtuoso cricketer or artist or writer. This is not purely a function of raw IQ, i.e., any given person with a high IQ will not necessarily be a virtuoso programmer, though the converse linkage is much stronger. 

It seems that such programming virtuosity often needs a greater alignment of the vectors of verbal & math IQs. While verbal & math IQ are correlated the angle between these vectors is not 0 in any given person; thus some are more verbally talented & some more in math. Higher programming needs a grasp of math concepts, but it also has parallels to writing poetry /good prose. That latter capacity closely parallels what the old H thinkers termed kavitvam. So the closest analog of a great modern programmer was an old Sanskritic kavi with the full range of kavitvam, i.e., like bhAskara-II.
