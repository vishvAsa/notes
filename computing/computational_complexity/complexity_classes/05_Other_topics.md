## Explore further
Interactive proofs. Transperent proofs: a small error shows up every where - make combinations of atomic results.

## Lower bounds
Crossing sequence: an important trick. \tbc Adverserial technique: Let adversary make an alg, you make an input to screw it up. \tbc Use information theory. Reduce to other hard problems. Construct input for which minimum processing is required.

\\(P \neq NP\\) proof is hard: natural proofs (satisfy constructivity and largeness) won't work: else you'll end up with an alg =f(proof) to solve NP prob in Poly time. \why

## Problems
### Graph Problems
Graph G.

NP complete: Is S the largest independent set in G? Does there exist a route for the travelling salesman in G, of cost c? Graph Isomorphism (G1, G2). Is G 3-colorable?

Connectivity (G, u, v).

### SAT Problems
TMSAT: (TM string M, input x, time limit) \\(|\\) M accepts (x, u) with cert u. SAT: satisfiable (cnf). 3-SAT: satisfiable (3-cnf). UNSAT: unsatisfiable (b). Diophontine equations (Polynomial eqns with integer coeff) has integer solns?. Subset sum: (S,n). Linear programming (Soln to linear inequalities). Integer programming (Find integer soln).

### Number Theory problems
Factoring(n). IsPrime(n).
