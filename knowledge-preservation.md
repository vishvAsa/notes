## Post-industrial age
The post-oil, post-industrial-age world will arrive (details [TM](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m)), with much unrest, by 2160 (or 2260 if ice-methane extraction works out). Lack of fertilizers will lead to famine and a big drop in population. Raw materials like plastics, copper, and lithium too will be rarer. Machines - let alone computers - will be scarce. So, electronic data will be ephemeral.+++(5)+++ 

How then to best perserve our knowledge (physical and spiritual) and texts?

## Media

Lists of oldest surviving documents - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_documents)

### 3k+ yr
#### Clay tablets
Babylonian clay tablets have survived from 4000 BCE (=7k years). But they are fragile - and need to be preserved.

#### Stone
Stone tablets survive from 3500 BCE.

Is there an automated rock engraver - to engrave given text into a rock slab?? (analogous to CNC on metal https://youtube.com/watch?v=SdSVMygb450 ) Want to preserve important knowledge.

#### Religious oral tradition
Eg. Vedas.

#### Metal plates
Metal plates risk being stolen, melted and reused in a metal-scarce world.

Metal engraving is relatively easy with a CNC machine. 

#### Metal grammaphone records
Can even record sound for grammaphone.  

Voyager golden record - copper disk 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter plated first with nickel and then gold. The record's cover is aluminum and electroplated upon it is an ultra-pure sample of the isotope uranium-238. Expected to remain intelligible for more than a billion years in sterile space.

### .5-1k yr
#### Waferfiche

Needs only a magnifying glass to read.

#### Archival DVDs
- 1000 Years Archival Hitachi/LG Digital Storage Blank M-Disc DVD+R | 4.7GB | 3 Pack Jewel Case

#### Palm leaf / birch manuscripts
Last few decades to 600 years, depending on local climatic conditions.

### .1k-.3k yr
#### Archival paper
Archival paper has low acid.

#### Common paper
Paper, having acid, degrades over time. 

### .01k yr

#### Shellac records
Quite brittle.

#### Vinyl records
Last 100 yrs under good conditions.

## Retrieval/ playback
Grammaphone doesn't require electricity to play sound. It's relatively easy to construct.
