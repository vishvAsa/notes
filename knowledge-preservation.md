**How to best preserve our knowledge (physical and spiritual) and texts?**

## Post-industrial age
The post-oil, post-industrial-age world will arrive (details [TM](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9js5291m)), with much unrest, by 2160 (or 2260 if ice-methane extraction works out). Lack of fertilizers will lead to famine and a big drop in population. Raw materials like plastics, copper, and lithium too will be rarer. Machines - let alone computers - will be scarce. So, electronic data will be ephemeral.+++(5)+++ 

(Even while the industrial age is going strong, 38% of web-pages from 2013 was not accessible anymore in 2024. [PR](pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/))

**How then to best preserve our knowledge (physical and spiritual) and texts?**

## Preservation need
### Texts
Human brain is limited - so rAmANuja had to trek all the way to kAshmIr to consult bodhAyana-vRtti, deshika had to carry a big trunk of palm leaves to save shruta-prakAshika etc.. Even a text published by so famous a person as uttamUru-svAmI 50 years ago is very hard to find.

## Media

Lists of oldest surviving documents - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_documents)

### 3k+ yr
#### Clay tablets
Babylonian clay tablets have survived from 4000 BCE (=7k years). But they are fragile - and need to be preserved.

#### Stone
Stone tablets survive from 3500 BCE.

Is there an automated rock engraver - to engrave given text into a rock slab?? (analogous to CNC on metal https://youtube.com/watch?v=SdSVMygb450 ) Want to preserve important knowledge.

#### Religious oral tradition
Eg. Vedas.

#### Metal plates
Metal plates risk being stolen, melted and reused in a metal-scarce world.

Metal engraving is relatively easy with a CNC machine. 

#### Metal grammaphone records
Can even record sound for grammaphone.  

Voyager golden record - copper disk 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter plated first with nickel and then gold. The record's cover is aluminum and electroplated upon it is an ultra-pure sample of the isotope uranium-238. Expected to remain intelligible for more than a billion years in sterile space.

### .5-1k yr
#### Waferfiche

Needs only a magnifying glass to read.

#### Archival DVDs
- 1000 Years Archival Hitachi/LG Digital Storage Blank M-Disc DVD+R | 4.7GB | 3 Pack Jewel Case

#### Palm leaf / birch manuscripts
Last few decades to 600 years, depending on local climatic conditions.

#### Microfilms
polyester based microfilm - .1-.5k yrs. Used for storing newspapers.

### .1k-.3k yr
#### Museium grade paper
Curators love these papers because they’re made of 100% cotton rag and have no OBAs. The base stock is both acid- and lignin-free. The coating is acid-free.

Must still be saved from acidic mats and sunlight.

#### Archival paper
Archival papers are (mostly) acid-free and lignin-free. They can be made of virgin tree fiber (alpha-cellulose) or 25% to 100% cotton rag. They’re likely to have optical brightening agents (OBAs), chemicals that make the paper appear brighter white.

#### Photo grade paper
Most photo-grade paper is resin-coated and designed to look and feel like modern photo lab paper. The core is covered by a thin layer of polyethylene (plastic) coating, which gives the paper its photo feel, stability (flatness), water resistance, handling resistance, and excellent feed consistency. 

All resin-coated papers fall short of archival-grade for two reasons. First, the plastic content is not technically archival by museum standards. Second, the resin coating is slightly acidic, which will deteriorate the paper over time.

#### Common paper
Paper, having acid, degrades over time.  
you can put stable ink on non-archival paper and still achieve 70 years of on-display life.

### .01k yr

#### Shellac records
Quite brittle.

#### Vinyl records
Last 100 yrs under good conditions.

## Retrieval/ playback
Grammaphone doesn't require electricity to play sound. It's relatively easy to construct.

## Profession
- Record keepers
  - Recordkeepers are responsible for documents from the moment they are created by an entity up to and beyond the point when they are preserved solely as archives
- Archivists
  - Archivists tend to be responsible for records once they become archives and are thus no longer used for their original purpose.
