Siddhartha and Ashok are currently learning from the Stanford University’s online high school curriculum and give standardised examinations. Both boys state that they don’t miss formal school. They have time to pursue music and play the violin, apart from attending Veda classes and teaching Sanskrit. They are also learning Carnatic music from Trivandrum G. Seethalakshmi Ammal and the violin from Charumathi Raghuraman. Siddhartha says he is studying rare compositions from Padmashree SR Janakiraman."
