## Downsides
- Invasive surgery can cause more harm than good - and should be elected with care.

### Examples
- An artificial knee may get infected, leading to pus discharge, swelling and pain. Immune system cells have a harder time getting there and cleaning up.
- Myopes considering [refractive surgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_surgery "Refractive surgery") are advised that surgically correcting their nearsightedness may actually be a disadvantage after the age of 40 when the eyes become presbyopic and lose their ability to [accommodate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accommodation_%28eye%29 "Accommodation (eye)") or change focus because they will then need to use glasses for reading. \[[Wikipedia article on Presbyopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyopia)\]Â
