## PVC
- Oft has heavy metal stabilizers.

## CPVC 
- (flexible, chlorinated) without lead stabilizer ([VE](http://vikasecotech.com/whitepapers/Vikas_Ecotech_whitepaper_01.pdf)): [IM](https://dir.indiamart.com/search.mp?ss=lead+free+pvc+pipe&prdsrc=1)

### Negatives
- it is brittle and it can't withstand very high temperatures like copper can

## uPVC 
- Oft used in windows.

### Negatives
- References: [RB11](https://www.redbricks.org/2011/03/16/why-we-do-not-want-upvc-windows/).
- National Building Federation reportiii gives uPVC windows a life expectancy of 20-25 years, one reportiv states that up to 40% of units are failing within 5 years. 
- If uPVC windows are not cleaned regularly they quickly get permanently discoloured through dirt retention; it’s then impossible to restore them to a nearly new condition.

### Health effects
- As uPVC degrades from ultraviolet rays from the sun, it emits toxic gases, such as vinyl chloride, some of which enters the home, and eventually becomes brittle and powdery. 
- uPVC window frames continue to release mercury whilst in use & after they are disposed of.
- Because PVC catalyses its own decomposition, metal stabilisers are added to vinyl for construction and other extended-life applications. Common PVC additives are lead, cadmium, and organotins – all highly toxic.

## Environment 
- PVC is one of the most environmentally hazardous consumer materials ever producedx.
- PVC is the only major plastic that contains chlorine – the by-products are far more toxic, more persistent in the environment, and more likely to build up in the food supply & people’s bodies than similar chlorine-free chemicals.
- Chlorine production is one of the world’s most energy-intensive industrial processes, taking huge amounts of energy – about 1% of the world’s total electricity outputxi. Chlorine production for PVC uses an equivalent to the yearly output of eight medium-sized nuclear power plants.
  - Chlorine production causes mercury pollution which causes severe reproductive, developmental, and neurological impacts at low doses. 
- The production of PVC is one of the main sources of dioxin.
