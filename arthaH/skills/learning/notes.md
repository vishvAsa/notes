## Desiderata
- Easy to navigate to topic of interests (on a variety of devices)
- Highlights a summary (सूत्रमन्त्रादिरूपेण) decision for execution, separate from exploratory notes.
- Highlights evocatively core ideas and wonders. Tight focus on essence - Learning involves repeated summarization.
  - In math - Record important patterns of ideas and solution strategies, with
  examples/ counter-examples and important results.
- Builds complex ideas based on clear simple ideas.
- Easy to update, refactor.

## Media
### Web pages
- Have easy navigation (sub)site-level menus
- Have table-of-content tree menu
- Limit page size - navigation can be boring. Split to multiple pages.
  - Transclude pages with javascript as needed (for printing etc..)
- Summarize: At the top of the page, and repeatedly later as necessary.
  - Also summarize into sUtra-s from point of view of execution.
- When reading original works, add annotations in alternate color, size, style etc..
- Use an system which facilitates easy updates - markdown + jekyll + github + wiki-like-theme.

## Annotation
### Physical books

With physical books, I like to mark (with a pencil):
- words that are new to me (with meanings)
- words and phrases that I find beautiful
- grammatical flaws
- printing mistakes that I correct
- (In case of particularly difficult verses) - पद-endings (with vertical lines), their vibhakti-s (on top of word endings, numbered १-७, with additional markings as in _१'_ to distinguish words related to distinct objects terminating in the same vibhakti)
- my scores for beauty for (nearly) each verse - 1/5 to 5/5.
    - Sometimes these marks prefixed with क (to indicate that beauty in plot twist is being measured), र (to indicate rasa-beauty etc..)

### Google play ebook notes
- (automatic backup in Drive): [bit.ly/vv-play-notes](http://bit.ly/vv-play-notes). (Summarized in [this pic (see pic info)](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipOJQqymltNQMs7RHBz8rD2lWoa3EuEofzhzcYn5/photo/AF1QipPUr0S_cMva23_SAuLpR5J8CFc3kdOacKIn_Cu1).)
- Note: Mistakes in the backup tend to occur more with books Google would need to OCR-ed (because they don't have digitized "flowing" text).
- Example: [https://goo.gl/C9j3Vs](https://goo.gl/C9j3Vs).

- I use a temperature scale for marking verses: 4/4= red 3/4=yellow 2/4=green 1/4=blue (since there are only 4 highlighting colors in google play).
