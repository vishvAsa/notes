Workshops: Some explicitly deny that a presentation in a workshop does
not count as a publication. So such stuff is publishable elsewhere.
Other workshops are contrary.

Publish long versions of conference papers in journals.

1 top tier paper = many 2nd tier papers. It is far more important to
publish regularly in a top tier conference than to publish profusely in
a 2nd tier conference. Read papers from those conference and aim for
such work.
