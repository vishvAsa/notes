## Structure
Unrefined fats include double bonds in the carbon chain, which lead to a
molecular structure which is not a straight chain. Upon hydrogenation,
single bonds are formed in place of double bonds, with a strong
preference for the formation of trans-hydrocarbon backbone rather than
cis-bonds. Such molecules have a more linear structure.

## Hydrogenated oil
Most trans fats consumed today, however, are industrially created as a side effect of partial hydrogenation of plant oils. Partial hydrogenation changes a fatâ€™s molecular structure (raising its melting point and reducing rancidity), but this process also results in a portion of the changed fat becoming trans fat. 

## Effects

Trans facts tend to accumulate and eventually harden in blood-vessels,
particularly in the heart and the brain, leading to heart disease and
higher blood pressure.
