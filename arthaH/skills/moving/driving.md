## Common failure points
- narrow roads where vehicles need to scrape by
- entering and exiting parking
- merging into and out of highways 
- passing cars
- stalled vehicles or building vehicle jams (need sudden decrease in speed)

## Safety
### Passenger safety

- Seat belts
- headrest adjustment to prevent whiplash

### Anticipate dangers
- Scan surroundings using mirrors often. Emergency conditions requiring quick response may arise.
- Look at tires making the turn, don't trust the driver's signals.

### Maintain alertness
- switch lanes, even if unnecessary.
- Scan the radio.
- Travel with copilots.
- Schedule regular stops.

## Be comfortable

- Reason
  - Under discomfort, mind wanders, stupidity occurs.
- Keep head warm: beware striking wind
  - Stress--physical or otherwise--tenses the muscles in your neck, and you get stiff neck.
- Water
- Reduce sound from wind
- Cruise control
  - Avoid foot ankle pain.

## Obey traffic rules

### हेतु-स्मरणम्

increases chances of survival, avoids unnecessary agitation of the mind.

### Pay tolls

Use toll tag or cash. Alternative (mailed fines) is costly in time and money

## Positioning

Use reference points- ideally >2

- Lane markers on either side
- Silehoutte of the car ahead

## Speed control

- Maintain 3 to 5 second distance to next car.
- Drive at traffic speed: not too slow or too fast. Especially entering a highway.

### Lower in error spots
Reduce speed and be careful at points of frequent mistakes.

### Adjust to weather conditions
Dry brakes with slight pressure

## Change lanes, passing

Passing vehicles - dangerous recurrent activity.

Rejoining
- only when you can see the wheels of the passed vehicle in the rear view mirror.

Don't pass more than one car at a time.

Don't change lanes too close to a curve - Can't view/ be viewed by traffic in the other lane

### Be wary of stopped and turning cars

attuned to the expectation of moving cars, you may change lanes and collide with the car.

## Emergency

### Emergency vehicles

Drivers in either direction must stop when a school bus is picking up or dropping kids. Same with emergency vehicles.

### Personal

Stop safely.

- blowout or stalling
  - stay level-headed, don't apply brake or take foot off gas pedal; slowly coast to the side of the road.
- brake failure
  - Use emergency brake, with button pressed in order to avoid locked wheels;
  - try shifting to lower gear
  - look for something to rub (not crash) against.

Signal

- In case of breakdown: Raise hood, tie white cloth to door handle or antenna, start emergency flashers, setup warning signs.

Stay in the car or in a safe spot.

Roadside assistance program

- AAA or ARP

## Navigation

Text to speech GPS

Carry destination's phone number. Remember reason - Small businesses move often

## Parking

### Find a spot

### Parallel

- Within 1 foot of the curb
- No obstruction to other cars, driveways, fire extinguishers etc..
