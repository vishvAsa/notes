## Quality maps
- Detailed measurements available at [aqicn.org](http://aqicn.org/city/india/bengaluru/hebbal/) - shows AQI with breakdown.

## Pollutants
### Particulate matter
- Size
  - Common measurements: PM2.5 (2.5 micrometers), PM10 (10 micrometers)
  - "It is generally recognized that smaller particles are more harmful to human health. Unlike larger particles, PM0.1 can penetrate pulmonary tissue, enter the bloodstream, and circulate throughout the body. Thereby, PM0.1 can damage a number of internal systems that may be inaccessible to larger particles."
- Measurement
  - Units: μg/m³, AQI
    - For conversions: [airnow calculator](https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.calculator)
  - Instruments:
    - Can purchase USB charging censors which talk to phone apps quite cheaply.
- Healthy levels
  - Indoor 24-Hour PM2.5 levels 55.5μg/m³ = 150 AQI or above : unhealthy for all. Sensitive groups get affected at lower levels (> 35.5μg/m³ = 100 AQI).
  - For outdoors, 24-Hour averaging is not that reliable - winds have a big effect.

#### Sources
- Dust from sweeping on concrete yard in Mountain view raised PM2.5 levels from 20μg/m3 to 148 μg/m3.
