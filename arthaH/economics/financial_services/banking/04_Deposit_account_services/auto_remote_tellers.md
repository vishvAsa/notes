## ATM-s

Banks usually have a network of ATM machines whence cash may be drawn and deposits made. A debit card is issued for their use. They may be associated with an incentive to encourage its use: why?

Use of ATMs maintained by other banks results in fees, eg: 2$ for BoA; which may be refunded by the bank with the account.

## Remote deposits

Banks often offer smart-phone applications or websites from which deposits can be made. For example, deposits can be made by using the phoneâ€™s camera on a check.
