## Economic value indicators

Certain numbers reveal the current evaluation of the economy. The health of the economy can be roughly viewed in terms of the financial health and confidence of 4 major components: consumers, banks, non-bank businesses, government.

Eg: Prices of critical commodities (like oil), value of index funds, growth in real estate prices, government debt, public debt.

### Gross domestic product

#### As a summary

This is a measure of the total gross income of the country.

#### Comparison with GPA

Like the GPA in case of academia, it is a good summary, but it does not include finer details which could be gleaned from the whole data, such as how rich an average person feels.

#### Avoiding overcounting

To avoid double-counting and to include all services and goods which go into making a certain product, only end-consumption is considered. To avoid over-counting, money spent on imported goods is not counted - that contributes to the exporting country’s GDP.

Goods produced during previous years is not included in the GDP - even if they continue to be consumed. Instead, an imputed rent is included in the calculation.

#### Environmental costs

The costs to the environment from economic activity leading to growth is not included in the GDP. These costs arise from decreased life expectancy, greater sickness, lesser tourist pleasure etc.. Cost to life expectancy can be calculated based on the higher salary yielded by increased risk to life (around 60$ more for .0001 greater risk in 2011).

On the other hand efforts at spending to repair environmental damage gets counted - eg: environmental damage from BP’s oil spill is not included, but money spent on clean-up effort is!

## Booms and busts

Economies generally keep cycling through periods of booms and busts (described below). This is due to heuristic way in which demand and supply are balanced.

### Boom

To meet demand, industry in certain sectors grow - often on borrowed money, counting on future profits. Industries indeed produce profit for some time, but production keeps increasing until production exceeds demand.

During this time, the industries’ economic value - or at least their evaluation by the securities market- grows. Their operating cost increases because they invest more and hire more workers. Banks are more willing to lend at low interest rates.

Consumers, being able to find employment and loans, feel richer and more confident in their spending.

Note that a boom is different from a bubble - which is a valuation error, rather than a overproduction problem.

### Bust

Aka recession.

#### Market causes and reactions

When production exceeds demand, some industries go bankrupt, defaulting on their loans. Prices of securities fall, because the market has by now learned that the demand for product(s) is lower than the supply.

#### Reaction of banks

If loans are too big, lender banks fail, or start hoarding capital in order to compensate for losses by becoming reluctant to make new loans.

##### Role of government

The government’s budget deficit has an impact on the interest rate on government debt, which inturn affects the rate of interest charged by banks in their lending.

#### Business response

Due to impeded entrepreneurship, GDP growth reduces drastically. Due to bankrupt industries, the economy may even shrink! Businesses which remain solvent respond by cutting costs (including laying of people), selling their goods and services for cheaper to attract consumers. Due to the cost cutting, companies may in fact make record profits!

#### Consumer behavior

Consumers feel poor due to falling prices and fears of unemployment, and don’t have confidence to spend.

#### Impact on prices

As consumers have less money to spend, prices may fall.

Because businesses do not expand their services, projected demand for oil actually falls. This leads to decreased price of oil and oil-related enterprises.

#### Recovery

To recover from a bust, consumer confidence must be restored, government should cut deficit, banks’ willingness to lend should increase, and businesses should feel confident to hire more people.

#### International Contagion

When a certain country is experiencing a recession, it can adversely affect others due to many reasons.

Countries whose businesses (especially banks) had lent to recession-hit businesses and governments experience greater risk. This triggers reduction in lending by banks.

Countries with otherwise healthy businesses which export goods to recession hit countries also face reduced profitability due to reduced demand and due to decrease in value of the recession-hit country’s currency.

## Investment

GDP growth usually requires investment in business enterprise. But, investments may have returns either in the short-term or in the long-term. Investment which responds to consumer demand yields immediate benefits, and is often favored.

Investments vary in quality: for example, a rich government investment firm can increase GDP by just building cities which will never be occupied in the desert.

### Consumer demand and public debt

Individuals borrow money, and they have to repay them. The purchasing power of people correspondingly decreases.

### High public debt

When the money they collectively borrow is close to the (projected) GDP (national money production), there is trouble - it means that people are collectively incapable of repaying their debts.

This has happened in USA in 1929 and in 2009; thus Americans have financed their high individual standard of living with borrowed money they cannot repay. This eventually may lead to most individuals in USA being less worthy of credit and investment - leading to economic depression.

### Global savings

Increased prosperity in many parts of the world has resulted in greater amount of money becoming available for investment. IMF tracks this number - it exceeds the world’s GDP 5-fold, at 83 trillion $ in 2009.

Investment managers seek to utilize this money by investing in something which yields good return and low risk, with emphasis being on one or the other depending on their recent experience (and partially based on their long-term education). Their willingness to take reasonable risk is important to spur continued GDP growth.

## Disadvantages of growth

### Social costs

A society often pays an excessive price for economic growth in the form of environmental pollution, eroding social/ cultural values, compassion.

### Inflation

The injection of new money by governments to favor economic growth leads to inflation/ currency devaluation, which disproportionately affects the poor, for the following reason.

The poor spend a greater fraction of their income on food/ raw materials, whereas rich tend to spend a greater fraction of their wealth on services. During inflation, the price of commodities grows at a much greater rate than the price of services.

#### Growth imbalance

Thus, with growth, the monetary imbalance between the rich and the poor tends to grow.

## Effect of local disasters

Suppose that a natural disaster like a hurricane in the gulf coast of USA or a earthquake + tsunami + nuclear leak in a part of Japan (2011) occurs. Regardless of where such a disaster occurs, much wealth is destroyed, and the economy of the affected region is severely set back.

If the country where the disaster occurs is advanced - like Japan or USA, effect on the GDP may not even be noticeable both in the short and the long term. This is because, these countries have redundant economic units (roads/ industries) which compensate for the destruction; and they have savings or lines of credit which they can use to rebuild - such investment increases, rather than decrease the GDP.

But, if the country is poor (eg: Haiti earthquake 2010), and the affected region is economically important, redundancy is low, and the entire economy suffers as a result.

## Financial crises

Growth in economic value slows down drastically sometimes. The immediate cause for this disruption is a drop in investment/ money-lending due to varied reasons.

### 1929: great depression

#### Importance

A transformative event in world (especially US) history: disagreement about the goodness of new deal set lasted throughout the following century as rivalry between Democrats and Republicans in politics.

#### Boom + bubbles

In the 1920’s, there was over-investment and under-consumption - there was a boom and a bubble. The bubble burst.

#### Bust, credit crisis

There was over-indebtedness. Some banks crashed. Depositors withdrew money from other banks. So, remaining banks became reluctant to lend money. On Oct 29 1929, Stock market crashed.

#### Deflationary cycle

In response to rising unemployment and falling income, businesses - in order to sell goods - had to reduce prices. The reduced prices led to further decrease in wages; which in turn led to reduced prices and reduced profits, which in-turn fed the credit crisis. Thus vicious cycles were formed

Commodity prices, especially food (and therefore farmland) fell; and farmers got much poorer. Disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor had grown.

#### Hoarding savings

Some banks refused to accept new deposits, because they were unable to find satisfactory investments. So, people, for psychological reason, wanted to convert their currency to gold instead - which was possible because the currency was exchangeable for gold on surrender to the government.

#### Wrong fixes

To discourage hoarding of savings in the form of gold and to encourage investments, the inexperienced Fed tightened credit - this raised interest rates both for savings accounts and for loans - even though the opposite was required to encourage banks to lend money. Thus, the status quo continued.

International trade broke down: tariffs were increased in order to protect the profitability of local industry.

#### Ditching gold standard

UK, USA ditched the gold-standard - to discourage gold hoarding and perhaps because of the inadequacy of the gold reserve. This allowed currency to be printed to encourage banks to lend. Also, as a way of injecting money into the economy, the government started buying back gold at higher prices with newly printed money.

This was critical. Countries which ditched the gold standard later got out of the depression later.

#### New deal 1

FD Roosevelt took over from Hoover, promised vigorous experimentation to find some way out. He kept citizens informed through a radio show, stopped prohibition of liquor and was popular.

Farmers were paid not to grow crops - to raise food prices. Working hours and conditions favorable to workers was encouraged: growth which was favorable for the rich was slowed down. The huge unemployed population was employed by the government to build infrastructure. Banks, with government aid, were set to operate soundly; and small deposits were guaranteed by the government .

### 2008: sub-prime mortgages

#### Bad credit

At the most basic level, a lot of bad loans were made to consumers: not just in buying homes, but also in general.

##### Eager investors

In 2000, US federal bank indicated that government bonds will continue to offer low interest rates - at 1%; so investors managing global savings - which had recently grown due to rapid economic growth - eager to get profit despite risk sought investment avenues.

##### Bad mortgage-backed securities

At this time, people in the US financial industry invented mortgage-backed securities, by which investors could buy a share of ownership in loans. There was so much supply of investor money and such short supply of worthy investments, that people started making bad loans to people incapable of paying back in order to sell shares in these loans and make profit in the short term. Borrowers lied about their incomes - often encouraged to do so by lenders. Housing prices were also increasing, emboldening lenders into thinking that foreclosure would be a way to remain profitable even if borrowers defaulted.

#### Credit default swaps

Investors buying risky mortgage-backed securities got insurance/ bet that these securities will fail; and this insurance business was neither public nor regulated. So, insurers such as AIG failed.

#### Consequences

In 2007, people started defaulting, real estate prices fell. Investors lost much money.

##### Bank collapse

Banks (especially investment banks who created and held on to mortgage-backed securities) which invested in bad mortgages were insolvent (or solvent only in paper because they refused to liquidate their toxic assets at current market value).

##### Credit crisis

Money market mutual funds, which gave out short term loans to businesses (commercial paper market) partially suffered because of loans to those who invested in mortgage-backed securities, and such short term lending froze due to a panic. Investors who managed the global savings pool became very risk-averse.

So, this led to a big slow-down in investment as both types of investors were not willing to lend money -either to regain solvency in case of banks or due to risk aversion. This credit-crisis hit countries like Iceland, which were now unable to low-interest loans.

##### Effect on industry

Shrinking markets caused industries such as GM to fail.

##### Effect on consumers

Consumers lost jobs, owed huge debt, felt poorer and reduced spending.

##### Profit

Some mutual funds (like Magnetar) profited from this crisis because they understood, encouraged and bet against risky securities using credit default swaps.

Employees of investment banks who created the heavily traded risky  
mortgage-backed securities and ignored their fiduciary duty towards the investor got rich from bonuses earned from fees received by the bank.

#### Mitigation

Central banks created a lot of new money in a huge effort to encourage investment/ lending and thus growth; and to finance efforts to rescue failing businesses.

Banks and industries were rescued - Eg: by US government subsidizing people who bought toxic assets from banks at slightly higher prices.

#### Devaluation

Commodity prices (esp: oil price) increased.
