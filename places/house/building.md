## Longevity of elements
- Ceramic Tiles and stone - lasts millennia
- Logs - last 1k years in japan, with wood joints.
- Mud/ brick walls protected by long roof extensions - hundreds of years
- RCC - avg 100 years.

## Frames
### Supporting wall
- Lower steel use compared to other options.
- Dry wall strength is 25% to 30% more than wet wall strength. Good structural engineers design assuming the latter (avoids collapse in case of submersion etc.). 

#### Risks
- Damage to supporting wall reduces strength.
- Maintaining wall thickness is important for load bearing capacity. Cutting groves for concealed electrical wiring, fitting shelves etc.. along reduces effective wall thickness.

### Metal frame
- Steel bars (C sections, T sections etc..) used for beams and pillars. 
- Can build fast. 
- Risk: Fire can melt the frame.

### RCC frame
- Very common.

### Wood frame
- Beams and pillars are made of wood.

## Wiring
Considered in electricity pages.

## Off beat teams
### Design teams (Bengaluru)
- Mahijaa designers. Team with Nagesh contractor.
- Chitra (a bit costly)
