## Frames
### Supporting wall
- Lower steel use compared to other options.
- Dry wall strength is 25% to 30% more than wet wall strength. Good structural engineers design assuming the latter (avoids collapse in case of submersion etc.). 

#### Risks
- Damage to supporting wall reduces strength.
- Maintaining wall thickness is important for load bearing capacity. Cutting groves for concealed electrical wiring, fitting shelves etc.. along reduces effective wall thickness.

### Metal frame
- Steel bars (C sections, T sections etc..) used for beams and pillars. 
- Can build fast. 
- Risk: Fire can melt the frame.

### RCC frame
- Very common.

### Wood frame
- Beams and pillars are made of wood.

## Blocks
Popular choices : Fire baked bricks, concrete blocks, fly ash blocks (low weight, high carbon footprint) 

### Mud blocks
- Environmentally friendly. Made at site by mixing cement, mud and water and then pressing into blocks before curing.

#### Design teams (Bengaluru)
- Mahijaa, Nagesh contractor.

## Wiring
### Common desiderata
- Separate circuit for high power vs low power appliances. The latter may be powered by UPS systems (inverters backed by DC battery).
- Fuses or trip switches at switch boards and even at the plug point.
- 2 way switches for staircase lights, bedroom lights and fans.
- Good placement anticipating appliances like AC, fan, lights.

### Technique
- Types: Concealed (within walls and roofs) vs exposed (within casing).
- In case of concealed wiring in supporting walls, wiring design seeks to minimize horizontal groves within walls (barring above and below windows) so as to not reduce effective wall thickness. Vertical groves are ok.
- Wires are sent in hops from point to point (via pipes which oft drop from the roof) - so that theoretically any point may be connected to any other point via other points. A practical limitation arises from the number of wires vs thickness of pipes.
- Wires are threaded through pipes by pushing in steel springs.
