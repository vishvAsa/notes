title = "Toilet"
+++

## Bowl type
- Squatting pan
- Western seat
- Chamber pot, baby potty, "bed pan"

## Connection mode
### Water seal
Blocks smell, flies etc.. 

### Dry toilet
Aka pail closet, pail privy.  
Urine and water are diverted to a separate hole.  
Post defecation, dry matter is ideally thrown in to cover the feces.

Odors can be a problem. 

## Waste collection

### Bucket toilet
Bucket under the bowl is periodically emptied.  
Bucket is lined with newspaper, dry leaves, sawdust, sand etc.. for easy emptying.  
The receptacle should be in a closed container - to avoid flies.

2 bucket system - one for feces, another for urine.

Container toilet - Like a bucket toilet - except it's sealed before collection.

#### Composting toilet 
Instead of the bucket there may be a composting chamber, with ventilation pipe - for mostly aerobic degradation.  
Can accept limited urine - else better to divert to avoid anaerobic conditions.

Moist carbon material must be hadded.

Pathogen destruction rates in composting toilets are usually low, particularly of helminth eggs.

### Pit latrine
Hole over a pit.  

#### Shelter
Often has a shelter - aka outhouse for protection from weather. 

No-roof - more light, ventilation, disinfection via solar radiation, less weight. But top should be raised to prevent rain runoff and overflowing. 

#### Hole
The hole may be in a slab or between stones.  
If hole is bigger than the recommended 25cm/ 10 in - Risk of kids falling in.  
Hole may be closed with a lid if inside a shed, to prevent flies. Eg. kaDaba village in 1990s

#### Pit
Pit may be partially lined at the top to prevent collapse - eg. during emptying.  
Circular pit is less likely to collapse.

The pit may have a ventilation pipe (with a fly screen) going to the roof.  
Twin pits with pipe sealing may be used.

##### Depth
Pit should be at least 2 metres (6 feet) above groundwater level.  
Arborloo pits are shallow - but there is a slab on top - good for planting trees later.   
In old confrederate states, pits were made to be 6 feet from the ground to prevent hookworms etc..

#### Location
Drinking water wells should be far away laterally (how far depends on soil conditions).  
Most, but not all pathogens die within 50 days of travel through the subsurface.

When pit fills up, the latrine should be moved or emptied.  
If latrine is moved, a fruit tree can be planted  (arborloo technique) 

### Cess-pits
- Aka cess-pit, cess pool, soak-pit
- Pipes brings feces etc.. in.
- Lined with stones etc.. Still risk of cave-ins.
  
Cleaning

- Used to be cleared at night. Risky for cleaners.
- With pumps for the liquid, then shovels

### Septic tank
- Basic designs - Can fill up fast, become smelly.
- inlet → sedimentation of sludge, floating scum, anaerobic decomposition → draining.
- pathogens are usually reduced due to heat, soil absorption
- periodic desludging needed.
- widely used in EU and US. Earlier many drained to watercourses.

### Toilet bags
- plastic
- biodegradable


### Absorbants
- powdered lime, sand, etc.. are added before and after use to avoid smell, flies, etc..
- "Earth closet" was used to flush such material over feces.

### Plastic toilet booths
- Uses chemicals to minimize smell.
- Tank's often emptied to sewer.
- Often include ventilation pipe leading to the roof (wouldn't work well if door is open to wind). 

## Waste disposal
### Nutrients
Urine is high in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and important micro-nutrients.  
Can help offset "peak phosphorus" crisis. phosphate in urine could supply 22% of the total demand.
Might need to be balanced with carbon.  

### Pathogens
High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill helminth eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens.


### Open defecation
If in high concentration, can lead to disease spread. Otherwise ok.  
Human faeces normally take about a year to biodegrade outdoors.  
Emptying unaged feces from bucket toilets etc..  
is mostly as good/bad as open defectation.

Can dig a "cat"-hole, cover with soil.

#### Tree bog
Raised platform for shitting in compost pile among nutrient hungry vegetation (eg. willow trees, mint). Seating platform is atleast 1m high.  
Feces is well ventilated for aerobic decomposition.  
Carbon rich material is used to cover feces - to balance urine nitrogen.   
Weed nettles soon grow if allowed.

### City sewage treatment
Toilets connected to city sewage system are easy to build and maintain.  

Typical systems:

- toilet bowl → pipe with chambers inbetween → town sewage pipe with manholes! → sewage treatment plant (hopefully)  
  Chambers are necessary for inspection and maintenance. 
  - Pipes
    - Concrete pipes tend to degrade, be susceptible to roots, rats and cave-ins. PVC pipes are better.
- Exposed gutters.
- Workers collect waste from cess-pits and buckets (eg. via special "conservancy" lanes + special bucket doors); and then dispose.

### Fertilizer
Good for fruit trees - not vegetables due to disease risk.  
Dry fertilizer is better.

### Grey water
aka sullage.  
all streams except for the wastewater from toilets.
