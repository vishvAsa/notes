title = "Toilet"
+++

## Bowl type
- Squatting pan
- Western seat
- Chamber pot

## Connection mode
### Water seal
Blocks smell, flies etc.. 

### Dry toilet
Urine and water are diverted to separate holes.  
Post defecation, dry matter is ideally thrown in to cover the feces.

## Waste collection

### Bucket toilet
Bucket under the bowl is periodically emptied.  
Bucket is lined with newspaper, dry leaves, sawdust, sand etc.. for easy emptying.

2 bucket system - one for feces, another for urine.

### Pit latrine
Hole over a pit.  
Has a shelter - aka outhouse.

#### Hole
The hole may be in a slab or between stones.  
If hole is bigger than the recommended 25cm/ 10 in - Risk of kids falling in.  
Hole may be closed with a lid if inside a shed, to prevent flies. Eg. kaDaba village in 1990s

#### Pit
Pit may be partially lined at the top to prevent collapse - eg. during emptying.  
The pit may have a ventilation pipe (with a fly screen) going to the roof.  
Twin pits with pipe sealing may be used.

##### Depth
Pit should be at least 2 metres (6 feet) above groundwater level.  
Yet, it should be 6 feet from the ground to prevent hookworms etc..

#### Location
Drinking water wells should be far away laterally (how far depends on soil conditions).  
Most, but not all pathogens die within 50 days of travel through the subsurface.

When pit fills up, the latrine should be moved or emptied.

### Cess-pits
- Aka cess-pit, cess pool, soak-pit
- Pipes brings feces etc.. in.
- Lined with stones etc.. Still risk of cave-ins.
  
Cleaning

- Used to be cleared at night. Risky for cleaners.
- With pumps for the liquid, then shovels

### Septic tank
- Can fill up fast, become smelly.


### Toilet bags
- plastic
- biodegradable


### Absorbants
- powdered lime, sand, etc.. are added before and after use to avoid smell, flies, etc..

### Plastic toilet booths
- Uses chemicals to minimize smell.
- Tank's often emptied to sewer.
- Often include ventilation pipe leading to the roof (wouldn't work well if door is open to wind). 

## Waste disposal
### Open defecation
If in high concentration, can lead to disease spread. Otherwise ok.

Best practice - dig a "cat"-hole, cover with soil.

Emptying unaged feces from bucket toilets etc..  
is mostly as good/bad as open defectation.

### City sewage treatment
Toilets connected to city sewage system are easy to build and maintain.  

Typical systems:

- toilet bowl → pipe with chambers inbetween → town sewage pipe with manholes! → sewage treatment plant (hopefully)  
  Chambers are necessary for inspection and maintenance. 
  - Pipes
    - Concrete pipes tend to degrade, be susceptible to roots, rats and cave-ins. PVC pipes are better.
- Exposed gutters.
- Workers collect waste from cess-pits and buckets (eg. via special "conservancy" lanes + special bucket doors); and then dispose.
