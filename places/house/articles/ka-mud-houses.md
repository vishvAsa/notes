## shashAnka, pAvagADa area
My ancestral house was atleast 100 years old before we abandoned it, due to safety issues.

– Most of it was adobe. The walls were atleast 2' thick
– Wooden pillars, granite floor
– The roof was tightly knit bamboo over wooden beams. Top layered with alkaline clayey soil. If there were continuous/long rains, it used to leak. My aunt spent atleast two decades repairing the collapsing walls/roof at places, before building a pukka house for themselves

This is where, I lost hopes on adobe, cob etc.
