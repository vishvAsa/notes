Nearly 40% of all homes in the U.S. are built in what is called the wildland urban interface (WUI), and nearly all of those homes located west of the Mississippi are vulnerable to wildland fire.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;shashanka-pavagada-area&#34;&gt;shashAnka, pAvagADa area&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My ancestral house was atleast 100 years old before we abandoned it, due to safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;– Most of it was adobe. The walls were atleast 2&amp;rsquo; thick&#xA;– Wooden pillars, granite floor&#xA;– The roof was tightly knit bamboo over wooden beams. Top layered with alkaline clayey soil. If there were continuous/long rains, it used to leak. My aunt spent atleast two decades repairing the collapsing walls/roof at places, before building a pukka house for themselves&lt;/p&gt;</description>
