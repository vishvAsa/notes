## Lime plaster
- Get recently kilned lime powder. Slake it in water and leave it to soak in water for an absolute minimum of two weeks. Such lime (as long as itâ€™s always covered with a layer of water) gets better the longer you leave it, you can keep it for years. Simply take the lime paste and add sand, then plaster as usual.
