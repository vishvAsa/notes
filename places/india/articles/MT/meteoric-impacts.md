Was looking at records of meteoritic impacts in India. Wonder how many of the falls have been preserved.

1. 1800 CE shortly after the English conquest of the tyrant of Mysuru a fall was reported at shrIrangapattana which is was said to be "the size of an elephant": Exaggeration ?

2. Dec 19th 1798 CE the vArANasi fall -- a loud explosion was heard; several falling bodies were heard crashing to the ground. Another report of objects falling from the sky was reported 14 km from vArANasi. Next day several fragments of a meteorite were recovered. Any survive?

3. "The Butsura fall". A fall of up to 5 stone on 12 May 1861 CE during the days of English tyranny in the vicinity of Bagaha village, Champaran District, with largest pieces of ~19 kg and ~5 kg mass; total 29 kg. Some pieces are in Kolkata and others in London

4. The dharmashAlA fall in the Panjab on ~2:15 PM, 14th July, 1860 CE. An Irish observer noted that the hands of the "c001ies" who picked up the fragments were benumbed & they had to drop it right away.

5. On February 28, 1857 as the first war of independence was raging a 77.5 kg rock fell from the sky at "Parnallee", rAmanAthapuram, TN. It is said that have been accompanied by crashing noises for 15-20 mins. A fragment now lies in London.

6. Jul 15 (?) 1810 CE "a great fall of stones from the sky" in Fatehgarh near Shahabad in Uttar Pradesh, India.

7. Some time in Nov 1814 CE the english recorded a  great stone falling from the sky in their newly conquered territories between ga~NgA & yamunA
   any fragments survive?

Regarding the Fatehgarh incident we have the following English account: It was apparently a rather destructive impact. This is reminiscent of the Ming record from the spring of 1490 CE where they state that a giant fall of stones from the sky in Ch'ing-yang killed thousands of peoples. This might have been the fragment of a comet reported by  Japanese astronomers in that year.

For some more Indian falls see: https://t.co/0OsuYbpsE9

Three major impact craters of India which are due to even bigger falls than the above. These probably occurred in the last 5000-100000 years
