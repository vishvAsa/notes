Cellular jail - book tickets in advance , avoid queues.

Mahatma Gandhi National Park and Chidiya Tapu are okay. Small places- get to see biodiversity. Kids will like. Relatively less crowded. 

Only good thing about Andaman Trip is Havelock Island. It is renamed as Swaraj Dweep now (the havelock island). Radha Nagar and VijayaNagar are best beaches in the country ! Sunsets are a little early so, post lunch , you all can leave for the Radhanagar beach and comeback after you play there until sunset. Havelock is the best part of Andaman trip ! Kids will really have fun.

If you are planning for water sports(snorkelling/scuba diving) beware of inflated prices they quote.

### Travel
We hired two 2-wheelers for our family of four and did took the trips from hotel to beaches.

Travel to Havelock is by ferry. Private one is fast and charges 1200 per person. Govt ones are a little cheaper. Slow but not bad if kids can adjust in govt bus like travel scenes.



### Food
Beware of eating places also in Port Blair. All M owned. We only ate at Annapurna.

### Baratang mud volcanoes
Do not take the trip to Baratang. It’s a Sham. Too long a journey to see tiny mud volcanoes. Journey through protected forest but you can’t get down nor you can open your windows. You have to wake up early and wait in a big line of cars entering forest. Not at all worth the energy of kids!

## Sanjaya
Havelock island is beautiful, spend enough time there. The radhanagar beach at havelock island is one of a kind , extremely beautiful and clean.
