 STARS e-Ticketing Portal has moved to a new url - https://dss.andamannicobar.gov.in/eticketing    
 
E-Ticket Booking is allowed from 09:00 am to 04:00 pm IST on all days including Sundays. Can book only 10 days in advance.    
Big difference between islander vs non-islander fares.

Real-time Voyage and PNR status can be viewed from Online Enquiry Service.    

In case of voyage cancellation by DSS, the registered passenger/user must cancel the E-Ticket PNR to receive the full refund amount. PNR Cancellation facility is allowed up to 10 days of actual date of sailing. No refund will be provided if the PNR is not cancelled within the defined cancellation period.
