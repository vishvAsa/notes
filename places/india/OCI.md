## Notifications
- Ministry of Home Affairs issued a [notification on March 4](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2021/225647.pdf) dramatically altering the compact between OCIs and the Indian state. This notification, which is issued under [Section 7B of the Citizenship Act, 1955](https://www.mea.gov.in/images/pdf/extracts-of-citizenship-act1955.pdf), supersedes three earlier notifications issued on [April 11, 2005](https://www.mea.gov.in/images/pdf/5oci-2005.pdf), [January 5, 2007](https://www.mea.gov.in/images/pdf/4oci-notification.pdf), and [January 5, 2009](https://www.mea.gov.in/images/pdf/2oci-notifi2009.pdf), which laid down the rights of the OCIs.

## Restrictions
- These restrictions include a requirement for OCIs to secure a special permit to undertake “any research”, to undertake any “missionary” or “Tablighi” or “journalistic activities” or to visit any area in India notified as [“protected”, “restricted” or “prohibited”](https://www.mha.gov.in/PDF_Other/AnnexVII_01022018.pdf).
- the notification now equates OCIs to “foreign nationals” in respect of “all other economic, financial and educational fields” for the purposes of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2003 although past circulars by the Reserve Bank of India under FEMA will hold ground.

## Benefits
- OCIs can however continue to purchase land (other than agricultural land)
  - OCI-s can inherit the agricultural land/plantation property/ farmland.
- Can pursue the profession of medicine, law, architecture and accountancy and seek parity with Indian citizens with regard to airfares and entry fee to monuments and parks. 
- OCIs can also continue to seek enrolment in Indian educational institutions on par with NRIs but not for seats reserved exclusively for Indian citizens.
