## 3 valleys
Bengaluru is situated at approximately 3000 feet above mean sea level. When it rains unless the water is retained the rain water will flow down to lower levels. When Three generations of Kempegowdas built layered lakes they kept this aspect in mind, hence they interconnected the lakes through an excellent network of canals called Rajkaluves so that when the lakes in higher elevations filled out then the water flowed to the lakes in lower elevation.

To understand Bengaluruâ€™s water management system, it is important to understand the cityâ€™s topography. Bengaluru has three major natural valley/drainage zones, and three minor ones. The major valleys are Vrishabhavathi Valley, Koramangala-Challaghatta Valley and Hebbal Valley. The minor valleys are Tavarekere, Kathriguppe and Arkavathi.

When these valleys are blocked by mindless town planning or lack of it.. and aided by highly corrupt combination of political, bureaucratic lobby and greedy real estate thugs then where does water go ?
