## Origins
Records show that Mattūru was founded when a Vijayanagara emperor named Rāmarāya granted some land to Sanketi smārta brāhmaṇa-s he stumbled upon on the banks of the river Tungā. {[YT Video](https://youtu.be/s0I8h5oCbrQ?t=269)} With this land, a thriving brāhmaṇa community was able to sustain itself while sticking to their sacred duty to the Gods and society. 

## Recent
While the study and practice of veda-s and smArta-karma-s continued ceaselessly; shrauta-karma-s (rituals prescribed directly in the veda-s, like soma-yāga) were revived in the latter half of 20th century after a gap of about 200 years. In 1980-2, a visiting renunciate, the leader of the pejāvara maṭha of the mādhva-s, spurred the adaption of Samskṛta as means of communication {[YT1](https://youtu.be/s0I8h5oCbrQ?t=392), [YT2](https://youtu.be/a8GM5YpC3Us?t=366)} - especially in the context of teaching, ritual and debate.
