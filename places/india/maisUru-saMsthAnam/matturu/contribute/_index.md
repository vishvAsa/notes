## Why?
### Contribution of Mattūru
![Explaining to outsiders](https://i.imgur.com/ZXLNs2b.jpg) 

Mattūru preserves a vigorous kernel of the pristine life of vaidika brāhmaṇa-s. Stepping into Mattūru, is like stepping into a past age - and a potential part of our future! It is not too improbable that we will find refuge in the virile lifestyle and ideals of our distant ancestors such as Rāma, Kṛṣṇa and father Manu - even as we meet the challenges of today. Whether it is Shrauta and smarta ritual, mastery over the vedic lore and philosophy or delight in the classical arts - as long as the current Mattūru ecosystem persists, these will persist. And so will a warm and welcoming people, who will happily explain the ways of the sages to curious visitors and students without compromising the essence.

As we can see in the [intro page](../index.md), Mattūru is unique in this regard. It is extremely hard to create another Mattūru elsewhere (though we should try). In fact, but for this tiny spot of earth, we would scarcely believe that such an ecosystem can exist in this day and age.

As an example, villagers from Mattūru and neighboring Hosahaḷḷi played a major role in (trans)forming [Mohit Bharadwaj, founder of Vaidika Bhārata](http://indiafacts.org/after-millenia-tradition-reborn-vaidika-bharata/), who has gone on to play a major role in reviving the near-extinct Śānkhāyana branch of the Ṛgveda and shrauta ritual tradition in the heartland of the ancient Bhārata-s in North India. Several outsiders have studied in Mattūru for extended periods of time; some have even come to settle there with their families (such as Pradīpa, a devout Āśvalāyana agnihotrin and Rājārām Mūrti, a former businessman)!

### Influence from outside
The Mattūru agrahāra is not cut off from the rest of the world - they interact and contribute to the well-being of others, and are in turn buffeted by outside lures and pressures. Some youngsters from the village choose to leave to become engineers and doctors; some stay contentedly stay back to become the future embodiments of vedic ideals. Though the agrahāra is self sustaining, thanks to ancient land grants to the resident brāhmaṇa families, it does benefit from outside contributions for some of its scholarly and educational activities.

We should ensure that this outside influence continues to be as positive as possible. Out of gratefulness and frank self interest in letting our children have access to a place like Mattūru, we should contribute to its sustenance and security.
