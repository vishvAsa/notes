Community grazing ground is reserved and preserved in many parts of India. Is this situation common in KA, AP and TN?  
In N India, corrupt local sarpanches lease them out (at low rates at that) to favorites for farming.

## Tamil nADu
N TN was/is supposedly much better than tanjAvUr area - less periyarist influence, more telugu H influence.  
Farm-workers supposedly routinely cheated owners in giving produce share.

### mAniyams
In Uvallur, 1/4 of arable land was revenue free; and half the share thence went to various local service communities/ institutions.  From JK Bajaj and MD Shrinivas research on Ullavur. 

Elsewhere, it was 70%. (See [devadAsi lands article](/notes/sapiens/branches/Aryan/satem/indo-iranian/indo-aryan/jAti-varNa-practice/v2/persons/misc_v1-origin/brit-age/articles/devadAsI-lands))
