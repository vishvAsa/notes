      <description>&lt;p&gt;palaveri village in pallava-desha near kAnchIpuram hosted an agrahAra, where rAjagopAla, a reknowned shrIvaiShNava scholar resided. His son, popularly known as bAlAjI, also a scholar, was raised there form 1973 till early 1990s (age 20). These are some recollections pertaining to village life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Abbreviations for the 4 varna-s - v1, v2, v3, v4.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;v4-piety&#34;&gt;v4 Piety&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The farmers would be entirely free of agricultural labors for much of the year. Then, they used to perform and enjoy plays based on rAmAyaNa and mahAbhArata all night long. They used to be shy of performing before my respected father, so he used to watch from far away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
