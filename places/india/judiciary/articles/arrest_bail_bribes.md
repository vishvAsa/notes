"Justice on Sale"

Let me tell you a real story about India’s Justice System.

My friend’s elder brother (lower middle class family) got arrested in a money-matter worth Rs20 lakhs. The story is not about him, or the merits of the case.

It is about what happens next.

My friend applied for bail in sessions court. The case has already been adjourned multiple times (by design). He has to pay money for every hearing. He has already paid around 90K.

My friend has been told that nothing will move till “1.5-2 lakhs” in total are extracted out of every person. There are poor people in jail for 6-8 years, simply because they cannot afford to pay money to get out.

The judge’s “gardener” approached my friend outside court and told him that judge ka “rate” is 80K to secure bail. Else, the adjournments will keep happening and there will be no progress.

Then there are certain advocates who know the “kaali kartoots” of that particular judge. They are able to get favorable judgements from her. But they are extremely expensive to hire. My friend couldn’t afford any of them.

On the other hand, there is hard cash to be paid to the police to ensure they don’t thrash his brother. It’s like an IPL auction. If the other party pays 40K, you have to pay 60K. If they pay 80K, you have to pay 100K.

Money has to be paid to different people to get different things done. Everything has a price.

Mind you, this is just the price for bail. And that too in sessions court (imagine what goes on in the HC/SC). That too in a non-metro location. Apparently, the price is double if it was in a city.

Like I said, this is just to secure ‘bail’. There is a different rate sheet going around to settle the case. My friend, who is from a middle class family, will most certainly have to sell a ‘house’ to be able to afford these expenses.

Next time you hear a senior judge or the CJI talking about how the ‘doors of the court’ are open for everyone, and how even the poor get justice here, remember that this is the experience of ordinary people dealing with courts. There is no hope in hell for the poor to get any justice.

Justice is for sale, and those with money can buy it.
