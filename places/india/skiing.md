## Gulmarg
- 7.5 km regular, 25 km.
- 4-passenger chairlift, and 3 surface (poma) lifts
- The ski season runs between January 1st and March 31st (it might extend if the conditions are good, safe and stable). In our opinion,the best time to ski Gulmarg is between the 3rd week of January to late-February. That's when we typically get the most snow. March can suprisingly be very good, with a very low amount of tourists and many storms.
- Ski lift tickets are available in single tickets, daily, weekly or season passes. Tickets can be purchased online at [jk](https://www.jammukashmircablecar.com/), in person at the "Gondola ticket block" in Gulmarg, the Srinagar Airport, the Srinagar Tourist Reception Center, and the J&K State Cable Car Corporation Office in Katra and Jammu. I would recommend buying single ride tickets on most days. 
- Sometimes the Gulmarg Gondola shuts down due to heavy snowstorm conditions or mechanical difficulties. For this reason, we recommend that you only purchase single day lift tickets in case the Gondola is not operating. It is sometimes possible to get the ticket signed on the back and reuse it the next day but not always.
