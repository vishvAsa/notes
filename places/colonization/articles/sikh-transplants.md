Sikhs who buy land in N. America and build farm communities depend on getting a lot of pendu cousins to immigrate. Entire pinds get transplanted from Punjab to Kanedda. Like soldiers, farmers also depend on social capital and know-how. Not easy to learn.

## Deployment
Sikhs see pendu farmer/soldier connection as prestigious. Urbanized as contemptible and patted on the back only so long as they use their connections and education to further the goals of the community. Average N. American Gurdwara has truck drivers and surgeons serving langar together.

They send their kids into professions that are strategic. Logistics (right from management to trucking). In India, in the years leading up to the current chapter of Khalistanism, many Sikh youth became journalists and entered media houses - not just in India but in the West. Etc.

## War mindset
Everything is war. That's their philosophy. Every generation must have a story to tell their kids, about the wars they waged. Their own line of martyrs. Etc.
