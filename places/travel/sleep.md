## Metrics
- The R-Value is a measure of the thermal insulation. It measures the ability of a mattress to retain or prevent heat from escaping from a warm body (human body) to a cold floor. The higher the R-Value, the better the insulation of the mattress. 
- R-Values can be added; this means that you can use two mattresses and add their R-Values.
- R-value from 0 to 1.9: Hot season (summer) only R-value from 2 to 3: 2 or 3-season (spring-summer-autumn) R-value from 3 to 4: 4-season R-value of 4.5 and higher: Use in all 4 seasons and in extreme conditions (glacier, far north and high altitudes)
- Testing standard standard ASTM F3340-18.
