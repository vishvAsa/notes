## Hiking style

My personal hiking style during early hikes was to move along fast and rest. In descent, this translated to flowing down like a river - a sort of controlled falling, attention being strongly focused on getting good grips for the feet. I sustained no injuries, and I often was ahead of the rest of the pack. I liked the focus and the opportunity to feel like merging with nature, and being alone with it.
