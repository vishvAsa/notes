## Hiking style

My personal hiking style during early hikes was to move along fast and rest. In descent, this translated to flowing down like a river - a sort of controlled falling, attention being strongly focused on getting good grips for the feet. I sustained no injuries, and I often was ahead of the rest of the pack. I liked the focus and the opportunity to feel like merging with nature, and being alone with it.  

## Operators
### India
> Should always, ALWAYS go with the likes of IndiaHikes, TTH, Bikat Adventures when going on a trek. The likes of Thrillophillia, Cox and Kings etc should be avoided at all costs; these guys are just middlemen, theyâ€™ve never seen a trekking trail in their lives nor knows how to conduct one.
> 
> Thrillophila is just bogus. It's an aggregator of small trekking companies. They have no quality checkpoints and they won't take any responsibility either.
