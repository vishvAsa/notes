- बहुदा सद्भावपूरणम्, अन्यत्र तपः, अन्यत्र अर्थः
- तीव्रानन्दस्यानुभूतीनाम् अल्पान्येव ये स्युर् यात्राजन्यानि क्षणानि, तेभ्यो महान् श्रमः

यात्राकुण्डं यदस्माकन् तोषपद्मैस् सुपूरितम्।

## Activities I like.
### Pictures?
I liked taking pictures of extraordinary sights - for memory's sake - though the times when I look back at them are very very rare. I may capture fellow-travellers, though I see no point in taking my own picture.

### Playing with nature.  

While travelling- especially while in the presence of magnificent nature- I like to be challenged physically and intellectually. Rather than standing to the side and mouthing "adbhutaM" or taking pictures, I like to physically interact and play with surroundings. This leads me then to climb trees, descend into ravines, climb tepees, cross cold rapid streams with slippery rocks using all four limbs and so on. At such happy times - rare as they are due to my other ambitions- I reach the limits of my ernergy, ablilities and equipment, and I stop when I sense a real threat to my life - well in time. More comments in the 'Hiking Style' section.

### Interviewing strangers.

I usually take advantage of opportunities to interview strangers with unfamiliar knowledge and occupations - like park rangers, tour guides, tramway operators, paddling instructors, snow-shoe running old man on the Sierra, gurkha porters. I get to be in my curious element without the too-common strain of being careful not to socially screw up. A pleasure.
