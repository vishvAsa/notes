I keep an incomplete list of places visited and hiked. Maybe I'll publish it some day.

> We had a horrible horrifying experience with Yatra.com recently during our Sikkim trip. Inspite of us making full payment 2 weeks ahead of our trip to yatra, they hadn’t even paid a single subcontractor of theirs and everyone from hotels to cab drivers were behind us for the money. We even received some threatening calls from few of them that without us paying them they won’t be allowing us to return back. - MD
