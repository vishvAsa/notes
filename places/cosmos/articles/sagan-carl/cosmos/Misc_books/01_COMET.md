What are these graceful visitors to our skies? We now know that they bring both life and death and teach us about our origins. In *Comet*, Pulitzer Prize-winning astronomer Carl Sagan and writer Ann Druyan explore the origin, nature, and future of comets, and the exotic myths and portents attached to them. Lavishly illustrated and including new material, this edition of *Comet* is indispensable for anyone who has ever gazed up at the heavens and wondered why.
