Carl Sagan

In this final book of his astonishing career, Carl Sagan brilliantly examines the burning questions of our lives, our world, and the universe around us. These luminous, entertaining essays travel both the vastness of the cosmos and the intimacy of the human mind. Here, too, is a rare private glimpse of Saganâ€™s thoughts about love, death, and spirituality as he struggled with fatal disease. Ever forward-looking and vibrant with the sparkle of his unquenchable curiosity, *Billions & Billions* is a testament to one of the great scientific minds of our day.
