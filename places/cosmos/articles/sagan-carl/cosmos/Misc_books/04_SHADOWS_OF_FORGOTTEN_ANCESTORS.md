A thrilling account of how humans got to be the way we are, *Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors* begins its saga with the origin of the Earth and shows that many of our key traits—self-awareness, family ties, reason, ethics, submission to authority, and hatred for those who are different—are rooted in the deep past and illuminated by our kinship with other animals.
