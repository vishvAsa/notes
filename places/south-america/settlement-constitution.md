## पृष्ठभूमिका Background
- India
  - dense population. Famine + war looming post-oil-collapse (150 yrs).  
- Latin America 
  - low population density, plenty land+water.  
  - Locals look like us - so less conflict (though it will be there).

The population/ resource density difference is stark.

The alternative is to convince dvija-s to transition to Indian villages soon and prepare (also being [encouraged](https://https://t.me/+aZpV3KvbSj1iZDUx)). When famine hits, they'll be in a worse (though not hopeless) position relative to new-worlders - lands and harvest snatched, jihadists and bandits etc.. 

## ध्येयम् Objective
- Weather the coming collapse of industrial civilization (explained in background) by returning closer to nature
- Nurture nobility, wildness without savagery
- Retain knowledge and wonder about our universe to the extant possible. 
- Adore nature.
- Adore the Gods and ancestors mainly via Hindu customs (adapted to the context).
- Perpetuate general and family-specific values and skills accross generations.
- Pass our values and knowledge to deserving outsiders to the extant they grok it; and maybe collaborate with them.

## मार्गः 
- Preferably good founder size - going for 500 families. If too short, local converts might be around. There are also nearby countries (eg. suriname) with decent H population.
- Family is the main organizational unit.
- Investment of time and money in rustic life (eg. ranches) even while working "modern" jobs if needed.
- Be habitually armed.
- Cohesion to the extant possible
  - Lingua franca - sanskrit (founders are fluent in it.) Easy to learn by immersion within a few days.
- Location - being considered [elsewhere](../settlement-prospects).
