Soil in amazon basin - 

> The amazing thing is that the soil is as poor in nutrients as the vegetation is rich. The humus layer, which is that dark, organic stuff in the soil that develops when plants or animal matter break down, is minimal nearly everywhere. The soil in the Amazon rainforest is the poorest and most infertile in the world. If one cuts down the forest, it is irretrievably lost. The humus layer is quickly washed out. Three years after clearing the forest (at the latest, nothing will grow there. What remains is washed out, worthless soil. ... Most nutrients are absorbed by the plants and do not get into the soil at all.

### Assimilation and identity
#### Failures
> nietzsche's sister & brother in law founded an "aryan" colony in middle of paraguay in 1800's, it failed, most who remain are mixed. There was also a socialist aussie utopian community for goras founded there, similar story.

Japanese government sponsored colonies were established in paraguay etc.. Most descendents are Roman catholics now.

Forced assimilation:

> In March 1814, Francia imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos, Amerindians, or Africans. This was done to eliminate any socioeconomic disparities along racial lines, and also to end the predominantly criollo and peninsulare influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo, but feared that racial disparities would create tensions that could threaten his absolute rule.

Argentina's "black disappearance".

#### Successes
There's a thriving Welsh colony in Patagonia from the late 1800s. 

### Deciding Factors
- post-oil prosperity
  - arable land and water per capita
- current prosperity
- social cohesion / crime rates; long term stability
- avg local IQ (if descendents are to mix with locals)
- diseases - it would be good to avoid tropical disease load in the post-industrial world. eg. filaria ...
- human friendly climate/ altitude
- expanse of the country - mountains, forests, desert, seas

### Rjrasva list
Looking at level of econ development + crime rates + long term stability the following would qualify: Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, & Peru.

You might also have to consider labor demand 20 yrs later based on current TFR's & several of these r ultra low TFR

## Guyana
28% Hindu - jAti dissolved.  
Poor representation in army.

Nutrient poor soil. 

### Flooding
> "Guyana is most at risk to floods and droughts. Guyana has experienced many floods in recent years that are heavily influenced by La NiÃ±a events. The country's low-lying coastline, which in some areas is 2 m below sea level, causes flooding to be an imminent threat."

### Conflict
Also Indo-Guyanese have just recently undergone ethnic cleansing. Source: [TW](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AvCJLeb2LtNqzIJ6PhexXEmrZcSBFv39/view?usp=sharing)

#### Resource-richness
World power vying to destabilize and control.

## Uruguay
Most developed in South America.

## Chile
> Chile doesn't have a lot of arable land compared to argentina but after uruguay it's the 2nd wealthiest in latin am, stable, & above all it has a lot of copper & other minerals. It is also more mestizo than argentina & uruguay which are more euro. Chilean passport is also the most powerful & citizenship is passed down all the way to grandkids, in most other countries only till your kids.
