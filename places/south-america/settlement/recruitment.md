## Target
Shooting for 500 families.

If too short:

- One is left with countries (eg. suriname) with decent preexisting H population.
- Local converts might be around - though that's much harder and unlikely to work.

## Strategy
If we can attract maTha-s of various sampradAya-s to co-locate - say near hastinApur, argentina - that could attract the "right crowds". That's all we need expect from them.

Potentials:

- suguNendra tIrtha
- https://www.ramanujamission.org/introduction/sri-ramanuja-mission-usa/
- chinna jIyar
- ramakrishna mission
- iskcon
