## Intro
- Latin America - low population density, plenty land+water.  
- India- dense population. Famine + war looming post-oil-collapse (150 yrs).  
- Locals look like us - so less conflict (though it will be there).
- Preserve H culture there with an agrarian colony.

### Flooding
> "Guyana is most at risk to floods and droughts. Guyana has experienced many floods in recent years that are heavily influenced by La Ni√±a events. The country's low-lying coastline, which in some areas is 2 m below sea level, causes flooding to be an imminent threat."
