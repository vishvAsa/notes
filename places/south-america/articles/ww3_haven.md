Argentina is remarkably beautiful but also a safe haven against a possible WWIII. I explain:

In October 2023, a group of six friends,  
including myself, pooled resources to acquire a ranch in Mendoza, Argentina.  
We bought this property both for its natural beauty  
and as a sanctuary from the looming threat of a Third World War.  
The ranch, named Wamani,  
encompasses 24,000 hectares of untamed wilderness,  
nestled an hour's drive south of the famed Uco Valley wine country.  
Inside our ranch there is a mountain of over 5000 meters  
that so far we have failed to conquer  
but we hope to do so during our next trip.  
We are planning to build residences there for ourselves  
and like minded entrepreneurs from different countries.  
Local authorities have greeted our investment with open arms  
at a time in which Argentina is experiencing economic hardship  
after many years of economic mismanagement.  
My partners and are are very bullish on the new government of Argentina.

Our decision to buy the land was not only motivated by trust in Javier Milei policies  
but also by a rising concern about the tensions and geopolitical instability in the world.  
We believe that a major conflict is sadly, increasingly likely,  
and we wanted to find a safe haven for our friends and family in my native Argentina.  
What we see is four dictators whose regimes are in trouble,  
Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, who are allied in destroying the world as we know it and impose their fascist rules to all of us  
not in a disimilar way that Hitler, Mussolini and the Japanese regime tried in World War II.  
While democracies thrive in peace dictatorships unify their subjects by attacking neighbors and starting wars as we have seen with Russia attacking Ukraine, Iran attacking Israel and possibly soon China attacking Taiwan and North Korea attacking South Korea.

In a world where World War III is a possibility,  
Argentina emerged as the ideal safe haven for several reasons.  
First, I am Argentine so it's a natural personal choice,  
but you don't need to be Argentine to think this way. Argentina is open to immigrants from USA and Europe  
and it is a remarkably self-sufficient country with a strong agricultural sector.  
It produces enough food to sustain 400 million people—more than six times its own population.+++(5)+++  
This makes it a valuable asset in times of crisis,  
when food supplies may be disrupted especially in the case of a nuclear winter.+++(5)+++

Second, Argentina has a long-standing tradition of non-intervention in global conflicts.  
It has remained neutral in major wars, including both World Wars and the Cold War.  
This neutrality has earned it a reputation as a safe haven, shielded from the ravages of major wars.

Third, Argentina is geographically remote from potential conflict zones.  
It is located at the southern tip of South America,  
far from the major powers and their military alliances.  
This remoteness provides an additional layer of protection from the potential fallout of a global conflict.  
If there was a nuclear war some people would die on impact, 
some because of ensuing radiation but most from the dust from explosions  
that sent into the troposphere creates the so called nuclear winter,  
the most dangerous form of climate catastrophe.+++(5)+++  
But Argentina is protected from nuclear impacts because of its lack of nuclear weapons itself,  
of the radiation because of distance to centers of war, and from nuclear winter as it has tremendous excess of food production and models  
show it would not be affected by nuclear winter.

As a Jewish person, I am also particularly mindful of the horrors that war can inflict on minority communities.  
Argentina has a long history of welcoming Jewish immigrants,  
and Argentine Jews have not been subjected to major attacks or forced to fight in wars.  
This makes it a particularly attractive destination for those seeking refuge from persecution.  
Even the president of Argentina Javier Milei is considering converting to Judaism.

Our investment in Wamani is not merely a matter of acquiring recreational property  
regardless of the fact that Mendoza is stunningly beautiful—  
it is a quest for security and sanctuary in an increasingly uncertain world.  
My hope is that we only get to enjoy it for its beauty, during frequent visits,  
and that it never needs to become a safe haven during a nuclear World War III.  
But if we had a pandemic with 18 million unexpected deaths we don't believe WWIII is out of the question.

In the meantime I do recommend to the Milei "no hay plata" government ,  
that it does what USA, Spain and many other countries do,  
and start a golden visa program for hard working citizens of other countries  
who share our concern and would like to own property in Argentina.  
This program could result in significant investment in the country.  
If only 10000 people invest $1m each that is an extra 10 billion of foreign direct investment in Argentina's economy.
