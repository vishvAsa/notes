What if I told you there was a single intervention we could deliver in our cities that would cool them during heatwaves, reduce flooding, scrub pollutants from the air, boost biodiversity, improve public health, and even reduce crime? You wouldn't believe me. But it's true.

What if I told you one study in Manchester found that shade from street trees reduced surface temperatures by an average of 12°C and that concrete surfaces shaded permanently by a bank of trees were cooled by up to 20°C in the summer? You wouldn't believe me. But it's true.

What if I told you that a single young tree planted in a small pit over an impermeable asphalt surface can reduce rain runoff by around 60%, even during winter when not in leaf? You wouldn't believe me, but it's true.

What if I told you a line of young silver birch roadside trees resulted in over 50% reductions in PM levels within the row of terraced houses screened from the road? You wouldn't believe me, but it's true.

What if told you that urban trees support a rich and diverse range of wildlife; providing important connectivity between isolated pockets of fragmented habitats, mitigating the negative effects of urbanisation for species such as bats? You wouldn't believe me, but it's true.

What if I told you that a high number of street trees close to the home is related to lower numbers of local prescriptions for antidepressants, even when controlling for a wide range of factors, such as deprivation? You wouldn't believe me, but it's true.

What if I told you that research has shown that for every 10% increase urban canopy cover there is a 15% decrease in violent crime and a 14% decrease in property crime, controlled for a wide range of socioeconomic factors? You wouldn't believe me, but it's true.
